Today's call is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you and good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple COO, Tim Cook, and Apple Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with analysts.  Today, we are releasing preliminary results of Apple's fourth fiscal quarter. As our press release indicates, these results may be subject to significant adjustment due to the likely restatement of historical results that we have previously disclosed.  Though preliminary, we are providing this information today as we believe it is in investor's best interests that we present current results and the related trends of the business. Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, future products, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and the likely restatement of historical financial results pending the determination of appropriate accounting treatment for Apple's historical stock option granting practices.  Actual results and trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2005, the Form 10-Q for the first and second fiscal quarters of 2006, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report very strong preliminary results for the fourth quarter, and the best Mac shipments by far in any quarter in Apple's history.  The quarter's revenue was $4.84 billion, representing 32% year-over-year growth. The strong revenue was fueled by robust sales of our Mac portable products, a successful back-to-school season, and the continued popularity of our music products.  Preliminary operating margin for the quarter was 12.6%, and preliminary net income was $546 million, or $0.62 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. I would like to talk first about our Mac products, which represented 58% of our total quarterly revenue. We shipped a total of 1.61 million Macs, significantly greater than the previous quarterly record of 1.38 million Macs sold in the first quarter of Apple's fiscal 2000.  Our September quarter Mac shipments grew 30% over the prior year, which is more than three times IBC's latest published market growth projections for the quarter. We believe this growth rate is particularly remarkable, given the tough comparison to the prior year's September quarter, which was up 48% year over year.  The strong growth in Mac sales was largely due to unprecedented demand for our portable products, with sales of nearly 1 million units, representing 61% of all Macs sold during the quarter.  Ending channel inventory of Macs was below our target range of four to five weeks. With our Mac Pro launch in August, we have transitioned all of our Macs to the Intel architecture in nine months. We are extremely pleased with our team's speed and skill in executing this complex transition, and our developers continue to make great progress as well.  There are over 4,000 universal applications available today and we estimate that by the end of December, 80% of the 500 Mac applications we consider most important to our customers will be available in universal versions. Our music products generated another quarter of strong results, representing 42% of total company revenue and increasing 36% year over year. iPod shipments grew 35% year over year, to $8.73 million, bolstered by the announcement of our new iPods on September 12th, and our very popular back-to-school promotion.  Reviews of the new iPods have been very positive, and we are very confident in our new line-up, despite increased competition this holiday season.  Channel inventory of iPods as of the end of the quarter was within our target range of four to six weeks on a look-back basis. The iTunes store continues to be the world's leading online music store, and now offers movies in addition to over 3.5 million songs, 220 television programs, 9,000 music videos, and 20,000 audiobooks. Based on the latest data available from Nielsen SoundScan, iTunes accounts for 85% of songs purchased and downloaded in the U.S.  The iPod ecosystem continues to thrive, with over 3,000 accessory products currently available. We estimate that over 70% of the 2007 model year cars sold in the U.S. will offer direct iPod integration as an option. The Apple retail stores posted very strong results. Revenue for the quarter was $936 million, up 41% year over year, and segment operating profit was $50 million. For the full year, revenue from the stores increased by over $1 billion, and average revenue per store grew to almost $24 million.  We opened 10 new stores during the September quarter, ending with 165. With an average of 158 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5.9 million.  The stores sold a record 323,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 60% year-over-year growth. Based on our latest survey, over 50% of the customers buying Macs in our stores were new to the Mac. Applying that rate to the quarter's results, we estimate that the average store added about 1,000 new Mac customers during the quarter.  Over 20 million people visited the stores during the quarter, and customers attended over 125,000 personal training sessions. Our education channel had an outstanding quarter, selling a record number of Macs, driving 20% year-over-year growth. We are particularly pleased with this growth, which is significantly greater than IDC's most recently published forecast for the U.S. education market for the quarter. It was the most successful back-to-school quarter ever for our higher ed business, where shipments of Mac portables increased 49% year over year. This result was due in large part to the popularity of the MacBook in higher ed, as well as our very successful back-to-school promotion. In terms of geographic results, including sales from our retail stores, quarterly revenue in the Americas, Europe, and Japan was up 33%, 27%, and 26% respectively.  Preliminary gross margin was 29.2% on a GAAP basis, about 80 basis points higher than our guidance, primarily due to product mix. Included in GAAP cost of goods sold was $5 million of stock-based compensation expense.  Preliminary GAAP operating expenses were $803 million, including $34 million in expense related to stock-based compensation. Op-ex was about $17 million higher than guidance, primarily due to higher-than-expected revenue.  OI&E was $113 million, about $13 million higher than guidance, largely due to higher-than-expected cash balances and higher-than-expected yields on cash investments.  The tax rate for the quarter was about 24%, below our guidance of 32%, due to a one-time credit resulting from the settlement of prior-year tax audits in the United States, and proportionately higher-than-anticipated operating income from foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates.  We had a very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by $934 million, to end with over $10.1 billion. This was primarily a function of strong earnings and working capital management. Looking ahead to the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which excludes the impact of any restatement and includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.  For the quarter, we are targeting revenue between $6 billion and $6.2 billion.  We expect total quarterly costs of non-cash, stock-based compensation to be approximately $45 million.  We expect GAAP gross margin to be about 28.25%, reflecting approximately $6 million related to stock-based compensation expense.  We expect GAAP op-ex to be about $905 million to $920 million, including about $39 million related to stock-based compensation expense.  We expect OI&E to be about $120 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%.  We expect to generate GAAP EPS of about $0.70 to $0.73, including an anticipated $0.03 per share related to non-cash, share-based compensation expense. In closing, we are very proud of our accomplishments of the company in fiscal 2006. We sold over 5.3 million Macs, representing our best year ever, and we reached new heights with iPod shipments, selling more than 39 million.  We generated $19.3 billion in revenue, representing 39% year-over-year growth, and we have added $11 billion in top-line growth in the last two years. We skillfully executed an incredibly complex architecture transition, converting our entire Mac line to Intel microprocessors in nine months.  We remain committed to innovation and we are very enthusiastic about our product pipeline. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from David Bailey - Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you very much. Two short questions, please. Can you help us understand the impact of the lower price points associated with the new iPods are going to have on your blended ASP and gross margin for the December quarter? Just a follow-up, the component environment has been very favorable the past few quarters, can you give us your outlook on the remainder of the year for your component prices?\nPeter Oppenheimer: David, I'll start with the iPod questions and Tim can discuss the component environment. As a result of the price reductions that we took on September 12th and the introduction of the new $79 Shuffle, we believe that our ASPs and iPods will be down in the December quarter from what they were in September, but we are very excited about the line that we just announced and are looking forward to the holiday season and confident.\nTim Cook: David, in the notebook hard drive area, we expect that since supply exceeds demand in this area, there'll be favorable pricing. For DRAM, NAND Flash, and LCD panels, demand trailer exceeds supply due to the usual seasonal demands. We expect other commodities to decline consistent with historical trends.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, David. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Richard Gardner - Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thank you very much. I had two questions. One, I was hoping, Peter, you could give us the typical walkthrough on the pluses and minuses for gross margins in the fourth quarter. Secondly, was hoping you could give us a status update on your retail pilots with incremental retail customers?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Rich, as I said in my prepared remarks, the gross margin declined by about 110 basis points in the September quarter from the June quarter, which was actually less than what we had guided down. We had guided down closer to 200 basis points. The reason for this difference was primarily a better mix of higher margin products.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Actually, Peter, could you give us the same walkthrough for the December quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: For the December quarter? Sure. Guiding margin down about a point as a result of the quarter having much higher iPod and other music product sales and also having a full quarter of the lower iPod pricing.\nTim Cook: Rich, in terms of expanding distribution on the Macintosh, as you know, we've had a pilot going by in seven stores. We've just concluded this week to expand that during this quarter to over 50. The stores are located around the country, and they will be selling both desktops and notebooks as well as some Mac software and accessories. We'll continue to evaluate how the program is going over the next several months to conclude what the next step should be. We're also running a small pilot with Circuit City which we really just started and there's no data available. But we will obviously monitor that and conclude what to do with that in the future.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: All right. Thanks a lot.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Bill Richards - UBS.\nBill Richards - UBS: Good afternoon, thanks. So Steve says in this release that 2007 will be one of the most exciting product years in the history of Apple. Does that mean we should all show up for MacWorld? What does that mean versus 2006? Any other comments?\nTim Cook: Ben, as you know, we don't comment on our product road map in terms of specifics, but we are very confident of what we have in the pipeline and very excited that our customers will be pleased with it.\nBill Richards - UBS: I guess with regard to a couple of other things. With regard to other music, that line was a little below expectations while virtually every other line was much better than expected. Is there something going on with download habits, Peter or Tim, and can you elaborate there? Should that line pick up with the addition of movies?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, in the quarter, it was relatively flat sequentially, but up over 70% year-over-year. In the quarter, we reduced our channel inventory on the Apple-branded iPod accessories in advance of our announcements on September 12th, so that played into it. Also, the summer is usually not the best quarter for music sales. People are on vacation and it generally is not the strongest quarter for new album releases either.\nBill Richards - UBS: So you would expect that to pick up quite a bit into the holidays, normal seasonality? Nothing special to --\nPeter Oppenheimer: Not providing a quantitative forecast, but qualitatively, seasonally, and with album releases, we have seen that in the past.\nBill Richards - UBS: Lastly, inventory and receivables went up. Was that in line with your expectations? Looks like channel inventory is okay, but what about those two lines? What are you preparing for the on the inventory line, or what does it say about the linearity of the quarter on the AR side?\nPeter Oppenheimer: In terms of inventory, it was up about $100 million year-over-year. We've opened 41 stores this year. Virtually all of the increase in inventory is in the retail stores to serve customers. As it relates to accounts receivables, they were up a little over $350 million, but as I said in my prepared remarks, in the last two years, we've added $11 billion in top line growth. The DSO performance was very strong in the quarter at 24 days.\nBill Richards - UBS: All right. So the inventory was due to increased stores and getting ready for the holidays?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes.\nBill Richards - UBS: Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns.\nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Two things. Just a point of clarification. Japan, the CPUs were down. Can you give us background on what's going on in Japan? Second, to the extent you can talk about with the ongoing investigation, can you give us some sense about the role that you've clarified that Steve Jobs may have in this options investigation?\nPeter Oppenheimer: As we reported about two weeks ago in our release, the special committee of Apple's board with its independent advisors reported their key findings. One of which was that the investigation found no misconduct by any member of Apple's current management team, and that includes Steve.\nTim Cook: Andy, on the Japan side, when you combine the channel results with our retail store results, Macintosh units on a year-over-year basis declined by 10%. The market in Japan is among the weakest in the world and IBC was also expecting a contraction during the quarter.  However, having said that, we're not pleased with our performance there and we've got a number of activities underway to attempt to improve them. I would point out that despite the reduction in the Macintosh area that from a year-over-year point of view, revenue was up 26% in Japan on strong iPod sales.\nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: That's what I was trying to understand, because the CPUs were down, but the revenues were up strongly so I was trying to clarify that.\nTim Cook: Yes, and that's due to strong iPod sales.\nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Okay, Tim. Thanks very much.\nNancy Paxton: Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Bill Shope - JP Morgan.\nBill Shope - JP Morgan: Great, thanks. Can you guys give us an update on the progress you're seeing in the international markets with the iPod as you did last quarter? Then on the iTunes side, do the video sales have similar economics to music sales, as you've said in the past, or is this changing as U.S. scales the video business?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, we don't report individual product gross margins, but we're running the music store at above breakeven levels. Our view continues to be that selling music and TV shows and now movies helps us to sell iPod and accessories.  As it relates to international iPod results, we continue to be happy with our progress. In the U.K., Canada, Japan, and Australia, our market share ranges from 40 to 50% and in many western European countries, we've picked up market share year-over-year, typically 6 to 7 points in place like France and Germany and Italy and Spain.\nBill Shope - JP Morgan: Great, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kathy Huberty - Morgan Stanley.\nKathy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Just going back to inventory and channel inventories for Macs, do you feel you can get that back to normal levels ahead of the holiday season?\nTim Cook: We did drop below the four to five weeks, as Peter said in his opening remarks. That was due primarily to very, very strong demand on the MacBook and a great reception to the iMac that we announced in early September, the new lineup of iMac. I do anticipate being able to get the channel back to reasonable levels during the quarter, but I'm not forecasting what will happen at the end of the quarter.\nKathy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: How should we think about any potential stalls in the Mac business ahead of the Leopard launch next year? Has that typically happened in the past?\nTim Cook: We have all of our thinking embedded in our guidance, but as Steve announced at the developer's conference, the Leopard will be shipping in the spring of next year.\nKathy Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great. Thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Katie. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Robert Semple of Credit Suisse.\nRobert Semple - Credit Suisse: Yes, thanks. Guys, can you characterize the demand for the new Nano launch? I guess in the context of last year, Tim, last year you found the demand staggering and you could only get a million units out the door in the final three-four weeks of September. How did the rollout go this year relative to last?\nTim Cook: The customer reception was excellent, the analyst reviews have been very, very favorable. If you look at the quarter in the months, iPod demand really accelerated significantly post the launch and it was that acceleration that allowed us to exceed our expectations for the quarter.\nRobert Semple - Credit Suisse: Switching gears to the desktop, growth was about 4% year on year, on a unit basis and probably not that surprising given the cannibalization trends we're seeing in the overall market. But as you look at that business going forward, is that a reasonable growth rate you should be looking for or can it improve with new product introductions and things like that?\nTim Cook: We don't forecast out the portable and desktop area, but as you mentioned, there is a widespread movement to portables, and our portables grew 56% year-over-year. So we're incredibly pleased with what is a blowout quarter.\nRobert Semple - Credit Suisse: Okay, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rob. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Harry Blount, Lehman Brothers.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Hi, guys. Thank you very much. A couple of quick questions. One is, Peter, could you give a little bit of a sense on direct and indirect trends? Specifically, you guys highlighted last quarter the focus on improving the international penetration. I was wondering if you are in fact seeing a significant increase in the indirect percentage of the iPods? Also, if you could make some directional comments on the PC side?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Harry, our direct percent in Q4 of the September quarter was 54% in total, and that was up from 50% in the June quarter and the year-ago quarter was 52%. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, our Americas and Europe and Japan revenues were up reasonably closely and I would say that we're very happy with both the performance of our indirect channel and our growth overseas.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: So the change you're seeing, Peter, is that similar then within product categories as well, the iPods versus the PCs?\nPeter Oppenheimer: As you know, the iPod has a much broader distribution. It's a little less than 40,000 points around the world, direct and indirect. And Mac distribution is a little over 7,000 points.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Okay. You guys have made significant improvements in the bill of materials on the iPod. Would it be fair to say that the iPods have now achieved similar gross margins as the PC product line?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I don't want to comment quite that specifically. I will say that the iPods' gross margin was above 20% in the September quarter, but the gross margin was down a bit from the June quarter as a result of the price reductions that we took in September and our transition.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Last question is, you mentioned traffic in the stores greater than 20 million, can you be a bit more specific?\nPeter Oppenheimer: It was a bit above 20 million. The performance in the stores was just outstanding. The revenue was $934 million. We were up year-over-year 41%. Mac sales were up 60%. Our new to Mac for Mac sales actually went over 50% this quarter. And it's amazing, given that we've sold 323,000 Macs in the quarter, that a little more than half of the people had never owned a Mac before. We were thrilled by that.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffrey.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon. The 1.5 or 1.6 Mac number is obviously impressive. As you look at that number, is there any way for us to think about what potentially could be pent-up demand in that number versus the pure demand? I guess it's a difficult question, but how do you think about this kind of tradeoff?\nTim Cook: Gene, I think the Mac results were a combination of us completing the Intel transition. The exceptional customer response to the innovative products that included those that were transitioned and very, very strong back to school and education sales including two large K-12 deals that totaled 50,000 units during the quarter.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: As you look at the December quarter, can you remind us last year, I know that the iMac was pretty successful in the December quarter. Does the baton get shifted for the holiday quarter to the iMac from the notebooks? Is that one way to look at it, or is there any differentiation there?\nTim Cook: In the holiday quarter, typically the consumer side of the house does extremely well and consumers are buying both notebooks and desktops.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Lastly on the Shuffle, any idea on when that's going to be shipping?\nTim Cook: We will ship by the end of October.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Next question, please.\nOperator: That will come from Shannon Cross - Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Just a couple questions. Can you give us any color on boot camp downloads? What are your surveys saying, people are coming, over 50% in the store are switchers, are they looking running OSX or Windows?\nTim Cook: On boot camp, Shannon, we're over 1 million downloads, which we are very, very pleased with. We continue to have a plan to integrate boot camp in Leopard next spring.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Regarding the performance in the stores, again, this quarter we went over 50% new to Mac and I think customers are coming in looking at Macs based upon just our great hardware, the stability of OSX, the great iLife software and the great experience they're having in the stores.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Can you give any metrics in terms of iTunes stores, games were just launched, videos. What kind of take rates? At one point, I heard a goal of 1 million videos, or movies per week, by the end of the year. Is that still a goal?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We will likely re-release game and movie sales at a future date. I don't want to comment specifically, but we are very happy with the performance of the iTunes store with everything that it's selling, and as I said, we think it's a big reason why people are buying iPods and accessories and certainly think it's helping us in the Mac business.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, Peter, just a clarification on tax rate, you said 32% going forward, but are any of the foreign tax benefits in terms of the mix shift of revenue ongoing, in which case maybe we'll see a lower tax rate?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We contemplated that in the guidance that I've given you for the first quarter.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Next question, please.\nOperator: That will come from Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch.\nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I understand you don't want to give specific gross margin numbers by products, but maybe in the same spirit as what you said qualitatively and directionally about the iPod gross margins, are you able to give a similar color on the Mac gross margin in the September quarter, how that changed sequentially?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes, I don't want to be that specific. The Mac margins, we are quite happy within the September quarter and that was one of the reasons why our gross margin exceeded the guidance that we gave and part of the product mix that we saw.\nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Another one, a little off the beaten path, but I just wonder what you think of Google\u2019s purchase of YouTube? As you think longer term about the evolution of the video distribution market, outside the mainstream content providers, how do you think the landscape is changing and does any of that affect your business? What do you think of that?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, I think I'll let the people at Google comment on YouTube, but we continue to believe that video will be big in the portable space, not only in PCs but in iPods and we certainly look forward to participating in that going forward.\nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Okay, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Richard. Next question, please.\nOperator: Chris Whitmore from Deutsche, bank.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Question on channel inventories for iPod. Can you give any color to the recently released products versus previous generation products?\nTim Cook: We don't give the specific breakout, but I see no issue in clearing the remaining inventory on the products we're shipping previous to the launch.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Can you provide, maybe quantify the number of iPods that were shipped in conjunction with the back to school promotion. How much did that help iPod units in the quarter?\nTim Cook: The back to school promotion was a key factor in having excellent education results. We don't disclose the exact number.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Lastly on the MacPro uptake. Any color on customer reception for that upgrade and to what extent is demand still pent up as we're waiting for key applications, like Creative Suite to become universal before we see better shipments for that product?\nTim Cook: Both customer and analyst reaction has been very, very positive on the Mac Pro announcement that we made in August. We are still seeing what we believe is a delay in purchasing that we think primarily is associated with applications, in particular, the Creative Suite.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Thanks a bunch.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Charles Wolf with Needham.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Co : Hi, guys, I've got a couple of questions. Do you have any preliminary indication of demand for the Shuffle? I've been hearing it could be huge.\nTim Cook: We've been taking orders, obviously, Charlie, from our online store and our channels and we're very excited to get shipments underway in a couple of weeks to really test it.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Co : Yes. My second question is, at the developer's conference, Steve said there would be some new, surprising features in Leopard. My first question is, are there new features that haven't been shown yet? Secondly, could virtualization capabilities be one of them?\nTim Cook: Charlie, as you know, we don't comment on specifics, but as we said in August, we'll be shipping Leopard in the spring.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Co : Okay, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Charlie. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - Banc of America.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America: Peter, in the iPod shipments for the quartercan you give us any color on how much will be ship-in or channel fill?\nPeter Oppenheimer: As we indicated, we ended the quarter within our four to six-week range.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America: Peter, maybe a different way to phrase the question is what is the inventory levels at the end of last quarter?I don't recall in the iPod range. Was there an extra week that may have been put out there in the September quarter?\nTim Cook: Keith, we both began and ended the quarter within this target range. On an absolute number of unit basis, we had a small increase that was due to the transition that we made in September in order to get enough new products into the channel.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America: Less than a few hundred thousand units?\nTim Cook: A very small increase.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America: Okay, fair enough. Thank you. On the same-store sales, Peter, can you give us any color there on the retail side? I know you added some stores, what was the same-stores sales growth?\nPeter Oppenheimer: It was up a couple of percent. The Mac sales, as you can see, were up very strong year-over-year. They were up 60% in units. iPod sales in total were up, but impacted on a per-store basis because we've got a much wider distribution capability this year than we did last. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we've got a little under 40,000 points of sale for the iPod around the world.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America: I'm not sure I followed that. If you had same-store sales, you're saying it would be marginally positive on year-over-year basis?\nPeter Oppenheimer: No, total iPod sales were up in total, but on a per-store basis, they were down a little bit as a result of the increase in the channel distribution.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America: Okay. Thanks very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Keith. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Blair - Wedge Partners.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: Hi, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment at all on any iPod or marketing promotions you're doing in the international markets right now that are different from what we're seeing in the U.S.? If there's anything special going on to try to drive demand in some of the international markets?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. We have some work that we're doing with Coke in Europe, specifically in the U.K. and Germany. They are going to put a specific web site out that is linked directly into iTunes and they will be giving away 70 million free songs over the next month or two.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: Okay, great. Are there any updates on any of the iTunes stores launching in international markets? It seems like in a number of countries, like Japan, the iPod sales really preceeded iTunes stores for whatever reason. Any update you can give on iTunes as it progresses in international markets, movie downloads in international markets, et cetera?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We today have the iTunes music store in 21 countries, which is covering off close to 90% of where music is legally purchased. We look forward to bringing movies international in 2007.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: Okay, great. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Brian. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shaw Wu, American Technology Research.\nShaw Wu - American Technology Research : Just one quick one on iTV, any initial feedback you can provide us on that product? Second, any comment on what type of units this product could be? Is it a couple hundred thousand units, or a multimillion type of product.\nTim Cook: We announced that product before shipping it to give customers a total view of the solution that we're bringing to market as we announced the down loading of movies. We are not projecting the sales of it in the future. We will be shipping it in the first calendar quarter of next year.\nShaw Wu - American Technology Research : Okay, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shaw. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Jarvis - Boston Company.\nJohn Jarvis - Boston Company : Hi, Peter. I seem to recall last year in the December quarter you had an extra week. I was wondering if you could give us any additional metrics in terms of how that may have affected iPods or Mac units, just to get our arms around forecasting that for this upcoming quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Last year it was a 14-week quarter for us as we realign our calendar every six or seven years. The iPod shipments in the year ago quarter were certainly benefited by that 14th week, which fell between Christmas and New Year's and as we told you last January, we increased our channel inventories in the quarter by about 550,000 units. So you're thinking through iPods, you should account for the 14th week and an increase in inventory and if you're thinking through Mac sales, certainly contemplate a 14th week.\nNancy Paxton: Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Fearnley, FTN Midwest.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Thanks, two questions on the guidance. When you look at the economic environment and the consumer in particular, could you give us a view of what you're seeing there as we approach the holiday season? How does that affect guidance? And I have a follow-up.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gary will take your first question.\nGary Wipfler: Again, this would be generally speaking, it's from a macro point of view, but the economy is slowing because the Fed has hiked 17 times over the last two or three years. But what most of us are hearing from economists out there is that economists think that the economy is headed for a soft landing and the consumer appears resilient in that, especially as energy prices have eased. We intend to agree with this outlook, barring any surprises.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Thanks. When you look at availability for the upcoming quarter, you come into the quarter having channel inventory that's below expectations. Do you expect being below target inventory here for Macintoshes for a good chunk of the fourth quarter, or do you expect to see some recovery in the beginning of the quarter?\nTim Cook: Channel inventory is a function of both supply and demand. We've factored our thinking on both of those into our guidance that Peter has already laid out.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Do you think you'll have to air freight anything in, or do you think the recovery is going to be manageable here, or do you really have to hustle to get stuff in here into the states to catch up?\nTim Cook: We typically air freight portables and we would continue to do that this quarter. Last quarter we also air freighted iMacs because of their popularity in September and we would continue to do so for a portion of those in the current quarter.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Then one last question on iTunes, if I could. Could you give any more color on profitability of movies versus music? Any update on that since you're getting further down the road here with videos?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, we don't give products' specific gross margins; our philosophy is to run the store a little bit over breakeven.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Lidberg - Pacific Crest Securities.\nSteve Lidberg - Pacific Crest Securities: Good afternoon. Peter, I was hoping you could provide some thoughts with regards to your ability to attract additional major studio content into the feature film category for iTunes. If there is hesitation or hurdles, what are you facing there? Thanks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Last October we announced TV shows with just five programs and within a year have over 220 today from over 40 networks. We've just launched movie downloads with one studio and have 75 titles and we plan to add more over time.\nSteve Lidberg - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Steve. Next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Hoopes, ThinkEquity Partners.\nJonathan Hoopes - ThinkEquity Partners: Thank you very much. Three questions on the retail. Peter, could you tell us how many retail store employees you had?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes. We have about 5,800 people in our retail stores.\nJonathan Hoopes - ThinkEquity Partners: Okay, thank you. Also on retail, did you mention what the CapEx was for the retail segment?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I didn't, but I would be happy to. Our CapEx in the quarter was $134 million and the retail portion of that was $50 million.\nJonathan Hoopes - ThinkEquity Partners: Great, thanks. One last one. Did you mention what the manufacturing margin was for retail?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I didn't. It was $188 million.\nJonathan Hoopes - ThinkEquity Partners: Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Jonathan. We have time for one final question.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Jesse Tortora from Prudential.\nJesse Tortora - Prudential: Thanks for taking my call. Pete, what do you see the key levers that could provide upside or downside for this quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I'll make a few comments and Tim can chime in. Certainly the level of sales and the mix within the products would be big levers and direct versus indirect sales would be another lever.\nTim Cook: Obviously, commodity costs are another one, although I believe we have a reasonable handle on those. So I think the greatest ones are the top line.\nJesse Tortora - Prudential: Great. And lastly, have you seen a pickup in either iMac or iPod following the September price moves?\nTim Cook: The post-launch in iPod, we saw an acceleration of demand and it was that acceleration that allowed us to exceed our expectations for iPod in the quarter. The announcement of the new iMac lineup in early September was extremely well received. We air freighted units to market in order to cut transit times and get them to our customers as quickly as we could. It was partly the iMac that led to a stalling below the four to five week target on the channel inventory.\nJesse Tortora - Prudential: Great. Thanks, guys.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Jesse.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead. \nNancy Paxton : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer. He will be joined by Apple's COO, Tim Cook, and Apple Treasurer, Gary Whistler for the Q-and-A session with analysts.  Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, future products, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and a special committee investigation relating to the company's past stock option grants. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2005, the Form 10-Q for the first and second fiscal quarters of 2006, and our Form 8-K filed with the SEC today.  Please also note that any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's call should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, Apple's GAAP results. A reconciliation of any GAAP and non-GAAP measures discussed is posted on Apple's website at www.apple.com/investor. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the second-highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history.  The quarter's revenue was $4.37 billion, representing 24% year-over-year growth. The strong revenue was fueled by the best Mac unit sales in any 13-week quarter in Apple's history and continued healthy demand for our music products.  Operating margin for the quarter was 13% and net income was $472 million, or $0.54 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impacts of $37 million in non-cash, stock-based compensation expense, operating margin was 13.8%, net income was $499 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.57.  The quarter's robust operating margin was attributable to the revenue growth, a very favorable component environment and solid expense management.  I would like to first talk about our Mac products, which represented 55% of our total quarterly revenue. Mac product revenue increased 11% year over year, fueled by Mac unit shipment growth of 12% year over year, to $1.327 million. Ending channel inventory was within our target range of four to five weeks.  We continue to be very happy with our progress and our developers' progress in the transition to Intel. We have now introduced the iMac, MacBook, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini with Intel processors. We are solidly on track to transition the Power Mac and Xserve by the end of this calendar year.  We have released universal versions of Apple's consumer and professional software applications and our third-party developers have released over 2,900 universal applications. We expect that over 70% of the 500 applications we consider most critical to our customers will be available in universal versions by the end of September.  We have been very pleased with the response to our new Macs, particularly from our consumer and education customers. Intel-based Macs accounted for over 75% of the quarter's Mac shipments.  The MacBook, which we introduced in mid-May, has been extremely well-received and, coupled with our very popular MacBook Pro, has contributed to Apple's increased unit market share of portables in U.S. retail from 6% in January to 12% in June, according to NPD.  We are also very happy with our Mac ad campaign and feel it is contributing to our momentum, particularly with consumers.  We believe that many of our creative professional customers have delayed purchases as they await new Intel-based Mac desktops, universal applications, or both.  Our music products posted another quarter of strong results, representing 45% of total company revenue and increasing 45% year-over-year. iPod shipments grew 32% year over year, consistent with our expectations, and we exited the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.  We continue to be very enthusiastic about iPod. Based on the latest data published by NPD, iPod accounts for over 75% of the U.S. market for MP3 players. iPod is also the top-selling MP3 player in many large markets, such as Canada, Australia, the U.K., France, Spain, Italy and Japan, according to the latest data published from NPD, GFK and BCN.  Other music product revenue was $457 million, up 90% year over year. These results were a function of continued strong sales from the iTunes Music Store and very solid performance for iPod accessories.  The iTunes Music Store continues to lead the industry, accounting for 85% share of the market for legally purchased and downloaded music in the U.S., based on the latest data available from Nielsen SoundScan. We have continued to enhance and expand the iTunes Music Store, now offering over 3 million songs, 9,000 music videos and over 150 television programs to the U.S. market.  We are investing heavily in iPod and iTunes engineering and are very enthusiastic about our products in the pipeline. The iPod ecosystem continues to thrive with innovative new products, such as the Nike + iPod Sport Kit, which allows runners to get real-time feedback on their performance through their iPod Nanos.  It was another exciting quarter for the Apple retail stores. Fueled by very strong sales of MacBooks and MacBook Pros, the retail stores generated revenue of $715 million, representing 29% year-over-year growth. The stores generated $29 million in segment profit, excluding $148 million in associated manufacturing profit.  We opened 14 stores during the quarter, ending with 155. With an average of 146 stores open during the quarter, average quarterly revenue per store was $4.9 million.  Store traffic continued to be very strong, with over 17 million customers visiting our stores during the quarter. Based on the latest retail store survey, nearly 50% of customers buying Macs in our stores are new to the Mac.  One of the highlights of the quarter was the opening of our Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan. The store has quickly become our highest volume store, and we recently welcomed the store's 500,000th visitor. Customers are visiting the store in record numbers around the clock.  We were very pleased with our education business results, generating the highest quarterly revenue through our U.S. education channel in over 10 years, and shipping more Macs than in any other June quarter in the company's history. Our higher education customers have been extremely receptive of the MacBook and MacBook Pro, and our back-to-school promotion has already proven very popular with customers.  In terms of geographic results, including sales from our retail stores, quarterly revenue in the Americas, Europe and Japan was up 27%, 22% and 13% respectively. Gross margin was 30.3% on a GAAP basis, about 190 basis points higher than our guidance, primarily due to a very favorable component pricing environment, and secondarily due to a more favorable mix of direct Mac sales.  Included in GAAP cost of goods sold was $6 million in stock-based compensation expense. Excluding that expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 30.4%.  GAAP operating expenses were $759 million, including $31 million in expense related to stock-based compensation.  OI&E was $95 million, about $10 million higher than guidance, primarily due to higher-than-expected cash balances and higher-than-expected yields on cash investment.  The tax rate for the quarter was just under 29%. This differed from our previous tax rate guidance of about 32%, primarily due to a tax benefit reported for the implementation of tax planning strategy associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings under the American Jobs Creation Act that more than offset a tax charge reported for the repatriation. This resulted in a net benefit in the quarter of $24 million, or $0.03 per diluted share.  We had very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by $950 million, to end with about $9.2 billion. This was primarily a function of cash flow from operations of just over $1 billion.  Looking ahead to the September quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.  For the quarter, we are targeting revenue between $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash, stock-based compensation to be approximately $40 million. We expect GAAP gross margins to be about 28.4%, reflecting approximately $6 million related to stock-based compensation expense. Without that expense, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 28.5%. We expect GAAP op-ex to be about $785 million, including about $34 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect non-GAAP op-ex to be about $751 million. We expect OI&E to be about $100 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%. We expect to generate GAAP EPS of about $0.46 to $0.48, which includes an anticipated $0.03 per share related to non-cash, share-based compensation expense. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $0.49 to $0.51.  We are thrilled to have just reported the second-highest revenue and earnings in Apple's history and are very pleased with our Intel transition progress. We are also very excited about and confident in the products in our pipeline. With that, I would like to open the call to questions. \nOperator: Thank you.  (Operator Instructions)  We will go first to Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns. \nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: If you could talk, to the extent you can, about how you are viewing the balance of the year. In the press release, you talk about an exciting new pipeline of iPod products. There is a lot of concern, obviously, out there about what sort of plans you have. How important is it for you to hit the holiday season? Is that in your expectations as you look out at the balance of the year? How innovative can innovative be? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Andy, you know that we do not talk about unannounced products, so there is really a limit to what I can say. I will just tell you two things. The first is, we are very confident in the products in our pipeline and I just do not imagine that the creativity at Apple could ever be low. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Andy. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Shannon Cross with Cross Research. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Good afternoon. Just a question on your gross margin guidance and how you are going to position -- well, you cannot talk about that, so let's talk about gross margin guidance. It looks like there is a substantial decrease quarter over quarter relative to where you came in. Are we to assume more price aggressiveness and mix shift on the product side is driving that, or do you anticipate a big change in the commodity market environment? Also, if you can just talk about what you are seeing in commodities in general.\nPeter Oppenheimer: I will start generally, and Tim can provide some further color on the commodity environment. We expect the favorable commodity environment to continue, and have guided our non-GAAP gross margins at 28.5%, which is above our historical target range.  We expect the gross margin percent to decline sequentially, largely driven by a full quarter of the back-to-school promotion, lower international pricing from our June price reductions, and a different product mix, including more MacBooks, from the full quarter of availability. \nTim Cook: As Peter said earlier, the component pricing was very favorable in Q3. It was favorable across almost all categories. It was a great time to be a buyer.  In terms of the quarter that we are now in, Q4, and this is included in the guidance that Peter gave earlier, we expect that we will continue to have a favorable environment on NAND Flash, on flat-panel displays, on portable hard-drives, all of which -- those areas are places where supply exceeds demand, as in the broader industry. On the DRAM market, we expect it to be relatively balanced and for the prices to trade within a fairly narrow range. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Ben Reitzes with UBS. \nBenjamin Reitzes - UBS: Thank you. Could you talk, Peter and maybe Tim, about the economic environment, consumer versus education in particular? Maybe give us a view of what you are seeing out there in the economy, given some of the worries out there. \nPeter Oppenheimer: We will let Tim talk a little bit about some of our markets, and Gary then will give you a few thoughts on the economy. \nTim Cook: In terms of what we saw across the quarter, once we announced the MacBook and began shipping it, we saw a very robust consumer and higher education demand. In the pro markets, we were slow and we were slow because we believe that customers are delaying purchases, waiting on a PowerMac with an Intel chip in it, and in some cases waiting for applications, such as Adobe's Creative Suite.  The ed. market had a fabulous quarter. It was the best June quarter in 10 years, as Peter said earlier. We grew 11% year over year in the ed. market versus an IDC projection of the ed. market, which was shrinking by 4%. The higher ed. market, which is a subset of total ed. market, grew 31% year over year.  We had a very fabulous consumer and higher education market season. We believe that we are very well-poised going into the back-to-school season, with the MacBook being so well-received and also the promotion that we are running with the Nano. Gary? \nGary Whistler: I am going to speak a little bit more generally. From the data we have seen, the U.S. economy and the consumer are holding up pretty well in the face of all this stuff, the geopolitical uncertainty and the higher oil prices and energy prices and higher interest rates. That said, and most of you are aware fed Chairman Bernanke made a few comments this morning suggesting or intimating the economy and consumer was beginning to moderate a little. \nBenjamin Reitzes - UBS: I guess based on Tim's comments, you might not be seeing that yet. Just one last thing is, you came in above at least my expectations for iPods and Macs, but not in some of the other things, like other music, perhipherals and other. Granted the year-over-year\u2019s were decent on some of those, but was there anything holding those back? Was there anything in particular going on in other music or peripherals? I would have thought with more Mac sales that line might have done a little better sequentially. It looks like the quarter could have even been even more impressive, because I think the iPod/Macs overall were pretty good. Could you just comment there? \nPeter Oppenheimer: On the software side, the comparison there is to the launch quarter of Tiger a year ago, so it is very, very difficult to compare. Sequentially, we had iLife announced in Q2.  On the peripherals and other hardware category, we have integrated more and more things that were in peripherals before into the Macintosh itself and shipped it as part of the base configuration.  The other music related products and services piece, basically a 6% decline sequentially, tracked to the iPod itself. \nBenjamin Reitzes - UBS: Thanks a lot. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Keith Bachman with Banc of America. \nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: Thank you. I have a question on the retail side. There was some volatility between this quarter and last quarter in terms of both the units and revenues. I was just hoping you could speak to that a little bit, and I have a follow-up. Thanks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes, units, Keith, for Macs in retail were up 40% year over year. The response in the stores to both the MacBook and MacBook Pro was very, very strong. As I indicated, about half the Macs we sold were to people that had never owned a Mac before. \nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: Peter, just to be clear, was most of that delta, if you will, between the March quarter and the June quarter of units up 50% this quarter in total at retail, versus 7 last quarter? Was that disproportionately driven by the new Mac notebooks? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We had much more availability of our Intel-based Macs, yes. As we said in the last call in the March quarter, Ron really began to focus from January at Macworld on the Intel transition and we did not have products in January, in particular. With our having availability, not only of the MacBook Pro and Intel-based Mac but now the MacBook, he had just a fantastic quarter in the stores, not only with Mac sales but just sales in general. \nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: Peter, you mentioned what the average revenue was per store for the average store opened. Could you refresh us on what that was last quarter? Thanks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: I will have to follow up with you. I do not recall what last quarter was.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Keith. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Robert Semple with Credit Suisse. \nRobert Semple - Credit Suisse: Can you walk me through the revenue outlook? If you take the midpoint of it, I know it is similar to what you did last year, but last year you guys were taking down inventories on the iPod side, for I guess both the Nano and the eventual video launch. Historically, you have been up a little bit more seasonally than that in September. Can you just kind of walk me through the thought process there? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Our guidance for the September quarter actually is consistent with our past seasonality. Our range represents growth of 22% to 25% over last year. Again, last year, the last year September quarter was the best Mac sales quarter we had in education in 10 years.\nRobert Semple - Credit Suisse: Then just switching gears to iPod. I noticed ASP was off about $15 sequentially. Is that more of a mix issue, or was it because you started the kind of back-to-school free iPod with the Mac a little bit earlier than you did last year? \nPeter Oppenheimer: The main thing that drove that was the introduction in Q2 of the 1-gigabyte Nano for $149, and so in Q3 we had a full quarter at that. \nRobert Semple - Credit Suisse: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Rob. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Harry Blount, Lehman Brothers. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Peter, just in terms of Leopard, are you assuming any contribution from Leopard in the September quarter for the margins? \nPeter Oppenheimer: I am sorry -- for the September quarter? \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Yes. \nPeter Oppenheimer: We have not announced the ship dates for Leopard. Our Developers Conference begins on August 7 next month, and we look forward to talking about Leopard and showing you many of the new features. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: In terms of the retail performance, if I look at revenue per walk-in customer and revenue per store, I am looking at revenue per walk-in customer is down for the sixth consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. I am wondering if you have a sense as to why that might be. Also, on the same-store sales, we are also seeing that down year over year the last two quarters. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Traffic through the stores has just been phenomenal. We had over 17 million people come through the stores this past quarter. As I said in my prepared remarks, our Fifth Avenue store has seen over 500,000 people since it has been open in May.  The average store sales were down slightly year over year, but our total revenue from the stores is up about 29%. The average store revenue was down, a result of iPod sales being relatively flat year over year, as we have had a greatly-expanded channel, but our Mac sales continue to increase and we are up 50% year over year. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Peter, last thing on the housekeeping side of the equation, can you maybe give us a sense of how many distribution points you have for both the iPod and the Mac? Also, a rough sense as to how many of the Macs sold in the quarter were tied to the iPod promotion? Thank you. \nPeter Oppenheimer: On the iPod side, we have close to 40,000 distribution points, which is up slightly from the previous quarter, as we have added a few select resellers around the world. On the Macintosh, we have about 7,000 points of sale. We are conducting some pilots to potentially expand that, but we are not making any announcements today about that.  In terms of the promotion, we started back in the beginning of June, and so there were not a significant number of those within the quarter. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Great, thank you very much. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Harry. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Richard Farmer with Merrill Lynch. \nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Peter, I would like to ask a couple of questions on gross margins, please. In the past, you have commented, at least qualitatively, on the iPod hardware gross margin. I wonder if you can provide any color there on how much that might have changed sequentially and year over year.  The same question as it would relate to the Mac hardware in gross margin change. Finally, just a broader question on your philosophy in gross margin management longer-term. It seems like historically, you had been managing a little bit more to lower the prices or increase the feature set so that the gross margins were more stable, and that the upside in gross margins was quickly put back into price to stimulate growth. This quarter and some other recent data points, it seems like you are managing more for margin leverage. I understand the component cost had something to do with that, but if you look longer-term, are you making a decision here to manage the company more for margin leverage? Or should we think of you as investing a lot of that back into features and price so that the margin leverage we are seeing is more temporary? \nPeter Oppenheimer: In terms of product gross margins, we have a long-standing practice of not releasing specific gross margins, specific product gross margins. However, the iPod gross margin was up sequentially in the June quarter and that was really attributable to the very favorable commodity environment. The Mac products precipitated in that too.  Now, as regards our philosophy, I think that we are very competitive today, both on our Mac products and iPod. We will continue to be aggressive with both our pricing and our feature and function.  From a long-term perspective, we are not putting out a financial model, but I would target gross margin generally in the 27 to 28 some range. I've discussed with you in the past the factors that add and subtract to that. The primary positive factors include direct sales, where we retain the channel margin, as well as software and AppleCare and accessories. The primary adverse factors to gross margin are hardware, including iPod. \nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Richard. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Richard Gardner with Citigroup. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thank you. Just two quick questions. First of all, Tim, I was hoping you might be able to give us a sense of supply/demand balance on the MacBook exiting the quarter.  Secondly, also for Tim, does the fact that Intel rolls out new chips and drops prices more frequently than your prior processor partners create additional challenges for you on the inventory management front? Will you be rolling your products more frequently and adjusting your prices more frequently as the bill of materials comes down? Or will you do it the same way that you have done historically, which is adjust your prices at the time of new product introduction? Thank you. \nTim Cook: In regards to the MacBook, we shipped a significant number of MacBooks, particularly in the month of June. However, despite that, we did exit the quarter with some backlog. We are working very hard to fulfill that backlog during this quarter. For the full quarter, I do not envision having a supply issue that would negate that.  In terms of Intel, we are very pleased to be working with Intel. They have been a great partner for us. We feel that they have the best processor by far for us to use in the products that we both want to make and are currently shipping. Frankly, I am pleased that there are new products coming out there and that we can change over time.  As you know, we do not discuss unannounced products, so I really would not want to go into our philosophy about when we would roll with them and how we might change pricing. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest Securities. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities: Just a follow-up question on the iPod units -- what was the effect of the major and Mac promo being moved up in June? Was that significant to contributing to the iPod units for the quarter? \nTim Cook: It was not significant. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities: Then on the iPod ASPs, how should we be thinking about the blended ASPs going forward for the category? Should we be thinking that they should stay within the range that they have been the last few quarters? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, I am sorry. That is a question we cannot answer. We do not provide product level forecast. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities: Okay. On the direct versus indirect mix, could you give additional color on that as well? That\u2019s it, thanks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. In the quarter, our direct sales, which we define as sales through our retail stores, online stores directly to customers and the iTunes Music Store, were 50% in the June quarter, up from 44% in the March quarter. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Rebecca Runkle with Morgan Stanley. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon, two questions, first on retail distribution. Can you just confirm what pilots you are currently running and have underway and when approximately they began? I have a quick follow-up. \nTim Cook: Rebecca, the main one that we are running right now is with BestBuy. We are in a few of their stores, half of which have Apple people selling product and half of which do not. We are working with BestBuy to evaluate those results. We have been doing that for about two months. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: Nothing else currently underway? \nTim Cook: Not with a major partner. We have some select things that are of a smaller nature. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: Perfect. Then, Peter, if we were to go back and look at historical OS launches, will you give us some color in terms of the impact and trending that you saw in the business, perhaps look at it, the quarter before an OS release, what types of variations did you see in the business as a result? Then, during the quarter of the OS release, what types of trends did you see? \nPeter Oppenheimer: You mean for the OS sales itself? \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: Just in terms of how the OS has trended, but then also how it has impacted the overall business. I am trying to get to, holistically, how we should be thinking about historical OS releases and how they have impacted the business model, broadly speaking. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Okay. First of all, when we released Tiger in the June quarter a year ago, our revenues from Tiger in that quarter from shrink wrap and license sales, so not including any allocation for what would have been on a Mac, was $100 million in the quarter. Your first-quarter sales are always your best. We certainly think that Mac OS X is the best operating system. I think it is a part of, along with our design, our transition to Intel, our retail stores and other great channel partners, are why the Mac has been growing so well and we have been gaining share. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: Just to clarify, in the quarter before historical releases, did you typically see any slowdown in CPU sales in anticipation of the new OS? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, that is really hard to\u2026\nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: I know that is subjective.\nPeter Oppenheimer: \u2026to evaluate. The software sales are the best at the front end of a release, and over time they are still good. Our OS sales even in the June quarter were good, but they are not what they are in the first quarter of launch. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: Perfect, thanks so much. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Rebecca. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jonathan Hoopes with ThinkEquity. \nJonathan Hoopes - ThinkEquity: Thank you. Looking at the unit shipment levels between the Mac desktops and the notebooks, are we to understand then that the vergence was mainly a function of the pro community not having products there to upgrade into, or was it a function of the education? As we move forward into the September education period, do you expect desktops to regain some strength there?\nTim Cook: The main thing affecting desktops, frankly, are the compelling notebooks that we announced. So as the market is moving more notebook, Apple is leading the way and with the incredible announcement that we had with the MacBook Pro in Q2 and then the MacBook in Q3, there was just a very compelling reason to buy a laptop.  On the desktop side, the comparison there would be, on a pro business, is fairly slower than a year ago, as people await a PowerMac with an Intel chip and/or an application from a third-party developer.  The other thing that was happening was that the e-Mac was really at a close to an end-of-life last quarter, so sales on that were not as robust as they were a year ago. \nJonathan Hoopes - ThinkEquity: Thank you. Do you have an idea as to how long a pro user typically waits before they upgrade? Are they more of a wait-and-see, or do you believe you had a wait list for pro users on an intel refresh?\nTim Cook: I believe that pro users act like other users, and there is a time-standard deviation between different types of segments with them. I would not want to estimate what the average it is, or would be. \nJonathan Hoopes - ThinkEquity: Thank you very much. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Jonathan. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you. Just a follow-up on the last question, is there any way you could provide a percentage of desktops to the pro market, both in the June quarter of \u201906 and compare that to the June quarter of \u201905, just so we can get a feel as to the size of that market? Secondly, is there any way you could quantify the missed sales due to supply constraints on the MacBook business? Thank you. \nTim Cook: On the size of the market, we do not disclose size of market numbers. Frankly, it is very hard to conclude exactly what they are because we sell both directly and indirectly, so that would be very hard to do.  What was your second question?\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Hoping to get a quantification of the notebook upside missed due to supply constraints, on the size of the backlog. \nTim Cook: We did ship a significant amount in June. We left with some backlog, but we are continuing to ship, obviously in this month and view that that will not be an issue for the quarter. \nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities: To ask that first question a second way, can you provide us a percentage of shipments that were PowerMacs in each of those quarters?\nTim Cook: We release things at desktop and portable level. \nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Chris. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Bill Shope with JP Morgan.\nBill Shope - JP Morgan: Thank you. I believe last quarter, you know that you got more aggressive with the market efforts overseas for the iPod. Can you give us some comment on the progress you might have seen in this arena throughout the quarter?\nTim Cook: We did get more aggressive. We had put more energy outside the U.S. as we had the supply capability to do that. As a consequence, we saw share gains in several countries in Europe, including the U.K., Spain, Italy and France. We are very pleased with that.  Also, through the month of May, BCN has reported that we saw more of the 50% share in Japan as well, and so we appear to be making good progress. \nBill Shope - JP Morgan: One more question -- I am not sure if it is too early to ask this one yet, but have you been able to gather any data to help you understand if Bootcamp is actually stimulating Mac switchers?\nTim Cook: We released the Beta in April, the number of downloads that we have had are significant, and the customer feedback that we\u2019ve had on Bootcamp is very, very good. It is clear that for a Windows user that is considering switching to a Mac, that it makes it even more appealing to them to switch. \nBill Shope - JP Morgan: Great, thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Kevin Hunt with Thomas Weisel Partners\nKevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners: Thank you. I had a couple of additional follow-ups on the gross margin question. First of all, in the response to someone asking about why gross margin guidance was down 200 basis points, it sounded to me like you said everything was going to be the same as this quarter, so I guess I am still not clear why it would be down 200 basis points.  Secondly, in terms of the Intel transition on the Mac side, can you talk about what direct impact that might be having, moving to an Intel chip rather than your historical chips? Also, whether using the Intel chipsets essentially lowers any other kind of component cost that you use within the PC? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Again, the reason we are guiding gross margin down is we will see a full quarter impact of the back-to-school promotion. It was a very aggressive promotion, where with a purchase of a qualifying Mac and an iPod Nano, a customer can get a rebate for the iPod Nano. We lowered our international pricing towards the end of the quarter as a result of a weakening in the dollar. We expect a different product mix, including more MacBooks, from having a full quarter of availability.  I do not think we have really any comments on our Intel-based product gross margins. \nKevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners: Is that a positive factor or a negative factor? Can you at least say that? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Again, we do not have a comment. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Kevin. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Charles Wolf with Needham & Company. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Yes, I have a question about the music model. I was wondering if the actions of some European countries, most notably France, pose any threat to Apple's music model. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Charlie, we believe that any legislation that requires the sharing of DRMs will result in state-sponsored piracy, which we think will cause artists to disallow their works to be sold digitally just as the market is beginning to grow. We hope that the countries will let the extremely competitive marketplace, driven by consumer choice, decide which players and online music stores are offered to customers. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Yes, I have one quick follow-up. Will there be any surprises at the Developers Conference? \nPeter Oppenheimer: You will have to come and attend. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Charlie. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Shaw Wu with American Technology Research. \nShaw Wu - American Technology Research: Thank you. Just some questions on your Japan business. It was down sequentially, double-digit for the second quarter in a row, but up on a year-over-year basis. I am just wondering, is Japan performing up to your expectations? Then, just some comments on the executive departure there. Thanks. \nTim Cook: In the PC market in Japan, sequentially the market is generally down 15% or so, so the sequential performance is not surprising. In addition to that, we took some number of units out of the channel in iPod.  On a year-over-year basis, if you look at Japan and you combine it with our retail stores that are in Japan, we were up 13%. That 13% is lower than the company average of 24, and we are not happy about that. We are continuing to look for and seek improvements in the business in Japan. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Regarding the change, Shaw, we mutually agreed on his resignation, which has already occurred. Our Japan marketing team will continue to report directly to Phil Schiller in Cupertino, and Phil will take the interim position to lead our overall marketing in Japan. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Shaw. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Mr. Munster, your line is open. Please go ahead. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon. A couple of international questions. First, if you look at the success you had in the U.S., it really has not rolled out internationally. I think you went over some of the growth rates, and it seemed a little bit less in Europe and Asia. What is the big issue? Is it just a price point issue? Maybe you can address if you think about expanding the Apple brand globally, and a follow-up question. \nTim Cook: Gene, if you look at Europe as an example, Europe\u2019s revenue was up 21% year over year; that compares to the company average of 24%. If you combine it with the retail segment, or the groups, the stores that we have in Europe, it was up 22% compared to the company average of 24%. So Europe is very close.  When we deploy a new product, and in this case, we deployed MacBook, as you know, it takes longer to deploy a new product into Europe than it does the U.S. In the first quarter, generally speaking, Europe would get less advantage of a new product. I think that is the primary difference in the growth rate in Europe. Japan we just spoke about. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: What about even markets, like the markets that are not talked much about, like South America and Central America and things like this? You just do not seem to really have much of a footprint at all, and these are obviously big markets. \nTim Cook: The growth rate that we had in Latin America last quarter was tremendous. It almost doubled. However, we can always improve in the absolute level of revenue in that area and we are focused on doing that. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray:\nTim Cook: We do not release iPod shipments on a geographic basis. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Can you address if some of the legislative issues in France, or potentially some of the things going on with Sony Ericsson and some of their new products, are you seeing an impact from any of those? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, I have not seen an impact from the Sony products that I can comment on. As I said, I answered this for Charlie, but we just think and hope that the governments will let the extremely competitive marketplace, driven by customer choice, decide which players and which online music stores are offered to consumers. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: But it is safe to say that you have not seen an impact from either of those, to the best of your knowledge, Peter? \nPeter Oppenheimer: I have not looked specifically at Sony, so I do not want to comment on that. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. I guess just conceptually, some of the things that Sony is doing, what are your thoughts on that? Obviously, it had tremendous growth with the Sony Walkman phone. When you guys step back and see some of that success, what do you even think about? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, we are very confident in our ability to compete in the marketplace, and we are very excited about what we have in the product pipeline. You know that I cannot comment on that.  As regards cell phones, we do not think that the phones that are available today make the best music players. We think the iPod is. But over time, that is likely to change, and we are not sitting around doing nothing. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Great, thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. Similar to what you have done on the Mac side, have you done any studies on what percentage of iPod sales are to existing owners? To go along with that, what are you doing to drive sales into your install base between product cycles? \nPeter Oppenheimer: I am not aware of studies or data that we have in that regard, David. In terms of what are we doing -- great marketing, offering great points of presence around the world, both in our retail stores and online and through our channel partners, and offering customers what we think is the absolute best products in the marketplace, in not only the iPod but the iTunes Music Store. I think the market share that we command around the world supports that. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, David. Could we have the next question please? \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Steve Lidberg with Pacific Crest Securities. \nSteve Lidberg - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you. First, with regard to the MacBook, it seemed like you had shipments relatively within equilibrium exiting the June quarter in terms of supply. Relative to the online store, now you are showing a wait time of five to seven days. Can you give some insight into what that is related to?  Then, as an additional question, Peter, with regard to the last couple of your quarters, you stated and highlighted the strength in the product pipeline, yet really from a product introduction standpoint, what we have seen has been relatively well-anticipated, i.e., the Intel transition devices. Is there some challenges on the execution side of the R&D pipeline? How should we think about that? \nPeter Oppenheimer: I have high confidence in the team here at Apple. We remain very confident in and excited about the products in our pipeline, and look forward to the future. \nTim Cook: Steve, on MacBook, we are working very hard to fill our backorders on MacBook. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Steve, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time. for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer, and he'll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Apple treasurer Gary Whistler for the Q&A session with analysts. Apple's second quarter spans 13 weeks compared to the 14 weeks spanned by our first quarter this year. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, earnings per share, Apple's retail initiatives, demand for Macintosh computers, future products, including Intel-based Macs, and non-cash stock based compensation expense. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2005, as well as the Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter. Please also note that any non-GAAP financial measures included in today's call should be viewed in addition to and not in lieu of Apple's GAAP results. A reconciliation of any GAAP and non-GAAP measures discussed will be posted on Apple's website at www.apple.com/investor. In connection with SEC rules on corporate disclosure, Apple is making this analyst call open to the media and general public by broadcasting the call live over the Internet. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report March quarter results that exceeded our guidance for both revenues and earnings. The quarter's revenue of $4.36 billion was the second highest in Apple's history, topped only by our record December quarter results, and grew 34% year over year. These results were driven by continued strong growth in our music business and solid performance in our Mac business during the transition to Intel. Operating margin for the quarter was 12.1%, and net income was $410 million, or $0.47 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of $42 million in non-cash, stock based compensation expense, operating margin was 13.1%, net income was $440 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.50. The quarter's non-GAAP operating margin was the second-best ever for Apple and demonstrates the leverage in our business model. I'd like to first talk about our Mac business, which represented 50% of our total quarterly revenue, an increase 7% year over year. Mac units were up 4% year over year to 1.11 million, and ending channel inventory was within our target range of 4 to five weeks. We continue to be very happy with our progress in the Intel transition. We have introduced the MacBook Pro, new iMac, and new Mac-Mini with Intel processors, and we are solidly on track to have the entire Mac product line transitioned by the end of this calendar year. In January, we indicated that we have seen a pause in customer demand in the December quarter as customers began to anticipate the introduction of the Intel Mac, and we said that we were factoring the transition into our guidance for the March quarter. As we anticipated, this pause was even more evident during the March quarter, and was generally observed in three areas. First, we announced the MacBook Pro at MacWorld and began to ship in late February, which limited the number of shipping weeks in the quarter. Second, we observed purchasing delays as some customers are waiting for the remainder of our product announcements. Third, while developer progress on universal applications has been excellent, we believe some customers are delaying purchasing until certain universal applications are available. Customer and industry analyst feedback on the new Intel-based products has been very positive, and we're very enthusiastic about the additional Intel-based Macs that we will be introducing this year. We have released universal versions of Apple software, including iLife, iWork, QuickTime, Final Cut Studio, Aperture, and Logic. Our third-party developers are making excellent progress with our transitions as well, with over 1,500 universal applications currently available, and commitments from key developers such as Adobe and Microsoft. Our Music business posted another quarter of very strong results, representing 50% of total company revenue and increasing 79% year over year. iPod shipments grew 61% year over year, and we\u2019ve cumulatively shipped over 50 million. We exited the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks for iPod channel inventory. Other music product revenue was $485 million, up 125% year over year, and about flat sequentially with 14-week holiday quarter. These results were a function of continued strong sales from the iTunes music store, the introduction of the iPod hi-fi, and very solid demand for other iPod accessory products. The iTunes music store sold its one-billionth song during the March quarter. According to the most recent data from Nielsen Soundscan, the iTunes Music Store counts for 87% share of the market for legally purchased and downloaded music in the United States. The music store's U.S. content has continued to expand impressively, and now includes over 2.9 million songs, 60,000 pod casts, 9,000 music videos, and over 70 television programs from ABC, NBC, CBS, HBO, ESPN and Showtime. We remain extremely enthusiastic about Apple's music business. Despite a large field of competitors, the most recently published data from NPD Tech World shows that Apple's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players has increased in March to 78% from 71% in December. The iPod Ecosystem continues to thrive, with over 2,000 iPod accessories currently available. There is increasing interest from the automotive industry, and we estimate that 40% of new cars sold in the U.S. this year will offer direct iPod integration. Looking outside the U.S., the iPod is also the top selling MP3 player by a wide margin in the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, and Canada based on the latest data from GFK and BCN. In the rest of Europe and Asia, we do not enjoy the same level of market share and we view this as an opportunity. We are optimistic about further market penetration potential globally and our ability to grow international market share. Considering penetration rates of other consumer electronic products, the MP3 player market has a lot of room for growth. According to Forrester Research, U.S. household MP3 player penetration was less than one-quarter that of digital still cameras as of the end of 2005. Turning to Apple's retail segment, revenue from the Apple retail stores totaled $636 million for the quarter, reflecting the transition to Intel and broader indirect iPod distribution. The new-to-Mac percentage increased to 50% of Macs sold in the store's most recent survey. We opened six new stores during the quarter, exiting with 141. With an average of 138 stores opened during the quarter, average quarterly revenue per store was $4.6 million. Retail segment profit was $29 million, compared to $42 million in the year ago quarter, and the associated manufacturing margin not reflected in the retail segment profit was $128 million compared to the $102 million in the year ago quarter. Traffic through our retail stores continued to be strong during the quarter, growing from 13 million visitors to 18.1 million visitors year over year, and translating to over 10,000 visitors per store per week. Customer interest in the new Creative Studios was high during the quarter, and we staffed up to deliver over 50,000 one-to-one personal training sessions. We will continue to add new stores at a measured pace and expect to open a total of 40 new stores during fiscal '06. In terms of geographic results, including sales from our retail stores, quarterly revenue in the Americas, Europe, and Japan was up 38%, 37%, and 8% respectively. Gross margin was 29.8% on a GAAP basis, about 200 basis points higher than our guidance, primarily due to a favorable component pricing environment, higher-than-expected software sales, and lower-than-expected costs associated with the Intel transition. Included in GAAP costs of goods sold was $5 million in stock-based compensation expense. Excluding that expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 29.9%. GAAP operating expenses were $768 million, including $37 million in expense related to stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP OpEx was $731 million, in line with our guidance. OI&E was $76 million and the tax rate was 32%. We used some of the cash to make several investments during the quarter. First, we made the remaining $500 million prepayments relating to the agreements for future supply of NAND Flash memory components that we announced in the December quarter. Second, we net share settled executive income tax obligations from vesting of restricted shares and share units by purchasing and canceling about 5.5 million shares for $353 million. Third, we spent about $120 million to acquire a new data center in the first of several properties to form a second Cupertino campus. Fourth, we made other capital expenditures of $73 million, including $42 million for our retail initiative. Despite these significant investments, cash declined by just $481 million during the quarter to $8.23 billion due to strong earnings, excellent working capital management and stock option exercises. Looking ahead to the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. For the quarter, we are targeting revenue between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion. We are factoring into our guidance a continued pause in demand in the Mac business related to the transition to Intel. We are also factoring in lower ASPs for Macs and iPods, due to the beginning of the education buying season, and for the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle price reductions and the introduction of the one gigabyte Nano. We expect total quarterly costs of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately $50 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to be about 28.4%, reflecting approximately $5 million related to stock-based compensation expense. Without that expense, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be about 28.5%. We expect GAAP OpEx to be $775 million, including about $45 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect non-GAAP OpEx to be about $730 million, similar to the March quarter. We expect OI&E to be about $85 million, and we expect the tax rate to be 32%. We expect to generate GAAP EPS of about $0.39 to $0.43, which includes an anticipated $0.04 per share related to non-cash share-based compensation expense. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $0.43 to $0.47. Through the first half of fiscal 2006, Apple has generated over $10 billion in revenue and almost $1 billion in net income. We are very proud to have delivered strong revenue in earnings growth during the transition to Intel. We are extremely happy with how well the transition has been going, and we are very enthusiastic about all aspects of our music business. We are confident that our strategy of investing in product innovation is working, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Could we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Yes. If you\u2019d like to ask a question at this time, it is star 1 on your touch-tone telephone. We\u2019ll take our first question from Richard Chu of Cohen. Please go ahead.\nRichard Chu - SG Cowen & Co.: Hi, can you hear me?\nNancy Paxton: We can.\nRichard Chu - SG Cowen & Co.: Okay. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the gross margin variances. You alluded to component pricing. Can you comment on the impact of the purchases of components, either benefiting you or hurting you on that point? And then, second, was mix between systems and iPods a factor at all in the gross margin performance? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Richard, yeah, on the component point of view, we were able to secure lower costs than we had planned for the quarter, particularly on LCD\u2019s and Flash memory, and this helped drive the gross margins that Peter talked about in the preamble.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Richard, in terms of the second part of your question, there were really three factors, as I indicated, that helped us do better on the gross margin. The commodity environment, as Tim alluded to. Also, our software sales were better than we expected, particularly with the new iLife and iWork applications that we introduced at MacWorld. And in our guidance, we contemplated price reductions on some of our transitioning PowerPC products, which we largely didn\u2019t need to incur.\nRichard Chu - SG Cowen & Co.: So mix between iPod and systems was not a variance?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Not a primary one, no.\nRichard Chu - SG Cowen & Co.: Okay, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Richard. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Next we\u2019ll go to Ben Reitzes of UBS.\n Ben Reitzes - UBS : Yeah, good afternoon, thanks. Could you just characterize what\u2019s going on with iPod demand? Obviously 8.5 is a big drop-off from the 14.1, and obviously there\u2019s seasonality, there were some things with the extra week. Maybe you could go back in time as well and talk about what the extra week might have, in hindsight, now given you in iPods, and then how iPods are going out of the quarter. And then, to make this question longer, it seems that based on the ASP there was a drop-off in Nanos, a little more than expected, so could you just characterize the state of iPod demand?\nTim Cook: Overall, Ben, we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter. We shipped 8.5 million iPods and it was up over 60% year over year. The December quarter included a 14th week, and that week fell between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, and was one of the better shopping weeks of the year. And so that week sell-through was certainly better than the average of the quarter. And as we discussed in January, we also increased the channel inventory by about 550,000 iPods. So when you take these factors into account, the sequential iPod sales were down much less than 40% which, according to NPD Techworld, has been the typical sequential CE unit decline that you've seen from December to March. So I think the state of the iPods, we're very, very happy with it, with the results that we had this quarter, and are excited about what we have in the product pipeline.\n Ben Reitzes - UBS : What is in your guidance for iPods, and maybe more on guidance? You're basically flattish in revenue, but yet you should do better in Mac\u2019s because you may have more units. If you could just characterize some of the puts and takes between iPods and Mac\u2019s that went into that guidance.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Okay, well, as you know, we don\u2019t give product level guidance, but as I indicated in my prepared remarks, we are factoring into the guidance a continued pause in demand from the transition to Intel, and included in that is our thinking that some customers may wait for unannounced products and certain applications becoming universal. And we\u2019ve also factored the lower ASP\u2019s into the guidance, both for the Mac and iPod, as we enter the education buying season, and incur the fourth quarter impact of the shuffle price decrease and the introduction of the 1GB Nano.\n Ben Reitzes - UBS : Okay, and lastly, before I go back into the queue, is retail, you seem to be below expectations. Was there some kind of dynamic there where people were buying online and because of all the pre-orders of Mac\u2019s, or some kind of dynamic there that held retail sales down?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, our retail stores were really focusing on the transition to Intel, and given our Intel announcement that we made at MacWorld with later delivery, particularly with the MacBook Pro, you know, this limited the number of shipping weeks in the quarter. And this, combined with the overall pause that we observed impacted the quarter. And you know, I\u2019ll just add a little color to that. The retail stores have really been focused on the transition to Intel, and immediately upon our announcement at MacWorld, we changed all the product merchandise and the window displays and graphics in the store, really to communicate that this was the future. As Intel-based Mac\u2019s arrived in the stores, we stopped carrying the comparable PowerPC models, and as you may have seen, our retail sales teams were not discouraged from telling customers to wait for Intel-based Mac\u2019s if that was the best thing for the customer.\n Ben Reitzes - UBS : Okay, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Next we\u2019ll go to Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Yeah, good afternoon, everybody. Just I guess in terms of the iPod market share, could you give us just some color, what was domestic versus what was international?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. We have some data, we have some JFK and some BCN, and NPD. As I indicated, the March NPD data just came out this morning, and we were thrilled. Our market share increased to 78% from 71% in the December quarter. We don\u2019t have March data yet, internationally, but we do have some February data. Our market share increased in each of these markets from December to February. In the U.K., we were at 40%; Japan was 54%, Canada was 45%, and Australia was 58%.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, and I guess on that note, what percentage of your iPod sales are domestic versus international?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, that\u2019s something that we just don\u2019t discuss because we don\u2019t want to help our competitors.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, well, I guess it\u2019s safe to say that if you look at some of those other geographies, you have definitely a much lower market share, as you\u2019ve said, and you mentioned in your prepared comments about global expansion with the iPod, which sounds nice, but maybe you could talk a little bit about how you\u2019re actually going to do that.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Okay. I\u2019ll make some comments and Tim may want to add on. If you look outside some of the international countries that I referenced, such as Italy and Spain and Eastern Europe, and even China and Korea, our market share is much less than what I referenced in those five countries. And we are focused on increasing share by increasing our local advertising and point of distribution. We\u2019ve seen some success there. For example, since December in Germany, our share has improved by 10 points, up to 21%.; and in France, we gained four points up to 11%.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, so it\u2019s more directly related to advertising versus the pricing of the iPod?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I think it\u2019s many things -- our great product lineup, our distribution, the advertising we\u2019re doing, the Music Store.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: On another topic here, in terms of the Mac business, I was a little bit surprised to see that the pricing of the Mac mini increased, and granted, you\u2019ve built in a lot more functionality, but I would\u2019ve thought that maybe you guys would\u2019ve taken advantage of some of those price advantage with the Intel platform and try to pass along to pick up market share, but it seems like you\u2019re going in a little bit different direction. Is it safe to say you\u2019re going to kind of continue in the same direction you\u2019re going in terms of the pricing, or is every day a new day in terms of potentially where you could go with your pricing?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, I don\u2019t want to comment on our future pricing plan, but I would make a point that we view the Mac mini as an incredible value. With Mac mini, we began to ship front row for the first time on the Mac mini. It also is the lowest-priced way to get into the iLife suite. So overall, we think it\u2019s a great value for customers.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, but is it safe to say that your general thinking about pricing be consistent in the future or do you think it potentially could change? Any thoughts on that front?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I\u2019m not going to project our future pricing.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, one more, just a housekeeping item here. When there\u2019s some controversy when the actual back-to-school buying season starts. Is it in May through end of September? Could you just give us some color on that?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We generally begin to see some uplift in late June, but it\u2019s principally in July through September.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, so I know you guys aren\u2019t going to announce timing of products but, for example, the iBook, when would that have to be out? And again, this is not about the exact timing, but when would that have to be out to basically really hit the sweet spot of the back-to-school?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We\u2019re not going to comment on unannounced products.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, but any comments in terms of what the best window for getting the iBook out would be?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Again, I\u2019m not going to comment on an unannounced product.\nOperator: Thank you, Sir. We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Gardiner of Citigroup.\nRichard Gardiner - Citigroup: Okay, thank you. Tim, one for you. I was hoping maybe you could comment on the supply/demand balance for the new Intel-based products that you've launched so far this year, exiting the quarter. And then I guess for Peter, I know we've been talking about seasonality in your guidance for the June quarter throughout the call, but can you just give us a sense of what you consider to be normal seasonality for both the Mac and the music businesses going into June, excluding some of the product transition and other, I guess unusual, things that you might have going on? Thanks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Rich, how about if I start and then Tim can answer your first question.\nRichard Gardiner - Citigroup: Okay.\nPeter Oppenheimer: For the iPod, past seasonal trends are really not applicable this year as prior years\u2019 supply constraints, particularly with the iPod Mini, so we\u2019re not sure that we have good historical data points to reference. For the Mac, past seasonal trends other than the beginning of the education buying season are also likely to not be as appropriate, given our transition to Intel.\nTim Cook: Rich, on the three different products that we announced during the quarter that have Intel processors, the iMac was in reasonable supply the entire quarter. The MacBook Pro, the shipments of the MacBook Pro accelerated in March. February shipments were relatively low. In March, the last two weeks of the quarter were particularly strong, and with those strong shipments, which included a significant amount of units that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we reduced our backlog to normal levels. You know, I would stress again the number of weeks that it was shipping, obviously, were limited for the quarter. On the Mac mini, we announced that at the end of February and were able to ship that for four weeks of the quarter.\nRichard Gardiner - Citigroup: Okay, and if I could just follow up with one more question. Peter, could you just give us a sense of what the geographic mix is going to be of the 40 new retail stores that you\u2019re opening this year?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Primarily in the U.S.\nRichard Gardiner - Citigroup: Any sense of how many international are included in that?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I think a little more than 30 will be in the United States.\nRichard Gardiner - Citigroup: Okay. All right, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes, we\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Fearnley of FTN Midwest Securities.\n Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities : Yes, thanks, guys. I'd like to take another crack at the iBook question. With the current product with the G4 processor, do you see having that as your offering going to the K-12 education institutions, you know, the selling season or the pre-selling season for delivery in July through September? Do you think that's going to hurt you in the education business? Or do you think you'll be able to sell some of the G4 processors into the education institutions? And then I have a follow-up.\nPeter Oppenheimer:\n Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities : Do you think you\u2019d have to take any pricing actions on it though, to make it more attractive to institutions for later delivery?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Again, I\u2019m not going to comment on pricing or unannounced products.\n Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities : Okay, thanks. And also, I wanted to ask about iPod gross margins. You commented that they were above 20% last call. Could you update on what iPod gross margins were here for the second quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yeah, they were about 20% in the March quarter.\n Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities : And any comments on mix, Nano versus Video iPod, or anything that you care to comment on for additional color in the iPod space?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Nothing specifically. We were pleased with sales of all of our iPods.\n Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities : Okay, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes. (Operator Instructions). Our next question will come from Chris Whitmore of Deutche Bank.\nChris Whitmore - Deutche Bank: I was hoping to get some color on the split between iBook and MacBook Pro\u2019s during the quarter in terms of units sold. And in addition, in terms of the inventory levels and the channel, is there any significant difference between desktop inventory in the channel and notebook inventories in the channel?\nTim Cook: Chris, I won\u2019t break out the desktop versus portable channel inventory, but I will make some comments about channel inventory on the Mac overall. We ended the quarter, as Peter spoke about in the preamble, within the targeted range of four to five weeks. If you recall, we began the quarter with less than four weeks in preparation for the MacWorld announcement. We were able to return to that targeted range by the end of the quarter by increasing the amount of inventory by about five days --- and keep in mind that inventory is in support of indirect sales only.\nChris Whitmore - Deutche Bank: And the split between\u2026\nTim Cook: We don\u2019t split it out.\nChris Whitmore - Deutche Bank: Separate topic regarding Flash pricing. Flash pricing\u2019s coming off fairly sharply here, clearly helps your gross margins in the quarter. What are your thoughts about passing some of those price declines on to customers and accelerating unit growth? Any color on that would be helpful.\nTim Cook: We were able to benefit from Flash pricing in the quarter. We did take, if you recall, the Shuffle price down, the entry point, to $69. We also cut the price of the 1GB Shuffle to $99, and we announced a new entry point for the Nano at $149. We think all of those are an incredible value.\nChris Whitmore - Deutche Bank: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Chris. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Rebecca Runkle of Morgan Stanley.\n Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley : Hi, just a couple of quick questions. First, Peter, on iTunes in particular, I believe you've seen seasonality in the second quarter as school let's out in the past. Could you just refresh my own memory in terms of what specifically you've seen in the past?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I\u2019m sorry, for iTunes?\n Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley : Yes, and just music downloads.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, let me really make some comments. I think more between December and March, and see what happens in June and report to you. We were thrilled with our other music sales in the quarter, which were up 125% year over year. As you know, it primarily consists of the iTunes music store sales and our iPod and music accessories. Music sales were actually higher in the March quarter than they were in the December quarter, really showing the momentum that we have in the music store around the world. In terms of what we might expect for June, again we don't give specific product guidance, but we think we are continuing to gain momentum, and sales will vary also quarter by quarter, in part due to new releases.\n Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley : Just shifting gears, can you just talk about how and what type of CPU trends you saw as the new Intel CPU\u2019s became more available, and whether or not you saw people come back into the stores as the supply improved?\nTim Cook: Rebecca, it\u2019s Tim. Shipments of the Intel-based Mac\u2019s accelerated across the quarter, and the majority of the shipments that we did in the month of March were Intel-based. I think, just to pause there, it\u2019s an incredible accomplishment I think to announce a transition in January and have that occur just 60 days thereafter. The customer response that we've gotten is enormous. The analyst response is enormous. And as we thought, if you look at the adoption rate of percentage of Intel-based units sold to total units, the consumer segment was the highest adoption, and you know, the store's clearly saw that in the month of March.\n Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley : And then on boot camp in particular, any color that you can provide in terms of impact that you saw post that announcement?\nTim Cook: The response has been written about a lot. We did this because we were getting a lot of customer requests for this, as many Windows users were considering switching to the Mac. We think that it makes the Mac even more appealing to them, but it is beta, and so we put that out there to get feedback. We've really just begun that. It's only been out two weeks.\n Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley : But you would say that just in terms of what you saw from consumers and what you saw flowing to the store, what have you, that it was consistent with what we've seen written about from third parties?\nTim Cook: We\u2019re seeing a high level of interest in it.\n Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley : Right. Thank you both very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rebecca. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charles Wolf of Needham & Company.\n Charles Wolf - Needham & Company : Yes, I want to stay with boot camp. Will Apple add Windows virtualization to the final release in Leopard, or will you leave virtualization to the third parties, such as Parallel?\nTim Cook: Charlie, we just put it out. It's the beta. We will incorporate it in Leopard as we talked about, but the purpose of a beta is to get feedback, and I wouldn't want to speculate about what we would or would not do.\n Charles Wolf - Needham & Company : Okay, now has the Beta downloads in the past two weeks been substantial?\nTim Cook: There is a high level of interest, but again, it\u2019s a beta and we\u2019re not releasing the download numbers.\n Charles Wolf - Needham & Company : Okay, thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Charlie. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Keith Bachman of Banc of America. Mr. Bachman, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks very much. Peter, Tim, I wanted to go back for a second to the desktop number, if I could. The desktop was out for a good part of the quarter, and as you mentioned in the December quarter, there was a little bit of a pause there in anticipation of the new Intel system. Why do you think the number was still a bit slow? Are you alluding to the software availability as one of the negating factors there? And I have a follow-up, please.\nTim Cook: Keith, when you look at desktops, keep in mind that iMac, Mac Mini, eMac and Power Mac, and as you know, we don't release the specific units on each one of those, but I would share with you that the Intel-based iMac did very well in the quarter. The Mac mini only shipped for four weeks of the quarter, or the Intel version of the Mac mini that we began shipping in March. And the compare there is to the launch quarter of a year ago, so it's a very difficult compare. Also, as Peter alluded to in the preamble, we believe that certain Pro customers are delaying their purchase waiting on certain apps, and the Power Mac would clearly be the unit that would be most affected by the Pro customer delay.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: Tim, would it also be the high end of the iMac, and if Adobe has publicly indicated that they're not going to have their versions ready on natively until '07, how should we be thinking about that impacting? In other words, when do you think the pause ends?\nTim Cook: Well, Adobe has said that their application will be universal with the next release. Casual users of PhotoShop may be satisfied with using PhotoShop with Rosetta. A heavy user of PhotoShop would likely not be satisfied with the performance of Photoshop running under Rosetta. Frankly, it's very hard to assess the specific impact of it, but we do believe that this is affecting Mac sales, and we're working very closely with Adobe to get the creative suite out as soon as possible.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: Let me try one last one and then I'll cede the floor. You've indicated you think you might have some additional pause in June -- and clearly with the Mac or the iBook pending, that makes sense -- but would that in your mind be the end of any kind of pause at the June quarter?\nTim Cook: I don't want to predict beyond the current quarter, and yet we\u2019ve given guidance for the current quarter. We are very focused on what we believe are the key factors in getting through the transition, and those are: one, getting all of our hardware moved, and we are on target to do that by the end of the year, as Steve reported earlier at MacWorld; number two, to get our apps universal and we\u2019re pleased to report that the predominant apps in video and audio and our consumer apps are forwarded as of the end of March; number three is working with our developers, and as Peter said earlier, we've had 1500 that are already universal. And 50% of the top 500 will be by the end of April. And so we feel that this progress in less than 90 days is enormous progress, but I'm not going to predict when we will get through all of that, other than to say we\u2019re on target on the hardware schedule that we had announced earlier.\nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Thanks very much for taking my question.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Keith. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Richard Farmer of Merrill Lynch.\nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Three questions, please. Peter, I\u2019ll take another crack at the iPod hardware gross margin. You've said that it was over 20%. There are a lot of potential numbers above 20. Can you provide any more color there? Was it, for instance, closer to 25 than 20?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Richard, I think the only color that I will go into is that it was sequentially better in the March quarter from December, and above 20%. As we've indicated before, our competitors would just love to know what our specific gross margins are, and shipments by product and by geography, and we just don't want to help them.\nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Okay. I have two other brief ones, please. If you look at the observed price declines in the Flash contract market, how big of a lag is there typically between those declines and then Apple's ability to take advantage of that pricing in margin in the iPod product?\nTim Cook: We don't really talk about the specifics of our commercial deals, but I would tell you that the advantage that we got on Flash pricing during last quarter was one of the keys behind our gross margin meeting the guidance.\nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Okay, and finally a follow-up on boot camp. It seems pretty intuitive that there's going to be a portion of consumers that will switch to Mac as a result of the boot camp. Corporate, in the entrenched Windows environment, seems a little bit different. Do you think that boot camp is in any way going to give you an entr\u00e9e into the traditional corporate Windows environment, particularly if you're not supporting Windows? I guess the related question is, do you anticipate ever supporting Windows directly?\nTim Cook: We have no desire and no plan to sell or support Windows, but we do think that boot camp makes the Mac even more appealing to Windows users considering making the switch, and that's the reason we put it out. And it is a beta and so we have put it out to get feedback, and we\u2019re just two weeks into that.\nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Would you agree that's primarily a consumer-oriented addressable market then, that you're really not targeting, given no desire to support Windows directly, you're really not targeting any large corporate Windows environment?\nTim Cook: One of the great advantages of the beta is gathering the customers' feedback, and that's where we are in this process.\nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Richard. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Kevin Hunt of Thomas Weisel Partners.\n Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners.: Thanks. I have a couple of things. On a technical detail, can you give us the breakout of the $37 million stock option between R&D and SG&A? And also, I have some questions on the margins. This was your highest gross margin in like five years, and now you've been two quarters in a row over 13% operating margin, which I don't think you were in that high in multiple decades. Can you maybe update us on what the long-term model is that you think you can achieve on a gross margin and operating margin?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. I do not have the breakout with me for the stock comp expense between R&D and SG&A. We did include that last quarter in our press release financials, so you can go and look last quarter and get some indication of what it was then. In terms of our margin, I\u2019ve provided you very detailed guidance for the June quarter and we're not going to provide an updated business model or future projections, and pleased with the guidance that we've given you this quarter, which includes double-digit operating margin.\n Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners.: Okay, but I think a while a go you did kind of give some margin which I thought was only around 10% or so. So is that what you're saying for the long-term sustainable is, or are you saying I think it comes out to something like 11.5 or so, what you\u2019re saying for the next quarter.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, you can clearly see what we\u2019ve reported, and in terms of our guidance on a GAAP basis, including the stock comp expense, we are at 10% plus, and without the stock for the guidance that we provided for the June quarter is over 11%.\n Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners.: Okay, one last question. Did you have any significant discounting of the older G4 models in the quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: No, and that was one of the three factors that allowed us to do better on gross margin than what we had guided to. We had planned for some price reductions and many of the transitioning PowerPC models, and used very little of it.\n Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel Partners.: Okay, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Kevin. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Shope of JP Morgan.\nBill Shope - JP Morgan: Great, thank you. Could you give us your outlook for the component prices in the June quarter, and are any components currently constrained?\nTim Cook: There's no significant constraint in the market that we're experiencing. Factored into the guidance that Peter gave you is a favorable pricing environment for both LCD and NAND Flash, where supply continues to exceed the demand. We expect optical drives and hard drives to track to historical trends, and DRAM pricing, we expect to trade in a relatively narrow range.\nBill Shope - JP Morgan: Okay, and one more question. There\u2019s been a lot of press on the DRM law proposals in France. Can you give us a read on what you view the potential risks are here to the Apple business model longer term, and whether you think there is a risk that this could spread to other countries?\nTim Cook: Well, we believe that the French implementation of the EU copyright directive will result in state-sponsored piracy, and if this happens, we believe legal music sales will plummet just when legitimate alternatives to piracy are winning customers over. We don't think that the proposed French legislation would be good for anyone.\nBill Shope - JP Morgan: Okay, and then final question, can you give us an update on the profitability of the Music Store?\nTim Cook: The Music Store operated above break even in the March quarter.\nBill Shope - JP Morgan: Great, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Andy Neff of Bear Stearns.\nBill Hand - Bear Stearns: Thank you. It's Bill Hand for Andy. Just a couple questions. On the iPod front, I know you can't talk about new products, but any thoughts on potential new directions and future drivers for iPod in the second half, other than perhaps maybe market-share gains internationally?\nTim Cook: Well, it\u2019s a question that I\u2019m really not able to answer, other than to tell you that we are very excited about what we have in the product pipeline, not for iPod for Mac and our whole product pipeline.\nBill Hand - Bear Stearns: Okay, just another question regarding the new MacTel product. Are there any particular issues that are holding back the launch of the rest of the MacTel line that you can talk about?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We're on target. There's nothing holding it back. We\u2019re on target to complete by the end of the year as we have now.\nBill Hand - Bear Stearns: Okay, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Joel Wagonfeld of First Albany.\n Joel Wagonfeld - First Albany Capital : Thank you. I wanted to go into a little bit more detail on your expectations for gross margin next quarter. You mentioned Flash price advantage as a key advantage in your gross margin upside last quarter. What's the relative benefit that you're anticipating for your gross margin guidance for next quarter? And what are other key levers that might help or hurt the June quarter that could surprise one way or the other.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Joel, I'll start and generally talk about the factors that will affect gross margin, and Tim may want to add some further color. A guiding gross margin down about 140 basis points despite the favorable commodity environment due to several factors: first, the June quarter begins the education buying season, particularly for K to 12 which buys lower ASP and margin Macs; and secondly, we will see the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle price reduction that we took in the introduction of the 1GB Nano.\n Joel Wagonfeld - First Albany Capital : But in terms of the relative benefit of your Flash advantage, is it about the same as it was last quarter?\nTim Cook: We don't want to get into the specifics of that, other than to say that we continue to view both LCD and NAND Flash in a very favorable environment for the current quarter.\n Joel Wagonfeld - First Albany Capital : Okay, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Joel. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll take it from Shaw Wu of American Technology.\nShaw Wu - American Technology: Thanks. Any update on use of cash? I mean, your cash position continues to build -- well, not this specific quarter, but any comment there? Any comments on Braeburn Capital? Thanks.\nTim Cook: All right. Shaw, regarding our use of cash, we are continuing to be conservative with the cash, despite some of the investments we made this quarter. We\u2019re wanting to retain it for flexibility to invest in the business. We do discuss with the board from time to time share buyback, but don't have a change in philosophy to discuss with you today. As regards to Braeburn, we are opening an office in Nevada as part of our treasury operations, in addition to our offices in Cupertino, Cork and Singapore.\nShaw Wu - American Technology: That's it? Thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shaw. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Steve Lidberg of Pacific Crest Securities.\nSteve Lidberg - Pacific Crest Securities: Good afternoon. First, I was hoping that you could provide kind of a sense as to the Mac units and what percentage of them were Intel-based systems. And then secondly, as you look at the iPod business, where are the points of presence, or where is the number for points presence today? How is that situated between the U.S. market and the international markets? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Hi, Steve, it's Tim. We\u2019re not releasing the exact percentage of Intel versus PowerPC for the quarter of the Mac area, but I can tell you that the shipments of the Intel units did accelerate across the quarter and the majority of shipments that we made in the month of March were Intel based. In regards to the iPod points of presence, we now have over 35,000 store fronts across the world. We believe that we are at or near full distribution in the U.S., in some countries in Europe. But we believe there's still opportunity in other countries in Europe, in Japan and Asia and Latin America and Canada. And so we're continuing to find and sign very good channel partners.\nSteve Lidberg - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll take the next question from Harry Blount of Lehman Brothers.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Thank you. A couple questions. First of all, on the PC unit side of the equation, it looks like you had good growth year over year in Europe, and I was wondering if that may be related to additional distribution locations on the PC?\nTim Cook: The difference in Europe's overall year-over-year growth versus the company's was principally an increase in channel inventory related to MacBook Pro units being in transit at the end of the quarter that I had spoken about earlier. And so the growth rate looks very similar to the rest of the world.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: And then related to that, how many Mac locations do you currently have?\nTim Cook: We currently have around 7,000 around the world.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: And then just in terms of trends between direct and indirect, can you give some sense of how iPods and PCs have trended over the last several quarters?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We don't break iPod and Mac direct/indirect out, but our direct sales in the March quarter were 44%, and in that we include direct sales to education and enterprise customers on-line, retail and our Music Store.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Okay, and then the last question also relates to PC distribution. I understand what you guys were saying upfront in terms of the Intel stall, but if I look at the retail units, PC retail units sold -- even on a year over year basis, given that you guys have maybe three or four dozen more stores open -- it would actually suggest that the PC units per store are down fairly meaningfully on a year over year basis. I guess it seems counterintuitive that the stores would be the place that people would be most likely to convert, given the support that they have and the selection of inventory, so a little bit more thoughts on that would be helpful.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. You know, as I commented earlier, our retail stores are really focusing on the Intel transition. We made announcements at MacWorld and shipped and delivered product later, particularly with the MacBook Pro, and this impacted our stores. And again, the stores were really focused from a Mac perspective on the transition to Intel. We very quickly changed the merchandising in the window displays and the graphics to focus on the Intel transition right after MacWorld in advance of product coming to the stores. As our first Intel-based Macs arrived in the stores, we generally stopped carrying the PowerPC based models. And as you may have seen, as I indicated, our sales teams really didn't discourage people from waiting for Intel-based models to arrive and really let the customer purchase what they wanted to, and that impacted us in the quarter. We remain very, very confident in our retail stores, they are delivering strong growth to the company, and our new-to-Mac percent in the quarter actually rose to about 50%.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: One last question. I meant to come back to the margin side real quickly. You guys had started several quarters ago the royalty licensing program, and obviously that's a contribution to margins as well. You didn't mention that, and so I'm wondering as it relates to iPod margins overall, was that a contributing factor?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I\u2019m sorry, Harry, I can't comment on that because those agreements are confidential.\nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks. Can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take the next question from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Hi, good afternoon. Just a question on your new facility. Any idea what you're going to spend on CapEx for that? I think you said $120 million was for the data center, which I think Steve mentioned you'd put together like, nine parcels or something? And then also the 3,000 to 3,500 employees, are those going to be incremental to sort of your current head count do you think, or is that just consolidating Cupertino?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Let me go back through that. In the quarter, we spent about $120 million to acquire a new data center to support our future growth, and the first of several properties for a second campus in Cupertino. As a result of the growth that we've had, we have increased the number of leased buildings in the greater Cupertino area, and this has become really much less efficient and very inconvenient for us. So we've gone out and are in the process of acquiring about 50 acres that are just about 10 minutes away from our current campus. We expect to break ground in a few years, and hopefully complete a second campus in around four years. We very much look forward to getting our teams closer together. So the idea would really be to consolidate the teams that we have into two campuses. We have about 30 buildings scattered across Cupertino that the people are in.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay. How many employees work at the one Infinite Loop campus right now?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We have many thousand employees here in Cupertino, but we aren't disclosing how many are on the campus.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and then moving on. Profitability of iTunes, are you still running for break even? What are your thought processes, as you obviously have expanded the content significantly?\nPeter Oppenheimer: As I commented before, the store operated above break even in the quarter, and we think selling songs and video is really helping us to sell iPods.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and then one final question. Can you just clarify the retail profit, just the profit from your retail stores this quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. The segment profit was $29 million, and the manufacturing margin that was not included in the segment profit was $128 million.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from David Bailey. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Yes, thank you. Just a quick clarification, did you say that you increased iPod channel inventory by 550,000 units in the December quarter and can you tell us how many units, if any, that you added in the March quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: David, we did increase channel inventory in the December quarter by 550. As we entered the quarter, we were within the targeted range of four to six weeks on a look-forward basis, and as we exited the quarter, we were within that range. And also, the number of weeks is approximately the same in both cases.\nNancy Paxton: Okay, thank you, David, and thanks to everyone for joining us.

In connection with SEC rules on corporate disclosure Apple is making this analyst call open to the media and general public by broadcasting the call live over the internet. With that i would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer, CFO: Thank for joining us. We are extremely proud to report a tremendous first quarter for Apple. Revenue of $5.75 billion increased over $2 billion from last quarter\u2019s record revenue and was up 65% year-over-year. This quarterly results also exceeded Apple\u2019s revenue for all of fiscal 2002. The quarter\u2019s revenue was fueled by record shattering iPod sales, solid Mac sales and 14th week of business during the quarter. Quarterly net income nearly doubled on a year-over-year basis and also widely eclipsed the previous record established in the September quarter. Based on an unusually strong operating margin of 13% net income was $565 million or $0.65 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Excluding the impact of non-cash stock based compensation operating margin was 13.8%, net income was $595 million and diluted earnings per shares was $0.68. I will now provide highlights of our two businesses, Mac and Music. Our Mac business generated 41% of total revenue which was up 12% from the year-ago quarter. Mac shipments increased 20% year-over-year to $1.254 million the highest quarterly total in six years. We continued to experience strong portable system sales. We shipped the combined total of 587,000 iBooks and PowerBooks representing 39% year-over-year growth. We shipped 667,000 Desktops systems representing 7% year-over-year growth. Mac unit sales exceeded our internal expectations despite of what we believe was a positive sale associated with the Intel transition. Reflecting on the September and December quarters, we were pleased with the lower than expected impact at the Intel transition on sales and with the moment of our Mac business. Our ending channel inventory remain below our target of 4-5 weeks as planned due to our Intel based Macintosh announced at Mac World. Our Music business generated 59% of total Apple revenue in the quarter and was up 145% compared to the year-ago quarter. We sold over 14 million iPods during the quarter, more than three times the number we sold in the year-ago quarter and more than double the previous record number of iPods we sold in the September quarter. We are particularly proud of our execution given that we replaced two of our three iPod lines including the highest volume iPod Mini line as we entered the holiday season. Customer reactions about the iPod Nano and the 5th generation iPod. IPod channel inventories were lower than we would have liked during the quarter. At the end of the quarter including units in transit our channel inventory levels were within our 4-6 weeks target range based on our current US demand for the seasonally lower March quarter. It was a landmark quarter for the iTunes music store with the addition of television, music video and short term content to the store\u2019s vast and growing library of music and audio books. The iTunes music store continues to be the world\u2019s leading online music service and currently operates in 21 countries that represent over 90% of the global music market. We have sold over 850 million songs and 8 million videos to date. And according to Nielsen Sound Scan Apple accounted for 83% share of the US market of legally purchased and downloaded music during the month of December. The Apple Retail stores reached a significant new milestone in the December quarter by generating $1.072 billion in revenue compared to $561 million in the year-ago quarter. We opened 11 new stores during the quarter exiting with a 135. With an average of 129 stores opened during the quarter average quarterly revenue per store was $8.3 million up 41% from the year-ago quarter. Retail segments profits grew sharply to $90 million from $45 million in the year-ago quarter. And associated manufacturing margin not reflected in retail segment profit with a $199 million up from $99 million in the year-ago quarter. We are particularly proud of the moment we have realized in our stores. With fiscal 2004 after 3 years of operation we generated $1.185 billion in annual revenue through the stores. In fiscal 2005 we nearly doubled that number $2.35 billion. Now in a single quarter we have surpassed $1 billion in revenue. We will continue to add new stores at a measured pace and expect to open a total of 40 new stores during fiscal of \u201906. In terms of geographic results including sales from our retail stores quarterly revenue in Japan, the Americas and Europe was up year-over-year by 92%, 70% and 51% respectively. Gross margin was 27.2% on a GAAP basis and included $5 million in expense related to non-cash stock based compensation. Without this expense non-GAAP gross margin would have been 27.3%. GAAP operating expenses were $814 million including $39 million in expense related to stock based compensation. Non-GAAP Opex was $775 million $55 million higher than our guidance primarily due to variable expenses associated with the higher revenue level, a greater than expected mix of direct sales and investments we made in our business. OYME (ph) was $81 million and the tax rate was 32%. Cash grew by $446 million during the quarter to $8.707 billion. We made prepayment of $750 million related to previously announced agreements for future supply of NAND Flash memory components. Without these prepayments cash would have increased by about $1.2 billion. The cash generation was primarily a function of strong earnings, excellent working capital management and employee stock option exercises. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was about $283 million which includes the impact of a $750 million prepayments. Capital expenditures in the quarter were $82 million including $40 million for our retail initiative. Looking ahead for the March quarter i would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. Quarter-to-quarter which will span a fiscal 13 rather than 14 weeks we are targeting the second best quarter in the company\u2019s history second only to the last quarter with revenues of about $4.3 billion. This target represents 33% year-over-year growth and an increase of over $1 billion year-over-year. We are factoring into our guidance a seasonal decline in iPods in the beginning of our transition of Intel based Mac. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash stock based compensation to be approximately $49 million. We expect GAAP gross margins to be about 27.8% reflecting approximately $5 million related to stock based compensation expense. Without that expense we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be about 27.9%. We expect GAAP Opex to be about $774 million including about $44 million related to stock based compensation. We expect non-GAAP Opex to be about $730 million. We expect OYME (ph) to be $72 million and we expect the tax rate to be 32%. We expect to generate GAAP EPS of about $0.38 which includes an anticipated $0.4 per share related to non-cash share based compensation expense. We expect non-GAAP EPS to be about $0.42. During the March quarter, we expect to pay the remaining the $500 million of the $1.25 billion NAND Flash repayment. We just completed the best quarter in Apple\u2019s history, and fiscal \u201906 is off to a great start. Our new Intel based Mac announced at Mac World has been very well received. We remain extremely enthusiastic about our innovative product pipeline and we are confident in our strategy. With that I would like to open the call for questions.\nQuestions And Answers:\nOperator:\nOperator Instructions:\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: A couple of things, Peter do you \u2013 are you able to quantify the impact of the extra week, I believe last year you did not have the week after Christmas, this year you did, and so was this year\u2019s extra week extra big or is it really hard to say and then I just wanted to ask more about your guidance, so it would be great if you can just answer.\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Let me answer your first question. Yes, the 14th week this year, did span between Christmas day and New Year\u2019s day and that is traditionally and it is was year, a very strong shopping week, and our earnings expenses and revenue were all higher as a result.\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: Okay. I mean is it possible to say like it added a million or 2 million iPods or is it just too hard to say?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Ben, I would characterize it as a big week.\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: Then with regard to your outlook, I mean can you just tell us a little more about what you are expecting with the Intel transition, I mean, you are coming off a quarter where you guided 4.7, you are coming in at 5.75, I mean, now you are at 4.3, shouldn\u2019t we assume, why are being so conservative, a little more detail on this exact Intel transition issue, would be helpful, may be even if you can go back to the weeks of inventory and what you might expect further drain or anything else.\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Let me, I\u2019ll let Tim address, our channel inventory. But let me just speak to you in a little broader term about our guidance. We factored a number of considerations into developing our guidance. Our first, then, this really was your first question, Q1 spanned 14 weeks, and Q2 will span a normal 13 weeks. And again the 14th week that we had this quarter was the week between Christmas and New Year which is a very strong, sharp shopping week. Second, for our Mac business, we have factored in the very strong response that we\u2019ve received for the new Intel-based Mac that we announced at Mac World, the limited number of shipping weeks that we will have on the MacBook Pro and the positives that we saw in customer demand for Q1. For the iPods we have factored the extraordinary demand in Q1 which was fueled by iPods being one of the top holiday gifts of the season, some channel fill that we had and the seasonal drop in demand as we go from holiday quarter to the March quarter.\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: Did you say channel inventory for iPods were within the range or even at the low end?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: They were within the range but maybe i\u2019ll let Tim make some comments on both Mac and iPod inventory.\nA - Timothy Cook: On iPod channel inventory, as it has been widely reported in number places, our channel inventories were lower than we would have liked, for most of the quarter. Shipments did improve on iPod across the quarter, in particular in the second half of December, the shipments were very strong. With the strong shipments, the total channel inventory which included a significant amount of inventory that was in transit at the end of the quarter increased by approximately 550,000 units as compared to the channel inventory at the beginning of the quarter. Despite that the ending channel inventory was still below the target range of 4-6 weeks based December sales. However we believe that the channel inventory is within our targeted range of 4-6 weeks, based on our current view of demand for the seasonally lower March quarter. In terms of the Mac channel inventory, we began the quarter below the targeted range of 4-5 weeks, and as we had planned we ended the quarter below the targeted range in preparation for the Mac World announcements that we made last week.\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: Okay. Tim, i am going speed it for one more, the \u2013 just, i see a situation where you still may have some lower than expected channel inventory but, may be now are you seeing anything out there that is giving you any pause in the economy or in the consumer markets other than some of these Apple related events that you are talking about?\nA - Timothy Cook: What we are seeing is, we had extraordinary response last week to our announcements at Mac World, we are thrilled with the reactions that we\u2019ve got including the bookings on the new iMac and the PowerBook, our MacBook Pro, the last quarter we did see a pause as some customers began to speculate about the upcoming announcements at Mac World however, the Mac beat our internal expectations as Peter just said, we obviously factored some level of pause into our guidance and we were able to beat that number and we are happy with that and the overall moment of the Mac business.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Ben, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Robert Semple from Credit Suisse First Boston is our next question.\nQ - Robert Semple: Just kindly of looking at the Opex guidance, it is now basically inline with your sales guidance, i know you don\u2019t give a target model anymore but historically you used to try to keep that tracking at about 50% of the growth of sales, how should we be thinking about that, do you need to be spending this much if top line growth is going to be slowing like this?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: We, as I said we are very confident in our business, in our strategy and we are continuing to invest for long term growth, both in revenue and in earnings. I\u2019ve provided very strong guidance for the March quarter with revenue growing at 33% and double digit operating margin.\nQ - Robert Semple: I guess one follow up on the Mac question. Obviously you have had a strong response for the new product, does this mean you are very scared about iBook and PowerBook sales really deteriorating until those two new products are launched as well?\nA - Timothy Cook: We did see a pause quarter as Peter has said we have factored what we saw last quarter, end of the quarters guidance, we are thrilled with the response that we got last week and as we said we started shipments of the iMac already and given that we\u2019ve got an entire to ship it, we believe we can, we are hopeful that we can meet the demand on the iMac. But also as we announced last week, the MacBook Pro will begin shipping in February and therefore has a limited number of weeks to ship during the quarter, given that and the very strong response that we saw, we may not be able to meet the demand on the MacBook Pro.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Rob, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Rebecca Runkle of Morgan Stanley.\nQ \u2013 Rebecca Runkle: Obviously phenomenal quarter, just wanted to dig down a little bit more on the CPU side of the equation, you have reported several times the fact that you saw a pause, since that was the one area where some people could say, they were disappointed on the December results. Can you just provide a little bit more specificity in terms of what you saw that gives you a confident that this is purely a pause in front of the product cycle as compared to any disconnect on the \u201cHalo Effect\ufffd? that many people have?\nA - Timothy Cook: Let me make some comments. First of all the Mac business grew 20% year-over-year and it did exceed our internal expectations which had factored again at a level upon. We did see a pause, we\u2019ve received reports from a number of customer from different markets that they were postponing purchases tending Mac World announcements, however in our results last week that we saw in the reaction last week is extraordinary and that gives us tremendous optimism about the customer reaction and on the Intel based Macintosh. It is very difficult to predict how customers will react this quarter. And so obviously factored in a that kind of thinking into our guidance. A year ago we had a situation as you recall the comparison of the quarter where we had, a significant shortage of G5 chip in the September quarter and then we began to fill the channel and serve the pent-up demand as we entered the December quarter. And so the comparison frankly is also a difficult comparison. That has to be taken to consideration as well and looking at the year-over-year results.\nQ \u2013 Rebecca Runkle: You specifically like to talk about specific products anymore but would you atleast confirm that more of the slowdown happened on the professional side of the equation as opposed to the consumer side of the equation? Or is there another trend that you saw?\nA - Timothy Cook: We had some level of reports from customers in different markets, i wouldn\u2019t want to pin it on one market above the other.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Rebecca, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bill Shope of J.P.Morgan.\nQ - Bill Shope: First of all, on your website you are still offering the iMac G5, obviously the PowerMac G4. They are at the same price as the new Intel based Mac, that you highlighted at Mac World. Can you give us an idea of how much inventory you are still need to work through for the legacy products and also help us understand how you work through that inventory without discounting?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: We don\u2019t Bill, talk about future products or future pricing but we certainly factored our thinking into our guidance and we will continue to ship the iMac G5 and the PowerBook 15 inch wealth of iBook.\nQ - Bill Shope: Okay. Just a clarification on the in-transit inventory that you included in your channel inventory number, that is not recognized as revenue yet. You don\u2019t recognize until it actually arrived at the retailer or is that incorrect?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: We recognize shipment of our products in most cases, when they are shipped from our factories.\nQ - Bill Shope: One final question. Can you give us read on margins for the iPod business for the quarter?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Sure. As you know i don\u2019t want to be, for competitive reasons specific in what we want to talk about, specific iPod sales, but i will tell you that the iPod gross margins in the December quarter were above 20%.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Bill, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Charles Wolf of Needham & Company.\nQ - Charles Wolf: Yes. I have few questions. What was expressed on Apple Store Mac sales between Windows and Mac users?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Charlie, i am sorry, i don\u2019t have that.\nQ - Charles Wolf: Okay. What was the split between iPod sales, domestic versus international?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Charlie, as i have indicated in Bill\u2019s question, we don\u2019t want to talk about iPod sales by model or geography. I can tell you that with 14 million sold last quarter, we were thrilled with that result and there were points in the quarter where we were too low in our many of our channels.\nQ - Charles Wolf: Okay. Let me ask the final question then. At the Mac World keynote last week, Steve indicated that music downloads were running at 3 million per week, i believe, i assume that that level was reached through a lot of redemption\u2019s of gift certificates, is that a reasonable assumption?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Yes. In the december quarter we sold a lot of iTunes Music gift cards and certificates over the store but we were also having people purchase directly as well, and we couldn\u2019t have been happier with the sales of iTunes in the December quarter.\nA - Timothy Cook: Yeah. Charlie that is 3 million per day, not 3 million per week for clarity.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Charlie, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Shannon Cross of Cross Research\nQ \u2013 Shannon Cross: Can you give us an idea in terms of availability of components from Intel and specifically is that leading to any delays in terms of getting the MacBook Pro out? Just specifics, you said February, it is earlier rather than later in the month?\nA - Timothy Cook: Let me answer the question broadly about the supply of the iMac and the MacBook Pro. We\u2019ve begin to ship the iMac, we are very happy with how the production ramp is going. We are extremely happy with the response we had last week as i\u2019ve said before, and we are hopeful that we could meet the demand for the quarter. On the MacBook Pro as planned we are beginning to ship that in February and given the number of weeks that would remain in the quarter to ship and the extraordinary response that we\u2019ve seen with our customers we may not be able to meet demand on that product.\nQ \u2013 Shannon Cross: And with regard to any product constraints in the last quarter, any thoughts on air freighting, any incremental cost that were associated with any shortages?\nA - Timothy Cook: In the current quarter, that factored into our guidance we would be airfreighting the Intel based iMac in order to get those into customers hands very quickly. We are also in the results in our Q1 that has Peter has talked to airfreighted some number of iMacs as we had rose the multiple line up in October.\nQ \u2013 Shannon Cross: Okay. And then finally, can you give us an idea of how many outlets, you are now selling iPods in?\nA - Timothy Cook: We are over 35000 at this point although we do not sell all models in all outlets.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Shannon, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Joel Wagonfeld of First Albany Capital.\nQ - Joel Wagonfeld: Two part question, if i could. 1) is there any chance the new iMac and the PowerBook have better gross margins given the scale of the Intel Eco system for other parts of the component. 2) is it accurate of the impact of any price protection that you may have incorporated for plan discounts of the legacy G5 and G4 Mac, with that already be incorporated in the December quarter and hence that would negatively impact this March quarter and finally i just wanted to be clear, are you saying that with your comments on the inventory that the supply and demand are now in balance for all of the iPods includes the NANO 4gig?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Let is answer your first two questions and Tim can address your third. As regards the Intel based Mac gross margins we don\u2019t to provide specific gross margins for any of our products, i have given you pretty detailed guidance for the December quarter. And i am sorry what was your second question?\nQ - Joel Wagonfeld: The impact of any price protection, that would have already been incorporated last quarter?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: As i had earlier mentioned we are not going to talk about product plans or pricing actions that we have not already have announced but i can tell you that any price protection that would effect our channel inventory that contemplate, we provided for in our December quarter and in future action beyond that, would not affect the channel inventory but March quarter is down in, we have factored into our guidance for the March quarter.\nA - Timothy Cook: Relative to the channel inventory on iPod on an aggregate basis, we believe that we are within our targeted range of 4-6 weeks based on our current of view of demand for the quarter however, there are stock out in different places on different models and also some countries are leaner than others. We are working very very hard right now, to alleviate this situation.\nQ - Joel Wagonfeld: is the 4gig still the key bottleneck?\nA - Timothy Cook: The 4gig is lean in places that we are working very hard to get those gigs NANOs out there.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Joel, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.\nQ - Gene Munster: Just in terms of the big picture here, conceptually where you are going with the market share plan here, do you see yourself being a little bit more aggressive 2006, in terms of your efforts to gain market share, maybe just in terms of breadth of distribution and other ways that you could gain market share?\nA - Timothy Cook: Gene, is your question on the Macintosh or the iPods?\nQ - Gene Munster: On the Mac side.\nA - Timothy Cook:\nQ - Gene Munster: But there are also just of couple of, doing the product side which i would say is they are important but there is also, the distribution side and the pricing side, and you guys can probably have an opportunity to really put the hammer down in terms of picking up market share in 2006. So just conceptually, obviously you guys like to talk about pricing, but conceptually do you see Apple being more aggressive, trying to gain market share in 2006 or kind of continue to the status quo of creating the best products, happen \u2013to be more selective in terms of distribution, more selective in terms of price.\nA - Timothy Cook: We are going to continue to make the best products on the face of the earth, that is reason that we are here. On a distribution basis, we continue to open stores, we also continue to look at different alternatives to the channel, and when responding that we like and we would obviously view that, they are beneficial, i wouldn\u2019t want to comment on the price question.\nQ - Gene Munster: And just last question is, outside of the extra week in the December quarter, and outside of people postponing their purchases in anticipation of the Intel based, is there any reason to think that the seasonality between December March should be any different than previous years?\nA - Timothy Cook: On the Macintosh or the iPod?\nQ - Gene Munster: Just the overall business, the overall seasonality between December and March.\nA - Timothy Cook: Yes. There is a reason to think that seasonality of the total company would be different because the music business with a much higher percentage of our business in the December quarter than it had previously been and so obviously the iPod would have a different seasonal curve than the Macintosh to have.\nQ - Gene Munster: Okay. That makes sense. Great thank you.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Gene, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Richard Chu of Sg. Cowen & Co.\nQ \u2013 Richard Chu: I just wanted to repeat this but, three questions, seasonality on the guidance, you are assuming this similar, i have seen a stronger seasonal decline in the resent systems, is that impromptu to comment?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Richard, we didn\u2019t hear you, would you repeat?\nQ \u2013 Richard Chu: The impact of the Tim\u2019s response to the prior question was, effectively that you are assuming a larger seasonal decline in music business than the Mac business?\nA - Timothy Cook: What i am saying specifically is that if you look at previous years for Apple, and the Q1 results, and just look at the total revenue, we would not expect the total revenue to look the same sequentially that had in the past, because we were operating at a much higher music content in the Q1 in the holiday period.\nQ \u2013 Richard Chu: If i can follow on the second question, you kept, as you said, the old product pricing is unchanged, can i fundamentally ask why, just that you assume users perceive the things, your performance for what they need. Could you comment on that?\nA - Timothy Cook: We are selling the iMac G5 and the PowerBook G4 15H product while supplies last. And we factored our thinking into our guidance.\nQ \u2013 Richard Chu: So effectively you are saying, so you see no need to reduce prices, in spite of the perceived difference in value?\nA - Timothy Cook: I am saying that anything that we are planning on doing we factored into our guidance. And that we are only selling these while supplies last.\nQ \u2013 Richard Chu: And finally, if upon rough calculations on the implied music and video downloads are revenue streams, are correct, excluding that downloads at iPod, the remainder of the music revenue streams look like they are non-iPod non-download music revenues increased dramatically Q4 to Q1 and could you comment on that and comment on the seasonality and dynamic associated with that business.\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Richard this is Peter. There are now over 2000 different accessories that you can buy with your iPod and fundamentally those are the revenue streams that i think that you are referring to. We did very well with our sales with these in the quarter, both the Apple branded and our third party developers that we sold directly. We expect to have a good quarter in March and honestly we are going to learn more about the seasonality of this part of the business because it is bigger, it is growing, i have said this before and believe it to be the case that many people will buy and iPod and then later come back to add accessories to it. And this seems to be a part of our business that has more of a recurring revenue stream, much like the iTunes music stores and we are very pleased with what we are seeing and we are learning more about it.\nQ \u2013 Richard Chu: Can you update us on profitability of the music store?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: The music store in the December did operate above break even.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Richard Chu, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from Richard Gardner of Citigroup.\nQ - Richard Gardner: Tim, i was hoping if you could just give us standard pitch on component pricing and availability during the first and second fiscal quarters for the major commodities that you buy and then also i was hoping if you could give us the mix of web direct sales in the quarter please.\nA - Timothy Cook: On a component basis, Rich what we saw last quarter was that the, we have a favorable component environment, both in terms of LCDs and memory, both of those were most stabilize than we had predicted, as we enter into this quarter, we continue to see the LCDs being a favorable environment, because supply is greater than demand, we do expect the DRAM market stabilizes on as more of the manufacturing capacity is converted to NAND Flash. Hard drive prices continue to decline but they are declining at a lower than attributable rate due to some underlying components.\nQ - Richard Gardner: And any comments on flash?\nA - Timothy Cook: I would tell not to continue to expect price reductions in the flash area as more and more and people convert their DRAM capacity to NAND in short term, but overall as you can tell by the amount of prepay that we\u2019ve elected to do, we view that particular market as not having as many down turns as some of the other commodity markets then, we believe that it is very important to lock supplies for the long term.\nQ - Richard Gardner: And then web direct sales in the quarter.\nA - Timothy Cook: We don\u2019t release the exact numbers but i would tell you that the web sales was significant in the quarter.\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Rich, i will add with overall our direct sales which include the web sales that Tim referred to, sales through our retail stores, and direct sales to US education and enterprise and music stores comprised of 49% of total Apple revenue and that was up from 44% in the year ago quarter.\nQ - Richard Gardner: And then may be Peter, just one more simple one for you. Can you talk about the location of the 14 new store openings that you talked about fiscal 2006. How many of those are domestic versus international?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: We expect most of those to be domestically but we will continue to open stores in Canada, the UK and Japan as well.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Richard Gardner, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Steven Fortuna of Prudential Equity Group.\nQ - Steven Fortuna: In terms of the seasonality of the iPod, it seems which you are baking into your guidance, in terms of my model, at least so much of your earnings power for the quarter and for the year for that matter, depends upon what assumptions one makes for seasonality in the March quarter end, looks like your guiding, if i am doing it quickly, it perhaps not accurate, looks about 45% sequential decline in iPod, it looks may be bacon in that kind of a decline to get to the numbers that you guiding to, i think first of all, i am in the ballpark with that and secondly if you don\u2019t comment on the iPod things specifically, how do you think about the broader CE market in terms of the typical March seasonality.\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Steve, it is Peter, I\u2019ll address that. I am not going to provide specific product level guidance, to think you thought i would, but let me make some comments what was last year and related little bit to this year. Last year we did see a seasonal drop off, in the combination of our iPod and the iPod Mini line which was more than offset by the introduction of the iPod shuffle. And as was widely reported and we\u2019ve commented, the iPod was one of the top holiday gifts this season and it is natural to think that they will be decrease in demand in the March quarter from this exceptional holiday result which again included a 14th week. And you can go out get some primary research on what you would see for various CE products.\nQ - Steven Fortuna: And then, in terms of okay, I\u2019ll leave that alone and then go on to my last question, can you walk through, Tim commented on what you expect for component in the March quarter, go through, because of the kind of puts and stakes that you factored into your gross margin guidance?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Basically, i am a factory man, a different product mix which would include fewer iPods and a lower component cost.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Steven Fortuna, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Keith Bachman Banc of America Securities.\nQ -Keith Bachman: Two questions if i could. Tim i just wanted to clarify, i think what you said was you started the quarter with some low inventory in the CPU side and you ended a bit low too, so it didn\u2019t sound like inventory played a big role in the December quarter in the CPU side can you just clarify that if i could for the first question?\nA - Timothy Cook: We started below our range, we ended below our range, and we had planned that Keith because of the announcements that we made at Mac World.\nQ -Keith Bachman: The second questions, is there anyway to conceptually think about your CPU business may split in terms of the units at all between the Intel side and the Mac side in this quarter, is there any kind of general plan that you could think since there is the vast majority of the platform is still on the IBM processor side or the G processor side. Is that 80-20 or any kind of color you could give us there?\nA - Timothy Cook: We are producing the best Macintosh that has ever been produced and there are great products that have Power PC processors in them and incredible products that have Intel processors in them and we just have to see how the customers vote in terms of the percentage of each.\nQ -Keith Bachman: Well let me ask the software part of the question and Tim, At least at Mac World, the Cox coming natively, and then the Apple software suite is running natively in sounds like Rezatto and emulation is still, going to be a part of the software side of the equation, so you still have the emulation. Do you think that is going to cause people to pause it off in terms of the performance that you didn\u2019t get?\nA - Timothy Cook: What we are seeing is that Rezatto runs very well with products like Microsoft Office as an example and as you commented we have already reported the iLight suite and it is shifting on the new iMac, new MacBook Pro. We\u2019ve already ported iWare. Obviously the OS is native and all of the applications embedded in the OS that is just mail, iChat etc., are also ported. We\u2019ve also announced as you refer, that our, the bulk of our Pro application will be available in March natively. It is just includes final product and logic and aperture expenses. There are a lot of things that are already native and in fact as we\u2019ve announced last week, the website has recorded over 200 native ads already, and well over 1500 witches. And so we are seeing great moment for our developer community and i think by making the announcement, obviously people are even more anxious than they already were to complete the work and we are very confident that we\u2019ll continue to see great momentum in that area.\nQ -Keith Bachman: Any idea when Microsoft and Adobe might be needed.\nA - Timothy Cook: I think that is a question for them, however, we worked closely with Microsoft with running Rezatto and if you, i would invite you to try that yourself and we certainly believe that users will be very satisfied with that experience.\nQ -Keith Bachman: Okay. Fair enough, thanks very much guys.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Keith Bachman, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: David Bailey of Goldman Sachs.\nQ \u2013 David Bailey: You mentioned that iPod margins were about above 20% in the quarter, is that from lower component cost, or a better mix and how sustainable is that?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: David, i don\u2019t want to be specific any of those parts of your question and just we said that they were above 20% in the quarter, and i will report to you in April what they were for the March quarter.\nQ \u2013 David Bailey: Okay. Let me try something on the Mac side. Do you expect to end the March quarter within your targeted channel inventory range. And if so how much build you think you will have in the quarter, how much you have included in your target?\nA - Timothy Cook: We don\u2019t project channel inventory, David, we guide to a total revenue number and Peter has provided that guidance.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks David, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Shaw Wu of American Technology.\nQ \u2013 Shaw Wu: Yes. Two questions. Europe looked like there was very very strong, just wanted if you could give more color in terms of what happened there in terms of i guess the Mac business versus the music business and then the second question R&D, looks like it took a big of spike in terms of the absolute dollars, but certainly not so on the percentage of the revenue, just wondering how should we think of R&D spending, should we think remaining at these levels, or could it turn down?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Shaw, let me address your R&D question and Tim can talk a bit about Europe. As i mentioned earlier we are very confident in our business and we are investing in the business for long term growth and both revenue and earnings and a big part of that is our investment in engineering and you have seen it go up, each quarter for the last many quarters and just expect it continue to invest not only in engineering but in opening more retail stores and more advertising and marketing program to grow the business.\nA - Timothy Cook: Shaw, on the Europe side the Mac shipments were up 49% sequentially from September, but as you probably know that the September quarter in Europe is the traditionally weak quarter because the summer vacation that happen across most of Europe. In terms of revenue Europe with retail stores was up over 50% and frankly there were many countries in Europe that had more relatively more iPods constraints so that revenue number was held down iPods a bit more than some of the other geographies.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Shaw, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Steve Lidberg of Pacific Crest Securities.\nQ - Steve Lidberg: I was hoping first with regards to iPod if you kind of outline how you see the opportunity for the iPod in terms of units or other market comparisons and on the total opportunity available and also with regards to creative professional can you comment with regards to the health of that market both from a video perspective as well as publishing?\nA - Timothy Cook: On your second question, on the creative professional we saw good growth in the video market on a year-over-year basis, we were very pleased with it, DNP was weak and if it is as you know the DNP market itself is not a hugely growing market, it is just that not out of our expectation though by any means. In terms of opportunities on the iPod, we see iPod as the absolute best player in the market. We only recently announced the iPod Nano and the iPod, there is more video content on the way with the iPod and so i think there continues to be significant opportunity for the iPod in the overall music business.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Steve, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Benjamin Reitzes of UBS.\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: Good afternoon again and couple of things, just caught me a little off guard, it was pretty quick. With regards to other music at 491 much better than expected. I am just wondering, was there anything in there, that that particularly helpful meaning you are seeing a lot of extra shells now iPod accessories in many retailers, maybe if you are able to kind of talk to how much iPod accessories were in that number and what is going on with the iPod Eco system going forward so that we can model that line a little better.\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Ben, the two largest component of the other music related products and services are first the iTunes music store and then the iPod accessories, both the Apple branded that we sell both directly and indirectly and the developer iPod accessories that we sell through the Apple online and retail stores. Both had significant growth year-over-year and sequentially the music store, we couldn\u2019t be happier with it\u2019s performance as indicated earlier, we are serving customers in 21 countries, where over 90% of music is purchased. And we saw just strong growth both year-over-year and sequentially not only in music but with the addition of video and we look forward to bringing more content both here in the United States and in other places before too long. The accessories business continues to grow for us both in terms of the Apple branded and our developers support. We are now have over 2000 accessories that you can buy with your iPod, the vast majority that Apple doesn\u2019t make. And as i said we are beginning to see a bit more of a recurring revenue stream there where people are coming and adding back, that next accessory to their iPod family.\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: Well, will that line where we see the new radio tuner, i believe?\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Yes. Announced at Mac World. Yes. \nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: That radio tuner, any early indications on how that is doing.\nA - Peter Oppenheimer: Well.\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: Okay. And you can meet demand.\nA - Timothy Cook: We are very pleased with the response on it Ben, and we are working very hard to get units out. We are currently not meeting demand but we are working really hard to try to do it. I am not projecting whether we can or not, for the full quarter at this point.\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: I mean, is that like million of units, tracking type of device in the future, that kind of subset of iPod sales, is that the potential where we are looking at. Like a higher attach rate?\nA - Timothy Cook: We don\u2019t give unit level guidance on the product.\nQ - Benjamin Reitzes: I guess, you are helping. Okay thanks a lot.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Thanks Ben, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: We have follow-up question from Rebecca Runkle. Please go ahead.\nQ - Rebecca Runkle: Mine has been answered. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And a follow-up from Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray.\nQ - Piper Jaffray: Mine has been answered as well. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance: Okay. Thanks. Gene and thanks to everyone for joining us.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-lookingstatements or information which speak as of their respected dates. With that, Iwould like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleasedto report record results, including the highest September quarter revenue andearnings in Apple's history. Revenue of $6.22 billion increased 29% over theprior September quarter. The revenue was driven by record Mac sales andcontinued strong demand for iPods. Operating margin for the quarter was stronger than expectedat 17.1%, resulting primarily from higher revenue and gross margin than we hadanticipated. Net income was $904 million, which was up 67% over the priorSeptember quarter\u2019s results and translated to earnings per share of $1.01. I would like to first talk about our Mac products andservices, which represented 62% of our total quarterly revenue. We areextremely pleased to have shipped 2.16 million Macs, 400,000 above the Junequarter\u2019s all-time record for Apple and representing 34% growth over theyear-ago quarter. On a worldwide basis, Apple's growth rate was over two timesIDC\u2019s most recently published market growth rates for the September quarter.Customers responded very favorably to the new iMacs we announced in August,driving 31% year-over-year growth in desktop systems. Demand for Apple's Macbooksand Macbook Pros continued to be very strong. Sales of portables increased 37%over the prior September quarter and accounted for 62% of Macs sold. We endedthe quarter with slightly less than three weeks of Mac channel inventory. Now I would like to discuss our music products and services,which accounted for 36% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold 10.2million iPods, representing 17% growth over the year-ago quarter. We began andended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channelinventory. Reaction to the new iPods announced last month has been verypositive and we are shipping the best iPod lineup ever as we head into theholiday buying season. Apple executed a very smooth transition to an all-newiPod lineup without a hitch. Other music revenue grew 33% year over year, once againfueled by strong iTunes store sales. We are very pleased with initial reactionto the iTunes WiFi music store and our new relationship with Starbucks. iTunescontinued to account for over 85% of songs purchased and downloaded in the U.S.,according to the latest data available from Nielsen Soundscan, and iTunescustomers have now purchased over 3 billion songs and 100 million TV shows. Based on the latest data from ISPI market research, 17% ofglobal music sales in the first half of calendar 2007 were digital, up from 11%in all of 2006. We believe that the popularity of iTunes has been instrumentalto the growth in this trend. Based on the latest data from NPD, iTunes continues to bethe third largest distributor of music in the United States, having surpassedboth Target and Amazon. We are thrilled to have sold 1.1 million iPhones during thequarter and customers are really loving the product. Our research shows that anamazing 95% of iPhone customers would recommend the iPhone to others.Additionally, the research firm Strategy Analytics, estimates that iPhone wasthe fourth highest selling handset in the U.S. market in the September quarter. We are recognizing revenue from iPhone handset sales usingsubscription accounting over a 24-month estimated economic life. Total revenuerecognized during the quarter from sales of iPhones, iPhone accessories, andpayments from AT&T was $118 million. Total deferred revenue from iPhone andApple TV was $636 million at the end of the September quarter compared to $180million at the end of the June quarter. As you know, after lowering the price of iPhone to $399 lastmonth, we offered $100 credit to customers who had purchased an iPhone prior tothe price reduction. We are accounting for the credits as they are redeemed bycharging the associated product cost to cost of goods sold. We anticipate mostof these redemptions to occur by the end of the December quarter. We are on track to begin selling iPhones in Europe onNovember 9th, partnering with O2 in the U.K. and with T-Mobile in Germany. Aswe announced last week, we will begin selling the iPhones in France beginningon November 29th, partnering with Orange. I would like to now turn to the Apple retail stores, whichposted record quarterly revenue and traffic, driven by very strong interest inMacs, our new iPods, and the iPhone. Revenue was $1.25 billion, representing 42% year-over-yeargrowth. The stores generated $268 million in segment margin compared to $156million in the year-ago quarter. We opened 12 new stores during the quarter,ending with 197 stores. With an average of 190 stores open during the quarter,average revenue per store was $6.6 million compared to the $5.6 million in the year-agoquarter. The stores sold 473,000 Macs during the quarter,representing 46% year-over-year growth. Once again, over 50% of the customersbuying Macs in our stores during the quarter were new to Mac. We delivered over 300,000 personal training sessions andended the quarter with 387,000 members in our one-to-one and pro-care programs.Over 31 million people visited our stores during the quarter, representing over12,500 customers per store per week. We will continue to invest in new stores in the U.S. andinternationally, with approximately 40 stores scheduled to open in the comingyear, including previously announced high-profile stores in New York andBoston. We are also pleased to announce plans for our first store in China,which will open in Beijing next summer. Our U.S. education channel also posted an outstandingquarter, with record revenue and Mac shipments. Our new account initiative inthe K12 market was very successful and our extremely popular back-to-schoolpromotion drove strong Macbook and Macbook Pro sales, contributing to our best,higher ed quarter ever, with 36% year-over-year growth in total Mac sales. Total company gross margin was 33.6%, which was lowersequentially but higher than expected, due to a number of factors. We benefitedfrom a higher margin product mix, a weakening U.S. dollar, abetter-than-expected commodity environment, and a higher mix of directbusiness. Operating expenses were $1.03 billion, including $58 millionin stock-based compensation expense. We capitalized $22 million of softwaredevelopment expense related to Leopard during the quarter. OI&E was $170 million. The tax rate for the quarter wasabout 27%, lower than our anticipated rate of 32%, primarily due to a benefitfrom the settlement of prior year audits. We had very strong cash generationduring the quarter, increasing our cash balance to end with $15.4 billion. Cashflow from operations was $1.7 billion. Looking ahead to the December quarter, I would like toreview our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking informationthat Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. For the quarter, we aretargeting revenue of about $9.2 billion. We expect the total quarterly costs ofnon-cash, stock-based compensation to be approximately $92 million. We expect gross margin to be about 31%, reflectingapproximately $12 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We areguiding gross margin down sequentially as a result of several factors,including the full quarter impact of our recent product transitions and reducedpricing, lower sales of iLife and iWork in their second quarter, seasonallyhigher component costs, and a higher mix of indirect sales. We expect op-ex to be about $1.165 billion, including about$80 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about$195 million and we expect the tax rate to return to about 32%. We expect to generate EPS of about $1.42, including ananticipated $0.07 per share related to stock-based compensation. In closing, we are extremely proud of our record-breakingfiscal 2007 results. We generated over $24 billion in revenue and $3.5 billionin net income. We sold 7 million Macs and 52 million iPods, each growing bymore than 30% over the prior year. We introduced the revolutionary iPhone andsold over 1 million in the first 74 days. Our retail stores hosted over 100million visitors and produced $4.1 billion in revenue. We exited the September quarter with great momentum. Macshipments exceeded our previous quarterly record by 400,000 systems and we\u2019revery excited about the arrival of Leopard later this week. We introduced anentirely new lineup of iPods last month and customer reaction has been verystrong. We\u2019ve clearly accelerate the momentum for iPhone sales withour new pricing and we are very enthusiastic about our entry into the Europeanmobile phone market next month. We are looking forward to our best December quarter ever, aswe head into the holiday buying season with the strongest product lineup inApple history. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Ben Reitzesfrom UBS.\nBen Reitzes - UBS: I don\u2019t like to cheerlead, but nice quarter. The question isregarding the guidance. With regard to your usual pattern, Peter, you seem tobe more conservative usually. You guided up versus the street by quite a bit to$9.2 billion, maybe arguably $700 million better. What are you seeing thatallows you to be so confident in the face of some people being worried aboutthe economy at this time?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Regarding the economy, we\u2019ll leave forecasting the globaleconomy to others. But as I commented at the end, Apple is shipping the bestproducts that we have ever made in our history. We just eclipsed the recordthat we set for Mac sales last quarter by 400,000. iPod sales accelerated afterthe transition and we\u2019ll shipping the best iPods that we\u2019ve ever made, and theiPhone is doing really, really well. So we\u2019re quite confident in the businessand we\u2019ve exited the September quarter with a lot of momentum.\nBen Reitzes - UBS: More precisely on the guidance for iPods, it would seem thatlaunching in September, did you feel that a lot of iPod sales are pushed intothe December quarter and not necessarily pushed, but just naturally the fulllineup hasn\u2019t had a chance to be fully reflected and that\u2019s part of the reasonfor the guidance as well, or -- and how do we reconcile the sequential for Macsas well? It would seem the guidance implies Macs are up.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Let me begin with Macs and maybe I\u2019ll let Tim address youriPod question. For Macs, in the two most recent quarters, units have beenrelatively flat from the September quarter to the December quarter, as oureducation business falls off and is more or less offset by holiday consumerbuying. This year, it\u2019s possible that Mac sales could besequentially a little lower, given the extraordinary success of theback-to-school promotion, which intensified the seasonality of the Septemberquarter.\nBen Reitzes - UBS: Okay, so you\u2019re saying Macs could be lower due to thatpromotion? Okay.\nPeter Oppenheimer: It could be. We had just a fantastic September quarter butreally back to school and our higher ed results were an all-time high for thecompany.\nTimothy D. Cook: Ben, in terms of iPod, sales accelerated dramatically afterthe introduction of the new iPod and based on some early market share datawe\u2019ve seen from the U.K., France, and Germany, our share is up significantly inthe month of December, or September. The U.K.up 12 points, Japanup 12 points, and Franceup 6 points. Given these kinds of increases, we feel that we are verywell positioned going into the holiday quarter.\nBen Reitzes - UBS: Got it. And then lastly, with regard to gross margin, Peter,you talked about going from 33.6 to 31, and you mentioned that the iLife salesgo down but we have Leopard shipping on the 26th. I was surprised to hear younot mention that as a major offset on the gross margin line.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, as I commented in my prepared remarks, we are lookingforward to Leopard shipping this week. We are very excited about Leopard, butin terms of -- and I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d forget about that, but I wanted to focusyou on some factors that I think on the net basis will cause more gross marginsto go down, and that\u2019s why I made the comment that I did.\nBen Reitzes - UBS: Thanks a lot, guys.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster - PiperJaffray: Good afternoon and congratulations. Peter, if you could talka little bit about the line item, iPhone related products and services, interms of when I\u2019m doing the math here as far as revenue contribution perquarter for the iPhone, it\u2019s the 1/8th or -- is it by the month or by thequarter? Can you give a little bit of clarity on that? Second is how does it work for the AT&T revenue share --is it also calculated by day, by month or by quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, in terms of iPhone, we are recognizing revenue fromhandset sales over a 24-month period of time. We actually do do that on a dailybasis. Our revenue from iPhone, which includes amortization of handsets, accessorysales, and payments from AT&T was $118 million in the quarter.\nGene Munster - PiperJaffray: Okay, so for the AT&T contribution and the iPhonecontribution, it\u2019s on a 24-month, it depends on the month that the phone issold, is that correct? It\u2019s not the quarter, it\u2019s the month?\nPeter Oppenheimer: No, for the handset, we are amortizing that revenue over 24months but as regards payments from AT&T, we will recognize those paymentsas revenue over time as earned, and I\u2019m not going to get into some more detailthan that.\nGene Munster - PiperJaffray: Okay, so that could be by the day, potentially?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, I\u2019m just not going to get into any more detail aboutour carrier agreements.\nGene Munster - PiperJaffray: Okay, and I guess this is probably another category of moredetails, but is the AT&T, is it generally a longer term kind of agreementor more near-term, or any thoughts along that --\nPeter Oppenheimer: You know, as we indicated a couple of quarters ago, it is amulti-year exclusive agreement.\nGene Munster - PiperJaffray: Okay, and then just one final question; from the Best Buystores, how many Best Buy stores were kind of up and running at the end of thequarter? How many do you expect by the end of the December quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: Gene, we had 230 operating at the end of the Septemberquarter and we expect more than 270 at the end of the December quarter.\nGene Munster - PiperJaffray: Has that had an impact on the business or do you still kindof see that --\nTimothy D. Cook: We\u2019re very pleased with it. It had very good results and weare looking forward to expanding it in this quarter.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Richard Gardner of Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner -Citigroup: Thank you. I had two questions. First of all, I thought itwas quite encouraging that your PC channel inventories were below your targetrange, despite the fact that you did expand the Best Buy agreement in thequarter, and I was hoping you could give us some detail on why that was thecase. And then secondly, I was also surprised to hear that highercomponent prices were one of the reasons that you cited for sequentially lowergross margin in the fourth calendar quarter because, based on our checks, mostcomponents seem to be coming down in price now, so I was hoping that Tim, youmight be able to reconcile that for us.\nTimothy D. Cook: Sure. On your component question, here\u2019s something we seegoing on in the quarter; as you know, Rich, DRAM and NAND Flash markets werefavorable last quarter and we believe that will continue during our Q1. Harddrive and LCDs were tight last quarter and they continue to be at the beginningof this quarter, but we do expect these to stabilize as the quarter unfolds.The other commodities are trading near or are declining near historical norms. In terms of the channel inventory on the Mac, we primarilyhave low inventories at the end of the quarter because our sales were higherthan expected.\nRichard Gardner -Citigroup: Okay, and Tim, that channel inventory calculation is done ona forward sales basis, correct?\nTimothy D. Cook: It\u2019s done on a look-back basis.\nRichard Gardner -Citigroup: Okay. All right, and then finally, I was hoping for clarificationon how your accounting for the iPhone rebate in the quarter? I know youmentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I --\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. We are accounting for the credits as they are redeemedby customers and will charge the associated product costs to costs of goodssold. And as I indicate in my prepared remarks, we anticipate that most ofthese redemptions will occur by the end of the December quarter.\nRichard Gardner -Citigroup: Great. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to David Bailey of Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Bailey -Goldman Sachs: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could help usunderstand your pricing strategy for iPhone in Europe,where the pricing is higher and effectively going up versus the U.S.price as the dollar weakens?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We set our price in Europe, David, when we announced andthat price also includes VATs and other related duties.\nDavid Bailey -Goldman Sachs: And then could you just follow-up and tell us what thepercentage of direct sales were in the quarter and maybe give us some idea ofwhat you are expecting for the December quarter, since this will be a drag ongross margin?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. In the September quarter, our direct sales were 57% oftotal company revenue, and that was up from 53% in the year-ago quarter. Ican\u2019t give you a forecast for this December quarter, but last year in Q1,direct sales were 44% of total company revenue.\nDavid Bailey -Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, David. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.\nKatyHuberty - Morgan Stanley:\nTimothy D. Cook: Europe did have excellent growth. In fact, year over year,we were up 37% in revenue and 47% in units, as you combine the retail storeswith the channel results. In terms of Mac units, this is over four times the IDCprojected gain for Western Europe, and so we are thrilled with the result.Europe did not have the typical lull in August that we have seen. The iMacannouncement and then followed by the iPod announcement early September wasenough to overcompensate for that. We factored our view of the future into the guidance thatPeter provided earlier.\nKaty Huberty - MorganStanley: And then just quickly, Peter, are there any nuances thatwill show up in the model as non-U.S. revenues become a larger percentage ofthe business, as it relates to either the margin profile or tax rate over time?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, I\u2019m not sure how to really answer the first part ofyour question, but in terms of the second part, generally for most U.S.companies, growth in foreign earnings is a benefit to your taxes, your U.S. taxrate.\nKaty Huberty - MorganStanley: Thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Next we\u2019ll go to Shannon Cross ofCross Research.\nShannon Cross - CrossResearch: Good afternoon. Just going back to the revenue question,could you talk maybe, Peter, a little bit about the biggest drivers quarterover quarter? Because obviously there\u2019s a substantial ramp coming and is itmore Mac or iPod or anything you can give us? Because it\u2019s a big increase.\nPeter Oppenheimer: It is and as we\u2019ve said before, the holiday quarter isusually the big quarter for iPods and as I said, we\u2019re shipping the best iPodsthat we\u2019ve ever made and are looking forward to the December quarter.\nShannon Cross - CrossResearch: Okay, and then maybe if you could talk a little bit aboutthe ramp in iPhone through the quarter? Obviously a pick-up as you lowered theprice, Any more color you can give us there?\nTimothy D. Cook: Shannon, we certainly saw sales accelerate after the pricereduction and as Peter mentioned earlier, we were able to sell 1.1 million forthe quarter, giving us a cumulative number of 1.4, and so we were very happy tocheck that major checkpoint off our list.\nShannon Cross - CrossResearch: Okay, and then just one final question; maybe you could talka little bit about efforts you have to address the SMB channel, both with Macsand iPhone? Just curious if that\u2019s helping to ramp and if any specifics you cangive us.\nTimothy D. Cook: The SMB market is difficult to measure. However, in terms ofwhat we can see operating out of our online stores and out of our retailstores, we are doing well there and growing. In terms of iPhone, you know, we\u2019ve said many times that weare providing a solution in iPhone that many businesses love. It gives thepeople a desktop class e-mail, which is very unusual for a phone and is anunprecedented Internet device. And I think clearly there are some businessesbuying them and very much enjoying them.\nShannon Cross - CrossResearch: Are you working with Salesforce.com on their initiative tomodify their software for iPhone?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes.\nShannon Cross - CrossResearch: Okay, great. Thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Andrew Neff of Bear Stearns.\nAndrew Neff - BearStearns: Thanks. Just a couple of things; one, if you could clarify,Peter, what you were saying about the tax rate this quarter. Is it anythingthat we\u2019ll see again next year? Maybe give us a sense of the guidance for nextyear? Second, I guess Tim, if you\u2019d like, you told us when youthought you shipped the millionth iPod. Any sense of when you are going to shipthe three-millionth iPhone -- I\u2019m sorry, iPhone?\nTimothy D. Cook: I\u2019ll start with that one. The answer is we are notpredicting, Andy. I would reiterate that we are very confident with shipping 10million in the calendar year of next year. We are very happy to ship ourone-millionth and by the end of the quarter, 1.4. I think it\u2019s interesting to note that the 1.4 million, ittook us over 24 months, over two years to achieve a comparable number on iPodand so we\u2019re thrilled here. We\u2019ve very focused on going into the U.K. andGermany on early, in early November and then in France in late November andwe\u2019re on target to enter Asia in calendar 2008. A lot of focus on iPhone.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Andy, to your tax rate question, the tax rate in theSeptember quarter was about 27%, which was lower than our anticipated 32%,primarily due to a benefit from prior year audits that we had. And as I gaveyou in my guidance, I expect the tax rate to return to 32% in the Decemberquarter.\nAndrew Neff - BearStearns: Also, could you just give a sense about Japan? That\u2019s theone market that seems to be, on the Mac side, lagging and that\u2019s been laggingfor some time. You\u2019ve talked about the market growth issues before. Anythingelse going on in Japanthat you could talk about?\nTimothy D. Cook: Andy, it\u2019s fair to say that Japan continues to be our mostchallenging major market. It is the only market that we -- a major market thatwe\u2019re not growing significantly in. However, for this past quarter, we werevery encouraged with the Macintosh results. The iMac was very well-received andthe overall Macintosh had its best year-over-year performance in Japan in sevenquarters, with units up 14% year over year and that compared to an IDC estimateof the market in Japan contracting an additional 2%. So it\u2019s a tough market. In terms of revenue, the revenue that you see on the sheet,the iPod had a very difficult compare because we sold a very large number toone telecom company for promotional purposes a year ago, so that was the maindriver in the revenue decline.\nAndrew Neff - BearStearns: Lastly, Peter, over the last I guess eight quarters, you\u2019veexceeded guidance. And I know that you are trying to give us a good sense ofwhat is going to happen, but how should we interpret now you are looking at avery strong quarter, you\u2019re a little above where the street is. How should wecalibrate your guidance at this point?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Andy, I give you guidance each quarter that we believe wehave a reasonable chance of achieving, and I\u2019ve talked to you about our view ofhow we are performing in our product areas and Tim has made some comments insome of our distribution areas as well. And we are very confident in ourstrategy and the team here at Apple has been working incredibly hard for anumber of years and things are just really coming together quite well for usand I couldn\u2019t be happier.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Andy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Harry Blount from Lehman Brothers.\nHarry Blount - LehmanBrothers: Thanks. Peter, just sorry to keep coming back to this rebatequestion, but it sounds like you are going to recognize that rebate as a periodimpact on COGS, but I think you are recognizing the rest of COGS on the iPhoneover a 24-month amortization. Is that -- am I hearing that correctly?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes, as regard the iPhone $100 credit. We will account forit when customers redeem their credit. We will charge it to the cost of theproduct to cost of goods sold, and we expect most of the redemptions to occurby the end of the December quarter.\nHarry Blount - LehmanBrothers: Just to clarify though, why are you doing the rebate as aperiod cost, whereas the rest of COGS for the iPhone is more amortized over the24 months?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. The credit was an additional but unspecified productdeliverable to iPhone customers, which is why we are not accounting for beforeit was redeemed but accounting for it at the point of redemption.\nHarry Blount - LehmanBrothers: Okay, and then on the European carrier revenue rec, is thatalso going to be structurally similar to the AT&T revenue rec in terms ofwhat the components that are period costs versus the components that are amortizationcosts?\nPeter Oppenheimer: In terms of payments that we may receive from Europeancarriers?\nHarry Blount - LehmanBrothers: Just the handset amortized over 24 months, the accessoriesrecognized in the period, and the payments. Is it that same structure?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We will recognize the revenue from handsets over 24 months,regardless of where they are sold. We will recognize revenue from iPhoneaccessories at the time of sale, and we will recognize payments from AT&Tand other carriers as revenue over time as earned.\nHarry Blount - LehmanBrothers: Okay. Tim, real quickly, just a benchmark on the number ofMac distribution locations, the number of iPod locations?\nTimothy D. Cook: We\u2019re over 40,000 on iPod and within the last year, we\u2019veadded about 2,000 Mac locations, to around 8,700 currently.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Harry. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi -Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. I\u2019m trying to get a better sense of howsignificant elasticity was around the price cut with the iPhone. My sense wasobviously in Q2, you did 135,000 phones a day. In -- excuse me, in Q3. In thispast quarter, you were probably doing 5,000 to 10,000 phones a day before youcut the price, and then you averaged about 18,500 phones after you cut theprice on the iPhone per day. Can you give us a sense of what the trajectory ofdaily sales volumes was from the iPhone immediately following the price cut andthen how that ended 22 days later at the end of the quarter? Was it relativelyconstant? Did it actually get better as the word leaked out? Can you give us asense of that? Because clearly when you initially announced the product, youhad a strong deceleration from enormous anticipation to when you cut the price.\nTimothy D. Cook: Toni, we were very happy with the elasticity that we saw. Itenabled us to far surpass our expectation of hitting around a million unitscumulatively by the end of the quarter. Some number of these were sold topeople that have an intention to unlock and where we don\u2019t know precisely howmany people are doing that, our current guess is there is probably 250,000 ofthe 1.4 million that we sold where people had bought them with the intention ofdoing that. Many of those happened after the price cut. We\u2019re not going to project precise numbers, as I told Andybefore, in terms of as we go into Q1, but we remain very confident with hitting10 million units in calendar year 2008.\nToni Sacconaghi -Sanford Bernstein: And can you give me a sense of the daily sales rateimmediately following the price cut versus the daily sales rate, either at theend of the quarter or over the last week? Has it been maintained or have weseen -- have we seen an acceleration or a degradation in that daily sales rate?\nTimothy D. Cook: The only thing that I\u2019ll say, Toni, is we obviously saw anacceleration once we took the price cut. We\u2019re not going to get into disclosingour daily sales.\nToni Sacconaghi -Sanford Bernstein: And then, you raised the issue of the unlock intention. Ipresume that phones that are sold that ultimately are not subscribed to theAT&T network are not eligible for any payments from AT&T, correct?\nTimothy D. Cook: That\u2019s correct. The payments on AT&T depend on beinglocked to AT&T, obviously.\nToni Sacconaghi -Sanford Bernstein: And then in terms of thinking about next quarter, the cellphone market is modestly seasonal. Typically your Mac business has been flat toslightly up and in Q1, your iPod business has been up 100% or more. The phonemarket tends to be up about 15% or so as a market. Is that how you areanticipating, all else being equal, obviously you\u2019re entering three newcountries this quarter, but if we think about how you guys think aboutseasonality, do you think this might be more or less seasonal, given its pricepoint, than the typical phone market? And how do we think about that?\nTimothy D. Cook: Well, in the phone market for our phone estimate, we lookedat the three new markets that we are going into for the first time and so thathad a lot to do with our own internal estimate. And then we looked at theseasonality of the phone market as well in the U.S.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Rob Semple of Credit Suisse. Mr. Semple,your line is open.\nNancy Paxton: Rob, are you there? Could we move on to the next caller,please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go Mike Abramsky from RBC Capital Markets. Hearingno response, we\u2019ll move to our next question. We\u2019ll go to Keith Bachman fromBank of Montreal. Hearing no response, we\u2019ll move on to Bill Fearnley of FTNMidwest.\nBill Fearnley - FTNMidwest: Hi, at Apple, can you guys hear us? This is Bill Fearnley.Can you hear me? Because you missed Rob Semple, you missed some of the otherguys as well. Am I connected?\nNancy Paxton: Yes, we can hear you.\nBill Fearnley - FTNMidwest: Okay, we just skipped over three of my colleagues so there\u2019sa problem with the conference call bridge. A quick question for you, if Icould, on the iPhone; in terms of the iPhone, Tim, last call you had mentionedthat you had had a couple of corporate customers that were piloting the iPhonein the enterprise. Anything you can share there for an update? Also, any update on any cannibalization that you are seeingwith the iPhone versus the iPod? And then also, on pilots, if I missed it inthe preamble, I apologize, but are there any updates on the pilot with Circuit City? Thanks.\nTimothy D. Cook: On Circuit City, we\u2019re not doing a pilot with Circuit City.We are focusing on expanding with Best Buy. I had mentioned the numbers on thatearlier. We ended with 230 Best Buy stores and expect to be north of 270 by theend of the quarter. All the iPhone customers are reporting incredible customersatisfaction and we\u2019ve achieved 95% of those who\u2019ve said that they wouldrecommend the phone to others and so I -- you know, these numbers areunprecedented in our history.\nBill Fearnley - FTNMidwest: But you had mentioned specifically enterprise test on theconference call last quarter. Any updates specifically on those enterprisetests that you were running now?\nTimothy D. Cook: No, I don\u2019t have any updates on those.\nBill Fearnley - FTNMidwest: Okay, and then in terms of cannibalization, any commentaryyou can give on cannibalization, iPhone, from the iPhone to the iPod, please?\nTimothy D. Cook: We saw no obvious cannibalization prior to the new iPodannouncement. Post the new iPod announcement, we really don\u2019t have enough datato comment yet. We will report again in January.\nBill Fearnley - FTNMidwest: Okay, and then one last question, if I could shift gears tothe Macintosh, please. In the pro segment, any update on what you\u2019ve seen interms of uplift from CS3 or some of the other new products that have goneuniversal binary? Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: We\u2019ve seen an incredible growth in our video business,driven by Final Cut Studio. We\u2019ve seen an incredible growth in our audiobusiness, driven by the new Logic software that we just put out. In the D&P space, the D&P space is slow. I think asbuyers evaluate changing to both CS3 and Leopard.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Rob Semple of Credit Suisse.\nRob Semple - CreditSuisse: Hey, it\u2019s Rob. Can you hear me now?\nNancy Paxton: We can hear you. Sorry about that.\nRob Semple - CreditSuisse: That\u2019s okay. No problem. A question on the iPod Touch and Iguess the iPhone; I know the price cut came about the same time as you launchedthe Touch. Did you see any potential cannibalization I guess away from theiPhone for people that opted for the lower price point of the Touch? I knowthat\u2019s difficult to quantify but just anecdotally, did any of your consumersurveys show that?\nTimothy D. Cook: Again, in terms of generically, we did -- we saw no obviousevidence of cannibalization from the iPhone to the iPod prior to the launch ofthe new product and since the launch of the new product, we really don\u2019t haveenough data. As you know, we were still in the early stages of rampingthe iPod Touch at the end of the quarter.\nRob Semple - CreditSuisse: Okay, and I apologize from this because I was cut off at thebeginning of the presentation, but did you give the CapEx number for thequarter? And then, your outlook for the fiscal year?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Rob, I didn\u2019t give the outlook. We\u2019ll do that when we fileour 10-K in a few weeks, but our capital in the quarter was $292 million and itwould have then been 822 for the year, for fiscal \u201907.\nRob Semple - CreditSuisse: Okay, and then just lastly, guys, what do you estimate thesize of the Mac installed base right now? And then, what percentage of thatinstalled base is on Tiger?\nTimothy D. Cook: Let me give you two numbers, which I think are the mostimportant to you. The vast majority of Macs shipped in the last four years areable to run Leopard. Specifically, this number is about 21 million. When weannounced Tiger, there were 15 million units that were eligible to run Tigerand we did $100 million of revenue on Tiger in the first quarter of launch.\nRob Semple - CreditSuisse: Okay. Thanks, Tim.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rob. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Mike Abramsky from RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Abramsky - RBCCapital Markets: Thanks. Can you hear me now?\nNancy Paxton: We can hear you.\nMike Abramsky - RBCCapital Markets: Excellent. Thank you. More of a high level question; couldyou just talk a little bit about the drivers that you were experiencing on Macmomentum and market share shifts? There\u2019s obviously several dimensions here --you\u2019ve got new buyers, new product lines, new distribution, new software. Canyou just give us a little color, perhaps, on which one of those are perhapsmost significant to some of the momentum that you are seeing, or perhaps theyall are, and some color on those that are being reflected into your guidance?\nTimothy D. Cook: We did have an incredible quarter on the Mac with breakingour previous Mac record by 400,000 units, and it was the end of an incredibleyear for the Mac because we did twice as many Macs as we did in 2004. We attribute this to one, the fact that we are shipping thebest Macs in the history of the company; and secondly, an incredible receptionthat we received to the new iMac that launched in August; third, we\u2019ve nowshipped over 120 million iPods, and most of these were shipped to Windowscustomers who never owned a Mac, so we introduced the Apple brand to them throughthe iPod. Net, you can see this as a result, over 50% of the Macs thatwe sold in our retail stores were to customers who never owned a Mac before sowe\u2019ve been very successful at expanding our customer base. And finally, this was the most successful back-to-schoolseason we have ever had. And so all of those together have led to acontinuation of a huge momentum that now gives us, adds up to 11 quarters outof the last 12 where we\u2019ve grown faster than the market and specifically, thelast several at a multiple of the market.\nMike Abramsky - RBCCapital Markets: Are there any risks of your scale? Obviously you\u2019ve had someadvantages that you\u2019ve touted over some of the larger competitors, includingthe lack of viruses, for example, on your operating system and your hardware,your ability to maintain a far more high touch buying experiences. Do you feelcomfortable that as you scale, you will be able to sustain these advantages?\nTimothy D. Cook: We have been growing a lot of the -- our NPD share is up to16% in the U.S., which is a terrific increase for us. But there is still a lotof room left for growth and as you know, we scaled iPod from being a fairlysmall business to the last holiday quarter, we sold 21 million iPods and we\u2019vesold over 120 million in total so far. We really have an experience at scalingthe product.\nMike Abramsky - RBCCapital Markets: Okay, and last question, you talked about the iPods shippingto Windows and that being a big driver obviously of Mac. In Europe, are youexpecting a similar halo effect due to iPhone sales there helping otherproducts further, like iPods and Macs?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re just launching in Europe onNovember 9th and so we\u2019ve got a lot to learn. However, I would point out thatour European business in the Mac area grew 47% year over year and this is overfour times IDC projection of growth for Western Europe, and so obviously thereis substantial evidence to say that the iPod has really helped us in Europe aswell.\nMike Abramsky - RBCCapital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman - Bankof Montreal: Hi, guys. Can you hear me now?\nNancy Paxton: We can hear you.\nKeith Bachman - Bankof Montreal: Okay, great. Related to the last comment, Tim, the othersegment in terms of unit growth had tremendous CPU unit growth, as did Europe.How do you think about expanding your channels in those categories, either onthe direct side or the indirect side, whether it be store openings or otherretail partnerships to continue to capture, or have the opportunity to capturesome of that growth?\nTimothy D. Cook: Keith, the other segment for us in particular is Asia-Pacific.It did grow 52% year over year. It is our fastest growing region, and as I\u2019vementioned earlier, we have added 2,000 store fronts to Mac distribution overthe last year and we are continuing to asses quality partners and quality storefronts to continue increasing that.\nKeith Bachman - Bankof Montreal: But of that amount of 2,000, I know on the direct side howmany you\u2019ve done, but can you give me any sense of what proportion are out ofthe U.S. geo of those 2,000?\nTimothy D. Cook: There are many of those that are in Asia and Europe -- manyof those.\nKeith Bachman - Bankof Montreal: Okay, let me ask two quickies, then; Tim, do you think --you\u2019ve obviously announced that you are going to do Asia-Pacific in terms ofthe iPhone. Do you think you can enter that market by having a 2.5G phone asopposed to a 3G phone?\nTimothy D. Cook: We have nothing to announce today in terms of our entry intoAsia other than to reaffirm our plans to enter in 2008.\nKeith Bachman - Bankof Montreal: Okay, the last one then, I just want to sneak one in; Peter,I was also one of the guys cut off at the beginning.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.  With that I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks. \nPeter Oppenheimer:  Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased to report strong financial results and another landmark quarter for Apple. Revenue of $5.41 billion was the highest in a June quarter in the history of Apple and represented 24% growth over the prior June quarter sales. The revenue was fueled by record-breaking Mac sales and continued strong demand for iPods.  Operating margin for the quarter was stronger than expected at 19.2%, resulting from higher than expected revenue and the continued, very favorable commodity cost environment. We generated net income of $818 million, which was up 73% over the prior June quarter's results, and translated to earnings per share of $0.92.  I'd like to talk first about our Mac products and services, which represented 60% of our total quarterly revenue. We're extremely pleased to have shipped 1.76 million Macs, setting an all-time quarterly record for Apple and representing 33% growth over the year-ago quarter. Mac shipments in the U.S. grew by 32% year over year, representing over four times IDC's latest published growth estimate for the U.S. market in the June quarter. On a worldwide basis, Apple's growth rate was more than 2.5 times IDC\u2019s most recently published market growth rate for the quarter.  We announced and began shipping the new MacBook and MacBook Pro during the quarter. The MacBook Pro includes the industry's first LED display and demand for both products was very strong. Sales of Mac notebooks grew 42% year over year during the quarter and accounted for 64% of total Macs sold. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.  Now I'd like to discuss our music products and services which accounted for 40% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold 9.8 million iPods, representing 21% growth over the year ago quarter. We began and ended the quarter within our target of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory. We remain very pleased with iPod\u2019s strong leadership position and its 71.5 % share of the U.S. market for MP3 players based on the latest data published by NPD.  Other music revenue grew 33% year over year, once again fueled by very strong iTunes Store sales. NPD reported that iTunes became the third largest overall music retailer in the U.S., surpassing Amazon and Target. We also launched iTunes Plus DRM-free music tracks in the quarter.  The iPhone was on sale for the last 30 hours of the quarter ending June 30th. During the quarter we sold a total of 270,000 iPhones to AT&T and through our Apple retail stores; and 146,000 iPhones were activated by Apple and AT&T. We did have some activation problems during the first week or so, and we would like to apologize to those customers who had less than a perfect activation experience. Since then AT&T has corrected the most common cause of these difficulties and we are now experiencing a very high percentage of problem-free activations.  Customers are clearly loving their iPhones. You may have read some of the surveys that have been conducted by independent research firms. One of them quoted in the USA Today on July 12th stated that 90% of iPhone owners surveyed said they were extremely or very satisfied with their phone; and 85% said they were extremely or very likely to recommend the device to others.  Based on surveys like this and other overwhelmingly positive feedback we continue to receive, customers clearly agree with us that the iPhone is a revolutionary product. It took Apple seven quarters, almost two years, to sell our one millionth iPod. We hope to sell our one millionth iPhone by the end of its first full quarter ending September 29th. We are on track to begin selling the iPhone in Europe during the fourth calendar quarter of this year, starting with a few major countries and expanding the number of countries throughout 2008. We will announce our initial plans with our European partners later this quarter.  Finally, we reiterate our goal of selling 10 million iPhones in calendar 2008.  As we discussed previously, we plan to build on today's tremendous iPhone foundation by incorporating new software features and applications into the iPhone over time at no charge to customers. As a result, we have adopted subscription accounting for the iPhone handset sales and are recognizing the associated revenue and cost of goods sold over 24 months.  Total revenue recognized from iPhone and iPhone accessory sales during the June quarter was $5 million. We did not recognize any revenue related to payments from AT&T during the June quarter, but will begin to do so in the September quarter.  As we also discussed previously, we are using subscription accounting to recognize revenue from Apple TV sales. Total deferred revenue related to iPhone and Apple TV sales was $180 million at the end of the June quarter, as shown in the schedule included with today's earnings press release.  I'd like to now turn to the Apple retail stores. The stores offer customers a great experience for buying Macs, iPods and now iPhones. As we contemplate iPhone sales through our stores that will result in significant amounts of deferred revenue and cost of goods sold, we revisited how we measure our store's performance.  Since the store's inception, operating income for our retail segment reflected cost of sales for Apple products at amounts normally charged for the same products to Apple's major U.S. channel partners operating retail stores, less the cost of sales programs and incentives provided to those partners. We believe this enabled us to measure the store's performance in a way that would allow comparability to the performance of those resellers.  Today, with more than six years of retail operating history and given the subscription accounting for the iPhone, we have determined that it is the right time to begin measuring our retail segment's operating performance in a manner that is generally consistent with the way we measure Apple's other operating segments.  Therefore, beginning with the June quarter, we are using cost of sales for Apple's products sold through our retail stores that are similar to those used for Apple's other operating segments.  We are also changing the way we measure AppleCare and .Mac sales through our retail stores. Historically, revenue and cost of sales were recognized by the retail segment at the time of the sale for AppleCare and .Mac. We are now recognizing revenue and cost for these products over the lives of their respective agreements, consistent with the accounting treatment in our other segments. We believe all these changes will allow greater comparability of results between our various operating segments.  Now let's discuss our retail stores results for the quarter, which were outstanding. Based on the accounting I just discussed, sales were $915 million, representing 33% year-over-year growth. The stores generated $184 million in segment margin compared to $122 million in the year ago quarter.  We remodeled 15 stores and opened eight new stores during the quarter, ending with 185 stores. With an average of 180 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5.1 million compared to $4.7 million in the year-ago quarter.  The stores sold 330,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 53% year-over-year growth. Once again, over 50% of the customers buying Macs in our stores during the quarter were new to the Mac.  Approximately 21.9 million people visited our stores during the quarter, representing over 9,000 customers per store per week. The stores launched our new one-to-one initiative during the quarter and we now have over 270,000 members in this program.  It was also a great quarter for Apple's U.S. education channel, which set a new all-time record for quarterly Mac sales. Our education one-to-one and new account initiatives help drive significant growth during the quarter, with MacBook sales particularly strong in both K to 12 and high-end markets.  Total company gross margin was 36.9%, higher than our guidance, primarily due to favorable commodity costs, a different product pricing environment from what we expected, a more favorable product mix, and a greater mix of direct sales.  Operating expenses were $954 million including $55 million in stock-based compensation expense. We capitalized $26 million of software development expense during the quarter.  OI&E was $155 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 32%. We had strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance to end with over $13.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was over $1.2 billion.  Looking ahead to the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.  For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $5.7 billion. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately $69 million. We expect gross margin to be about 29.5%, reflecting approximately $10 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We are guiding gross margin down sequentially as a result of the back-to-school promotion, higher commodity costs, and product transitions.  We expect OpEx to be about $990 million, including about $59 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $165 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%. We expect to generate EPS of about $0.65, including an anticipated $0.05 per share related to non-cash stock-based compensation expense.  In closing, we're very pleased with the results of the June quarter. Quarterly Mac shipments broke the previous company record by more than 150,000 systems and we feel very positive about our momentum heading into the back-to-school season. We're off to a great start with the iPhone and are continuing to invest in the business for long-term growth in revenue and earnings.  With that, I'd like to open the call to questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) First up today is Ben Reitzes with UBS. \nBen Reitzes - UBS: Peter, with regard to guidance, you just guided $0.66 and came up with $0.92. Why should we believe that this is $0.65 this time when you have been so conservative? Are you really that worried about the component costs, or is there something else going on with regard to an upcoming price cut for a product? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, we gave you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. Regarding the gross margin, I have guided it down to 29.5% as a result primarily of three factors. We\u2019re going to run the back-to-school promotion for most of the quarter, a great promotion for the company and brings us each year many new customers, but it is an expensive one. We do expect to see higher commodity costs and I will let Tim comment on that in a moment; and we have some product transitions that I can\u2019t get into. \nBen Reitzes - UBS: Well, I am sure someone will ask the component question. Can you give us any more flavor on the iPhones, perhaps how many have been sold to date? What do you think of various reports and chatter out there? This is a new frontier for us as analysts and we\u2019re trying to navigate all the headwinds and tailwinds. Can you give us any more commentary as to what you think demand is like right now as you see it and how it should build into year end and how we fight this battle as investors and trying to match the hype? \nTimothy Cook: Let me take this one. As Peter said in his opening comments, we sold 270,000 units in the first 30 hours. AT&T said that more iPhones were sold in the first weekend than they have sold in the first month of any other wireless device in their entire history. More important than this, customers love their iPhones. As Peter mentioned in this opening comments, with a recent survey finding that a stunning 90% of iPhone owners were extremely or very satisfied with the iPhone.  So our view is the starting gun has been fired and we have gotten off to a great start. However, our primary focus is not on initial sales. We are focused on building a third great business for Apple over the long term, alongside our Mac and iPod businesses, both of which you can see from the results reported today are doing very well.  It won\u2019t be easy to build the third business because the competitors are large and entrenched and it will not be done overnight. Our perspective is measured in years not months, but the rewards, we believe, are huge for Apple. Apple clearly has the skills including world-class hardware and software engineering that make us confident that we can succeed.  As Peter mentioned earlier, our next step is to begin selling the iPhone in Europe next quarter starting with a few major countries and then expand over the whole of 2008. We hope to, as a result of this and other things, we hope to grow our sales step by step, year by year and model my model, just like we have done in the prior product lines.  I do think it\u2019s interesting to note that it took Apple seven quarters -- almost two years -- to sell our one millionth iPod. We hope to sell our one millionth iPhone in the first full quarter of sale. What we have seen so far gives us a lot of confidence to reiterate our goal to sell 10 million units across 2008. \nBen Reitzes - UBS: Do you see any shortages out there for components for the iPhone, and then I will cede the floor, here. \nTimothy Cook: Ben today, almost all AT&T stores and Apple retail stores have the iPhone in stock. We are shipping units off of Apple.com in one to two days. We have obviously included our view of longer-term supply and demand in our projections. \nOperator: Next up we have a question from Shannon Cross - Cross Research. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Peter you had discussed in your remarks no payment from AT&T this quarter. Is there anything you can give us to clarify that comment and why there wouldn\u2019t be any in this quarter versus coming in next quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Shannon, I really can\u2019t go beyond it. We are not discussing the terms of the agreement but again, we will recognize payments from AT&T as revenue over time as earned. We did not recognize any revenue related to the payments from AT&T during the June quarter but will begin to do so in the September quarter. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Looking at what you provided us on the deferred revenue and as Ben said, we are all starting to try to work through this, is it fair to take the $180 million of deferred revenue, both short and long term that is on your books, give it some haircut for Apple TV; divide by 270,000 units and come up with a per unit contribution? I hate doing this on a call, but... \nPeter Oppenheimer: You mean in terms of you\u2019re trying to get the ASP? What do you mean ? \nShannon Cross - Cross Research:  Well I was trying to figure out if there was anything in there other than just the ASP that is running through that line, or is that pretty much all we\u2019re seeing right now? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Shannon, for both the current and the long-term deferred revenue it is just the hardware revenue for both iPhone and Apple TV. So there aren\u2019t accessories or anything else that is in there. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Finally just given the fact that obviously cash was $1.2 billion this quarter and cash is going to become so important now that we are all looking at the deferred part of the business and how you are running it. Have you given any thought to providing cash flow guidance per share? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Not on this call. We are going to continue to report to you in each of our calls what our cash flow from operations was. We have traditionally not forecasted or provided any guidance on balance sheet items and I am not sure I see that changing. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Just on the gross margin side, I know Ben asked about it, but looking back historically there has been sort of 100 to 200 basis points decrease from the June quarter to September quarter and obviously you are forecasting a much bigger one; and you have had basically the iPod promotion in place for last couple of quarters. Is there anything in there we should really focus on in terms of a change from the prior years that would lead you to go down to 29.5% gross margin? \nPeter Oppenheimer: I am not really sure, Shannon, that prior year comparisons are a great way to always look at gross margins. We tend to think about them and I talk to you about them on the call on a more sequential basis.  In terms of the back-to-school promotion, we began the promotion in about the middle of June so we had a couple of weeks of it in the June quarter. But we\u2019re going to see it pretty much the whole way through the September quarter. That, along with the commodity cost prices going up that we\u2019re seeing and some product transitions that I can\u2019t get into are the primary drivers of the sequential decrease in the gross margin that I have guided to. \nOperator: From Piper Jaffray is Gene Munster. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray : I know you talked a little bit about the AT&T relationship and the accounting on that. Peter, is there any sort of just very big picture thoughts you can give us on how to model that revenue share between Apple and AT&T? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, I am sorry. I just am not in a position at this point to go into it really in more detail. Again we did not record any revenue from the June quarter payments from AT&T. We did obviously sell iPhones and we will recognize payments from AT&T as revenue over time, as earned. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray : Can you say if the payments from AT&T will be recognized over a two-year period in the life of the contract? Is that the right way to think about it? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t answer that question at this time. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray : Just in terms of the iPhone, I am totally on board with your message that this is going to take some time to ramp, and ultimately it is going to be game-changing. In the near term, as we are all, as we have talked about, getting our arms around how to model this, how do you think about that initial wave of tech nerds that go out and buy the device and that 730,000 estimate that you gave for the September quarter. Are you kind of looking at the current run rate after we had the initial bubble or do you think that bubble is still going on?  I just want to make sure that people get their expectations in check over the next couple of quarters versus couple of years? \nTimothy Cook: We feel like we have given quite a bit on this. As I said before, we did 270,000 in the 30 hours last quarter. We expect to sell the one millionth iPhone by the end of September and what we have seen so far gives us a lot of confidence that across 2008 week can sell 10 million iPhones. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray : So the 730 number that you are looking at for the September quarter, I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but is that an existing run rate or is that extrapolating those first couple of days or any thoughts on that? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We hope to sell the one millionth one by the end of September. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Bailey - Goldman Sachs. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Good afternoon. In addition to the payments that you\u2019re getting from AT&T, are you receiving any fees from the other vendors that have placement for their services on the main screen of the iPhone? \nPeter Oppenheimer: David, we don\u2019t discuss the terms of various agreements that we have with vendors and suppliers. I am sorry, we can\u2019t answer that question. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: So you can\u2019t even answer if you are or if you are not? \nPeter Oppenheimer: No. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then in your gross margin commentary, you said that was different pricing in the quarter than you expected, is that right? If you could give a little more clarification on that? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure, we experienced a more stable pricing environment for some of our hardware products than we had provided for in the guidance. That was a positive, and we also saw a more favorable product mix, which to some degree went hand-in-hand with the higher direct sales when we sell, particularly on the online stores and in the retail stores, we tend to see a better product mix across the product line. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Richard Gardner - Citigroup. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Tim, could you give us an update on the Best Buy roll out and how that\u2019s coming? How many stores you were in at the beginning of the quarter and how many stores exiting the quarter and whether that was a material contributor to the Mac unit shipment number in the quarter? \nTimothy Cook: Richard at the beginning of the quarter we were around 50, by the end of the quarter we were around 75. By the end of this quarter we will be over 200 and we expect to be almost at 300 by the end of the calendar year. So it\u2019s going very well, both parties are very happy about it and that\u2019s the reason we are expanding. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: I will ask the component question, Tim. I was just hoping maybe you could give us a sense of what was better than expected in the second quarter and how you see component prices trending for the categories in the third quarter? \nTimothy Cook: Yes, sure. Component prices, particularly DRAM which bottomed in the quarter later than we predicted and lower than we predicted, both of those led component prices in general to be more favorable than we predicted and this contributed to the higher than expected gross margins that Peter has talked about.  In terms of going forward, as you know historically in the second half of the year, the commodity markets tighten as the industry heads into a seasonally stronger demand period, and I don\u2019t envision this year being fundamentally different.  Specifically, we see the NAND flash market tightening, we expect DRAM to stabilize from its recent over supply state; and on LCDs, a fundamental lack of new capacity investment combined with flat-panel TV demand is creating a greater than typical imbalance between supply and demand. For other commodities, we expect them to follow more historic trends. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Tim, if I could follow up. Did pre-buys or forward purchases on NAND during the first calendar quarter contribute meaningfully to the gross margin upside in the second quarter? \nTimothy Cook: Rich, I don\u2019t want to go into that level of detail. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Can you comment on whether your 270,000 iPhone shipments include shipments to the channel? That being AT&T stores. If so, how many iPhones were in inventory at the end of the quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We did ship some of the 270,000 iPhones to AT&T, and as they indicated, most of their stores were stocked out during the initial launch. However, there would have been some inventory in transit to AT&T at the end of the quarter. \nOperator: We have a question now from Richard Farmer at Merrill Lynch. \nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Just a couple of clarifications. I think you pretty clearly answered that you didn\u2019t receive payments from AT&T in the quarter, and I think you said that you will not in the deferred revenue on the balance sheet have anything but iPhone hardware and Apple TV hardware. I just want to confirm that you don\u2019t anticipate any of the AT&T payments ever ending up as a deferred item? They will always be simply recognized like normal revenue. Is that a fair interpretation? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Richard, my comment was regarding the June quarter within the $180 million that was hardware revenue only from iPhone and Apple TV, it did not include any accessory revenue or payments from AT&T.  We will record, as I said, the payments from AT&T as revenues over time as earned, and I will talk to you about next quarter when we report to you our deferred revenue at the end of the September quarter, if it included any payments from AT&T. \nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: You will clarify next quarter within the deferred revenue balance or the just regular recognized revenue from these payments from AT&T then? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes I will. \nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: But certainly the possibility there is open. You\u2019re not categorically saying that it won\u2019t end up that way? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Not making a comment at this point. We will report to you next quarter\u2019s results in October. \nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Just a broader question about the iPhone price points over time. If we look at the history of your iPod business, you started at higher price points then ultimately had a broad line all the way down to Shuffle at $79. Obviously the first iPhone is at $500 or $600. Should we reasonably assume that over time you will have a broader line and lower price points and a family of phones to choose from? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We don\u2019t really comment on our product plan, but we believe the iPhone offers tremendous value that customers couldn\u2019t even have imagined before. As you know, this is really three products in one; it\u2019s a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen iPod, and Internet in your pocket with the best, desktop class e-mail, web browsing and map applications ever on a mobile phone before. We think customers are clearly seeing that, as witnessed by the customer satisfaction ratings that we talked about. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Semple - Credit Suisse. \n Rob Semple - Credit Suisse: In the context of top line growth, can you just walk us through how you think about seasonality in both the iPod and the Mac businesses for September? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Let me begin with Mac. The June quarter begins the education buying season. Sequential seasonality from June to September has been mixed. Some years have experienced a slight increase and some years have experienced a slight decrease.  For iPods, in terms of assessing MP3 seasonality, we have learned over the last few years that what drives the market to new levels is innovative product launches and seasonal buying in the holiday, December quarter. Last year, iPod sales were up about 8% from June to September, driven by the new suite of iPods and iPod Nanos that we introduced in September. \n Rob Semple - Credit Suisse: Peter, do you worry about any sort of slowdown or pause in front of Leopard? I know historically you haven\u2019t really seen that in the Mac business ahead of OS 10 launches, but anything different with an installed base that tends to be more heavily weighed towards traditional Windows users? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We will have to see what happens, but I would point out that this past quarter is the highest Mac sales the company ever had and the Macs we are shipping today are the absolute best products we have ever shipped.  Also, the upgrade process is very, very straightforward and simple. \n Rob Semple - Credit Suisse: I know it\u2019s very early, but have you seen any evidence of iPod cannibalization from iPhone? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We saw absolutely no obvious evidence during the June quarter. We will obviously monitor that this quarter and report this quarter in the October conference call. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Bear Stearns\u2019 Andrew Neff. \nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Two things. One of the comments, you have seen a lot of reviews about the issue about corporate email. Are there thoughts relative to the phone about trying to address that market? Have you had any discussions with some of the major providers of corporate email along those lines or thought about how you can try to address that corporate market?  The second was just again to clarify in terms of the accounting treatment, relative to what you are going to recognize in the deferred revenues going forward, can you clarify for us what you are going to put in there? \nPeter Oppenheimer: In terms of the corporate market, we think the iPhone is a breakthrough product for all customers, including business customers. It\u2019s a great Internet device that includes the best email client out there with the best web-browser ever on a mobile device. With a very little bit of help from the corporate IT department, it can be set up to work with corporate email. We already have a number of corporate customers that are piloting the iPhone in their enterprises and they have told us that they are very happy with the results so far. \nGary Wipfler: With regard to your deferred revenue question, we provided to you the deferred revenue schedule this quarter. For iPhone and Apple TV it has $180 million of total deferred revenue which again related only to the hardware from the iPhone and from Apple TV, so there was no accessories revenue included in this or payments from AT&T.  We will provide a similar schedule to you in October to the September quarter and I will walk you through then how the various revenue streams impacted the financials. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - Banc Of America. \nKeith Bachman - Banc of America: Peter, on the CPUs, a healthy growth. The retail, which is moved around a little bit was really the standout this quarter in terms of unit growth rates for CPUs, and Japan again was weak. Could you offer a little color what was going on in retail that caused it to be such a standout this quarter and any kind of expectations given the brand awareness that iPhone is creating? Would you expect that to help us for the retail CPU business as we look forward to the September quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer: The retail stores had an outstanding quarter. The revenue was up in total 33%, Mac shipments were up 53% and 24% on a per store basis. We are seeing very strong traffic through the stores, clearly selling a lot of Macs and other products. There is tremendous interest in the phone and I think the stores has benefited from all three of our product areas and are seeing very strong traffic interest and the results have been just tremendous. \nKeith Bachman - Banc of America: Peter, could you give us some updated commentary on expectations if you can on store openings as you look out over the next couple of quarters? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We expect to open 12 stores in the September quarter to end of year with 197 and we have not set a target yet for fiscal \u201808 openings, I will share those with you in October. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Peter, you\u2019re using period accounting on the iPhone launch for the expenses incurred in the quarter. Could you give us a sense of how much those were within the OpEx line? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Harry, I will talk more qualitatively. We certainly provided some extra staffing in our stores for the launch and for our online stores and our support areas. I think you saw tremendous marketing in advertising from the company on iPhone, so we certainly saw added expenses.  As you indicated and we had discussed before we are taking the operating expense related to iPhone as period expense while recognizing the revenue over 24 months. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Could you give us a sense of Apple TV units? They are not discreetly broken out here. \nPeter Oppenheimer: We don\u2019t announce that level of product detail. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Okay, but it\u2019s not included in the iPhone numbers, correct? \nPeter Oppenheimer: It is not, it\u2019s a separate category. It\u2019s reported in the other music category as an accessory. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Your cash assets currently account for about two-thirds of your total assets. I am wondering if we still have any change in thinking about the use of cash? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We still discuss this with the board from time to time, but don\u2019t have a change to share with you today. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Lastly, coming back to the gross margin guidance Peter, if I just do a simple math on the numbers, it basically says you\u2019re looking for about a $600 million absolute sequential increase in COGS relative to the revenue. Even with the back-to-school promotions and perhaps product transitions, relative to the sales of hardware that\u2019s still an awful large number.  Can you may be help with that again because the math doesn\u2019t seem to work real well unless you have a massive spike in commodity prices or unless you significantly cut the cost of your average CPU? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Harry, I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s not a question I think I\u2019m really going to be able to answer for you this quarter, we will talk to you about it next quarter. I have shared with you the three primary factors that will cause our gross margin to decline sequentially, and all three are going to contribute. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley. \n Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Just a follow-up on the component discussion, how should we think about your ability to leverage the prepaid NAND Flash that sits on your balance sheet from 2005 as that market becomes tighter in the back half of the year? \nPeter Oppenheimer: T hat was a very strategic investment for us and we are even more sure today that it was the right approach for us than we were then as we begin to use more and more flash in all of our products, including now the iPhone. \n Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley : And then on MAC front, consumer MAC units obviously very strong again this quarter, but it also looks like desktop units and ASPs are stronger than expected. Did you in fact see a good acceleration on the commercial side of the business post the April product announcement? \nPeter Oppenheimer: It was an overall blowout quarter for the Mac. It was the absolute best quarter we have ever had. We sold more portables than we ever had, we\u2019ve sold more total units than we ever had. The education market was the best education quarter we have ever had, and also to answer your question, the pro business had a nice uptick as we shipped a new version of Final Cut Studio and Adobe shipped Creative Suite 3. So really, all of the markets really kicked in nicely this quarter. \nOperator: From RBC Capital Markets this is Michael Abramsky. \n Michael Abramsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. Are you expecting a similar reception in Europe when you launch the iPhone? It is a little bit the different market, so could you just tell us a little bit how you approach the market? I think 3G is perhaps a little bit more important and obviously competitors like Nokia and other are very entrenched there? \nPeter Oppenheimer: The way that we look at this is that the iPhone is a breakthrough product and we think it is great for Americans and Europeans and everyone else and in all markets, and so we are very excited to get going there, are spending a lot of energy on this and later in the quarter we will be announcing some details about which carriers we will be working with. \n Michael Abramsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Is there any high level commentary you can make? I think going into the launch of the iPhone you did talk about some of the learning experiences that you plan to have, just on issues of pricing, reaction to consumer pricing, network speed, is there anything surprising that you have adapted to, either positively or negatively, that have come from the early experiences you\u2019ve had with sales? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We have only been at this for a few weeks. We are very much beginners at this and so everyday there is something to learn. Again, we are very focused on building the business over the very long term and we are looking forward to taking the next step with expanding geographically into Europe next quarter. \nOperator: Next is Bill Fearnley, FTN Midwest. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Switching gears here back to Macintosh if I could. You talked about the effect of product transitions potentially on gross margins here for the upcoming quarter. Is there going to be any effect potentially on revenue, revenue mix or revenue growth here? I mean, if you look at the product transition, again you\u2019ve talked about margins, but what about on the revenue side? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, I think that generally we are going to have to talk to you about that in 90 days. I did discuss some of the seasonality that we expect. We are in the back-to-school season. The June quarter tends to be more dominated by our K-12; higher ed is strong, but it tends to be a little bit K-12 focused whereas in the September quarter it tends to be a bit more high ed focused. I have walked you through what we have traditionally seen for iPods in the September quarter. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Also on the direct mix, you said that direct was helping margins. Could you give us the direct versus indirect mix for the quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer: In the June quarter of this year, it was 53% of revenue and that was up from 49% in the year-ago quarter. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: One last question on the component side, any issues with availability during the quarter or any issues with availability of components in the quarter that we are currently in for 4Q? Thanks. \nTimothy Cook: For the last quarter, we ended the channel inventory in the three to four-week range in the Mac. And as you know, that\u2019s outside of our range on the low side. We announced a new MacBook Pro in early June and we\u2019re not able to get enough inventory in the channel by the end of the quarter.  For this quarter, our view about supply and demand have been factored those in the revenue guidance that Peter has talked about. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: What about on the components side, any availability issues on components? \nTimothy Cook: Well, ultimately components are generally what drives the supply. So again, we factored our view of supply and demand into our guidance. \nOperator: From JP Morgan, this is Bill Shope. \nBill Shope - JP Morgan: Historically looking at the iPod business, we saw a very small incremental OpEx increased per dollar of iPod revenues and clearly this provided you with a lot of historical leverage. Can you give us any color on how we should think about the incremental OpEx that would be required for the iPhone going forward? Obviously I\u2019m only looking for qualitative color here. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, as I commented earlier, Bill, we are recording the OpEx for iPhone, whether it be R&D or sales and marketing or advertising as period expense. So we\u2019re taking that absent [ph] and spreading the revenue over a two-year period of time. So we are taking that and spreading the revenue over a two-year period of time. So in the early quarters of our iPhone sales when we are incurring the expense and we are beginning to sell iPhones, but again amortizing the revenue over 24 months, you really carry more of the expense burden. Over time, that relationship is going to change. \nBill Shope - JP Morgan: It may be too early for this question, but do you have any early demographic statistics on the iPhones buyers that you can share at this point? \nPeter Oppenheimer: In terms of demographic statistics, I don\u2019t, but again some of the market research that we have seen -- and one report in particular, it was quoted in the USA Today indicated that 90% of iPhone owners surveyed were extremely or very satisfied with their iPhones and 85% said they were extremely or very likely to recommend the iPhones to others. \nOperator: From W. R. Hambrecht this is Matt Kather. \n Matt Kather - W. R. Hambrecht: Could you disclose what the ASP for the iPhone was in the quarter or are we left to guess given the deferred statistics that you have disclosed? \nPeter Oppenheimer: More the latter. \n Matt Kather - W. R. Hambrecht: Any qualitative commentary on the 8 gig versus 4 gig? \nTimothy Cook: We don\u2019t disclose the specifics Matt, but I would tell you that the mix skewed to the 8 gig for early sales in June. \n Matt Kather - W. R. Hambrecht: On the margin profile for the iPhone, obviously you won\u2019t give it, but in the past you have said certain products are above your corporate average. Will you confirm if the iPhone\u2019s gross margins were about the corporate average for the June quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer: I am sorry, could you repeat the question? \n Matt Kather - W. R. Hambrecht: Just on the gross margin for iPhone, in the past you have said if products are above what your corporate average is or not. Will you confirm if the gross margin on the iPhone for June is above your gross margin corporate average? \nPeter Oppenheimer: While we are off to a great start with iPhone and sold 270,000 in the last 30 hours, the revenue contribution in the quarter was $5 million and the vast majority of that was accessories. So the impact to the quarter was very small. \n Matt Kather - W. R. Hambrecht: You guys are reiterating your goals 10 million units for \u201808 now. Should we assume this is only the European and U.S. markets that you have announced so far or does this include possible broader expansion of the phone internationally? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We plan to go into a few major countries in Europe next quarter; to move across other countries in Europe across 2008 and to enter Asia in 2008 as well. \n Matt Kather - W. R. Hambrecht: So that would include Asia. My last question is just on the Mac business, as you mentioned it was a terrific print for the quarter in the Mac business and you continue to grow as a multiple of both U.S. and worldwide growth. Given the fact that you have refreshes here, you have kept ASPs quite constant, do you have any market share aspirations? Or internally, what you guys think you can do vis-a-vis continuing to grow your market shares? We see you entering Best Buy and continue to do very well internationally as well. \nPeter Oppenheimer: We are focused on making the very best products and we believe if we do that then our share will rise. \n Matt Kather - W. R. Hambrecht: No specific or even qualitative goals that you might be able to share, where do you think you can take that? \nPeter Oppenheimer: No, we are not setting specific market share goals. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Matt.

We are pleased to report stellar financial results and another record-breaking quarter for Apple. The quarter\u2019s revenue was $7.12 billion, representing 24% growth over the prior December quarter\u2019s record results, which included a 14th week.  The revenue growth was driven by very strong iPod sales during the holiday season and continued robust demand for Macs. Operating margin for the quarter was exceptionally high at 18.6%, resulting from the revenue growth and effective cost management. We are particularly proud to have generated net income of $1 billion, which is up 78% over last year\u2019s record December quarter results, and translated to earnings per share of $1.14.  I would like to first talk abut our Mac products and services, which represented 43% of our total quarterly revenue. We shipped a total of 1.61 million Macs, consistent with the record-setting shipment in our September back-to-school quarter, and representing 28% growth over the 14-week year-ago quarter. We were very pleased with this growth, which was ahead of our expectations and represented about three times IDC\u2019s latest published market growth rate estimate for the December quarter.  Ending channel inventory of Macs was essentially unchanged from the prior quarter, and was just below our target range of four to five weeks.  We refreshed both the MacBook and MacBook Pro with Intel Core 2 Dual processors during the quarter, and customer demand for our portable Macs remained particularly strong.  Portable Mac shipments during the quarter grew 65% year over year and accounted for 60% of total Macs sold.  It was an outstanding quarter for our music products and services. They accounted for 57% of total revenue during the quarter versus 59% in the year-ago quarter. We sold 21.1 million iPods, representing 50% growth over the year-ago quarter. The new iPod Shuffle began shipping at the end of October and we were very pleased with the demand for all three of our iPod product lines during the quarter.  Channel inventory of iPods increased by about 200,000 units, all related to channel fill for the iPod Shuffle. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks on a look-forward basis.  We are happy that iPod maintained its leadership position in the U.S. in the face of increased competition. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was 72% in the month of December, according to NPD Techworld. iPod shipments grew even faster in international markets, which resulted in share gains in every country for which we have market data. This gives us confidence that our emphasis on advertising, channel development and improved supply in these markets has been effective.  Other music revenue grew 29% year over year, fueled by very strong sales through the iTunes store. The store\u2019s growing content offering now includes over 4 million songs, 350 television shows, and 250 movies. As we announced last week, we have now sold over 2 billion songs and have added feature films from Paramount Pictures to our movie library.  iTunes continues to lead the market for songs purchased and downloaded, accounting for over 85% of the U.S. market based on the latest data from Nielsen Soundscan. iTunes gift cards were immensely popular during the holiday quarter and doubled year over year.  Sales from our Apple retail stores were over $1.1 billion, the highest level in the store\u2019s history. The stores generated $89 million of segment margin, not including $232 million of associated manufacturing profit. We opened five new stores during the quarter to end with 170 stores. With an average of 169 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $6.7 million.  The stores sold 308,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 60% year-over-year growth. Almost 28 million people visited our stores during the quarter, representing 13,000 customers per store per week. We continue to invest in our stores to support customers and to showcase our products. The stores are a wonderful place to buy Macs today and we think they will provide customers a great experience with iPhone beginning in June.  Gross margin was 31.2%, almost 300 basis points higher than our guidance, primarily due to the favorable commodity pricing environment, better product mix, and greater leverage of fixed costs due to the higher-than-expected revenue.  Operating expenses were $898 million, including $40 million in expense related to stock-based compensation.  OI&E was $126 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 31%, slightly below our guidance of 32% due to the extension of the R&D tax credit associated with recent legislation. We expect the tax rate to be 32% for the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.  We had very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by over $1.75 billion to end with $11.9 billion. This was primarily a function of strong earnings and working capital management.  Looking ahead to the March quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.  For the quarter:  In closing, fiscal year 2007 is off to a tremendous start. We are incredibly proud to have just completed the first quarter with revenue of over $7 billion and net income of $1 billion. Last week at MacWorld, we introduced the revolutionary iPhone and Apple TV and we are very excited about the remarkable new products coming from Apple this year.  With that, I would like to open the call to questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions)  We go first today to Mr. Ben Reitzes with UBS. \nBenjamin Reitzes - UBS: Thanks, good afternoon. Peter, in your guidance, what are you factoring in, or are you factoring anything in, for any pause in demand ahead of the iPhone, perhaps in the iPod markets or anything? Also, what are you factoring in for seasonality in the iPod market? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We have factored our view of customer demand and supply into our guidance. As we have said, we just announced the iPhone last week and it is really too soon to tell, but we believe we have a great iPod product offering today, with a range of prices, capacities and form factors to meet many customers needs and uses. We may be in a position to share some observations with you next quarter.  In terms of seasonality from December to the March quarter, let me speak first about iPods and then I will make some comments about Mac.  For iPods, in terms of assessing the MP3 market seasonality, we have learned over the last few years that what really drives the MP3 market to new levels is innovative product launches and the holiday season buying in the December quarter. iPod demand this quarter was extraordinary. We were able to ship over 21 million units. Unlike the previous year, iPod supply and demand were largely in balance. Given this, we would expect a higher seasonal decline from the December quarter to the March quarter this year than we saw last.  For Macs, Apple does a significant percentage of its December quarter in the consumer segment and sequentially, we would expect to see the holiday buying season drop off and the education buying to begin to ramp up in the spring. \nBenjamin Reitzes - UBS: One last thing is just with regard to your stock option investigation. Have you received any commentary from the SEC or Justice Department? Are they happy with your findings? What do you expect to hear from them now, if anything? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We from the beginning have voluntarily and proactively provided all details of our internal review and the independent investigation to the SEC and the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California. The exhaustive and independent investigation found no misconduct by any member of Apple's current management team, and the Board has expressed complete confidence in the management team. \nBenjamin Reitzes - UBS: Okay, and so they still have no formal investigation and what not, and no comments from them, or else you would have to share them, correct? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We are continuing to voluntarily and proactively inform them of our findings and answer their questions. \nBenjamin Reitzes - UBS: Great, thanks, Peter. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: We go next now to Mr. Richard Gardner with Citigroup. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thank you. Peter, you mentioned a very favorable commodity environment when you did your gross margin discussion. Could you talk about which commodities in particular were more favorable than expected in the quarter? Could you give, Tim, please, your typical supply/demand outlook for the March quarter as well? Thank you. \nTim Cook: Sure, Rich. This is Tim. Last quarter, we saw favorable pricing across the board. It was a great time to be a buyer. For this quarter, we see that favorable pricing environment continuing on LCDs and Flash memory, and we believe that DRAM will be relatively supply/demand balanced. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: We go next now to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Yes, thank you. I have two questions. The stores\u2019 revenue collectively was up only 6%, despite the fact that CPU growth was up 60% and revenue was likely up 70%, implying a dramatic deceleration year over year in iPod unit shipments in the stores. Could you comment on why that happened? What we have been seeing, pretty well through history, is the stores have always grown faster than Apple overall. I think other than the Intel transition, this was the only time in history where that has not occurred. That clearly seems attributable to the iPod. Could you take me through why that might be? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure, Toni. The retail store revenue, as you said, grew 6% year over year as total Mac sales increased by 60%. This was partially offset by lower iPod revenue, which resulted from the price reductions that we took in September, and also our expanded and well-supplied distribution channel that we had this year. That was really the cause of it.  We were very pleased with the stores\u2019 performance. They are bringing many new customers to Apple and we think come June, they will sell a lot of iPhones. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Secondly, just to clarify your channel inventory comments, I am having trouble reconciling them. At the end of last quarter, you said iPod inventory, I gather on a consistent, look-forward basis, was in your range of four to six weeks. You are basically guiding for iPod revenues to be down more than 40%, units to be down more than 40% sequentially. So if your units are going to effectively be half and your inventory actually went up on a sequential basis, the number of units, and you were between four and six, how is it possible that you are not at least eight weeks of channel inventory at the end of this quarter on a look-forward basis? \nTim Cook: The difference between the beginning on-hand and the ending on-hand last quarter in the iPod space was only 200,000 units, so it was a very, very small increase and all of that was due to the Shuffle, which did not start shipping until October. So because we think demand will be higher than in Q4, which is the previous four to six week period, we are still within four to six on a look-forward basis in the January quarter. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Sorry, can you run that by me again? At the end of fiscal Q4, I thought on a look-forward basis you were four to six weeks on what will be double the volume. So if at the end of Q1 on a look-forward basis, you are still four to six weeks, then your volumes looking forward are going to be half, yet your inventory went up. How is that possible? \nTim Cook: The four to six weeks that you are quoting in Q4 was looking back. It was a backwards looking four to six weeks. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Thank you. \nTim Cook: Obviously, if you looked at, if we did a look-back basis on Q1, Tony, it would be one to two weeks. It would be a very, very small level of inventory, but that is an unrealistic number because we have inventory for forward sales. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: We go next now to Richard Farmer at Merrill Lynch. \nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Thanks. Peter and Tim, I would like to ask about the operating leverage and of the margins in the quarter. The operating margin was 18.6%, a lot higher than most of us were modeling. Gross margins as well, 31%, higher than expected. I guess the question is how sustainable do you think that kind of operating leverage is? I heard a few comments about the commodity environment and the leverage of the fixed expense, but is it reasonable to think that margins can go higher from here with more growth? Or are you planning to make decisions to reinvest more aggressively in pricing or other things in a way that would reduce those margins more than a normalized amount? \nPeter Oppenheimer: I will start and Tim may want to add a few comments. We were thrilled with the operating margin in the quarter at 18.6%, but as I said in my prepared remarks, it was exceptionally high, driven by gross margin of 31%, which is well above where we have been operating and our target range, and was certainly positively influenced by the record revenue of over $7.1 billion, so do not get used to 18% operating margins.  With the guidance that I have provided for the March quarter, we have effectively guided to slightly over a 12% operating margin. \nTim Cook: Richard, I would just add to that that as you know, commodity markets cycle and we realize that right now we are on a very favorable cycle, but we would never project that to continue in the long-term. \nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Okay, and then just a follow-up, if I could, on the iPhone. You decided not to support 3G in the first prototype model. Could you talk about your thinking there? How quickly could that change over time? \nPeter Oppenheimer: At this point, we are very much sold on the 2.5 for the edge network with Cingular, because it is much more widespread and widely deployed in the U.S. We do not comment on our roadmaps, et cetera, but obviously we would be where the technology is over time. \nRichard Farmer - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Richard. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: We will go now to David Bailey at Goldman Sachs. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you very much. Just a question on the Mac side. You saw a pretty good sequential up-tick in the ASP, and I was wondering if you were starting to think about maybe pricing a little more aggressively to accelerate Mac growth even more going forward? \nTim Cook: As Peter said, we grew at three times the market. Underneath that, if you look in some specific markets, like the U.S., we grew at 31% versus market growth of 3%, which is substantially above. Portables grew at 65% versus IDC\u2019s forecast at 23%. This is also now eight of the last nine quarters that the Mac has outgrown the market, so I do not see -- I believe we have very, very competitive product offerings that are delivering substantially above market growth. We have no reason to change. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great, and then just a follow-up on the iPod side. Can you give us a general idea -- you used to give some of the information about where the iPod gross margin is. Could you help us understand maybe how that is varying from where it used to be? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, as you know, we have a longstanding practice of not releasing specific product gross margins. However, the corporate gross margin was over 31%, exceeding our gross margin guidance and iPod was key in achieving this. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, David. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: We will go next now to Rebecca Runkle at Morgan Stanley. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks. Two quick questions. First one, Peter and Tim, just goes to the Mac units in the quarter. Obviously you are taking share and you had a great quarter, but if I look sequentially, you saw units drop in the U.S. and in retail. Will you put some color behind that? Was that channel fill? What were the drivers there that caused that sequential drop? \nTim Cook: Rebecca, if you look at the Americas as an entity, and you combine the retail result, the Mac units sequentially were down 16%. That is exactly the sequential decline the previous year, and frankly it is the decline about every year. We have an extremely strong educational business in the Q4 period that includes substantial institutional business, and that institutional business corrects significantly as we get into Q1.  So the sequential decline that we saw is something that is very seasonal in nature. Frankly, we were very happy to overall have the same number of total Macs that we had in Q4, because we expected that given the high level of institutional sales, including two very large one-to-ones that total 50,000 units, we had predicted the Mac to be down from Q4, and it is not. As Peter said in the preamble that, combined with the staggering demand on iPod, allowed us to overachieve our revenue guidance. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: Another way of interpreting that though, if I am understanding correctly, is that your share gains in institutional are pacing about the same rate as your share gains within the U.S. consumer and the holiday buying season patterns that we saw. You\u2019re not seeing that shift on a year-over-year basis, that sequential pattern. You are not seeing that shift, so that would suggest that your share gain -- \nTim Cook: Keep in mind that last year\u2019s sequential pattern included a 14-week Q1, and so to have about the same sequential results is actually a very, very positive point. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: The second question goes to the gross margin question again, just in terms of better understanding the sustainable leverage, taking away the commodity environment and the mix environment, which will clearly cycle. You are seeing tremendous leverage in the business. Is there any reason why that is not sustainable? As we think longer-term and go out say a year from now and look at next December, where if we expect growth in the business, we should be thinking and contemplating what the operating leverage looks like. I know that going quarter to quarter, you are not going to see that same sort of leverage, but as we think longer term, how much of the gross margin leverage that you experienced in the quarter is sustainable? How meaningful was that really in this past December? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Rebecca, while I am guiding to 29.5% for the March quarter, over the longer term, I would continue to target gross margin in the 27% to 28% range, despite our recent results, which have benefited from several factors, including a favorable commodity environment. Looking forward, we are likely to see other factors that will drive gross margin down, such as a different commodity environment or product mix. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: How much of the leverage in the December quarter, or how much of the gross margin differential from your guidance was driven off of leverage? Is that a third of the up-side? \nPeter Oppenheimer: I did not calculate it that way. It helped us, but I would say the bigger drivers were the favorable commodity environment and the product mix. \nRebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks a lot, Peter. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rebecca. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: We will go next now to Keith Bachman at Banc of America. \nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: I have two guys, if I could, for both of you I think on the first one. International sales, is there any way to give us some color on the international sales? In particular, Europe looked pretty good, and the flavor between iPods and CPUs. iPods have in the past few years been traditionally ahead of U.S. orientation. Is that expanding significantly? In other words, was a lot of the upside in your iPod you think driven by sales outside of the U.S.? Is there any color you can give us there on the international sales? \nTim Cook: Keith, if you look at Europe in particular, the Mac unit growth in Europe was 28%, and that compares to a market growth of 9%, so they were also over three times the market.  We did grow iPod sales faster outside the United States, which was our goal, if you recall. As Peter talked about in his opening remarks, we had several countries that did exceptional. We now have five countries that are above 50% -- and this is in addition to the United States -- the U.K., Switzerland, Canada, Australia, and Japan. If you look at some of the other countries that we put significant attention to from an advertising point of view and a channel development point of view, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Austria, Denmark -- all gains between 10 and 20 points of share.  We feel very, very good about how we did on both the Mac and the iPod internationally, particularly in Europe. \nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: My follow-on question, Peter, when answering Rebecca\u2019s questions on your intention of the gross margin, the iPhone is out. It is announced. Will the gross margin on the iPhone be at, better or worse than the corporate average? Is there any color you could give us there? In the past, you have given us a little bit of color as you\u2019ve introduced new products. \nPeter Oppenheimer: As you know, we do not plan to ship the iPhone until June. Consistent with our longstanding practice, we do not provide product level gross margins, but the guidance that I will give you in April for the June quarter certainly will comprehend our anticipated iPhone shipments. \nKeith Bachman - Banc of America Securities: Okay, thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Keith. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: We will go next now to Shannon Cross with Cross Research. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Good afternoon. Just two questions, one with regard to the product mix. Could you give us just a little more clarity, possibly within the iPod side of it, just in terms of where you saw the demand? Obviously shuffles were strong with the ASPs, but anything more you can give us there? Just trying to sort of get a read through to gross margin contribution for each one of them. \nTim Cook: As you know, we do not release specific units within the iPod family, but I would tell you that all three models did exceptionally well. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and then my second question is just with regard to Leopard. We did not get much on Leopard at Macworld. Obviously you had a bit more to announce at that point in time. Anything you can give us on Leopard in terms of color at this point in time? \nTim Cook: We continue to plan to ship Leopard in the spring as we had announced at the developer\u2019s conference. We have a lot of people working on it. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and one final question. Last year, well, actually in \u201905, there was a stock split, about $80. Just curious on your thoughts, I don\u2019t know, Peter, whoever wants to take it at this point in time. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Nothing to share with you today. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thanks. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: We go next now to Bill Shope of J.P. Morgan. \nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Great, thanks. First of all, could you give us an update on the Best Buy pilot and how that fared during the quarter? Secondarily, I am not sure if you have this data, but if you have any surveys or do any work during the quarter to see if there was any evidence that maybe some customers are pausing on Mac purchases ahead of the Leopard launch? \nTim Cook: Relative to Best Buy and more generally, expansion of the Mac channel, we are continuing to selectively expand the Mac channel. We now have around 7500 storefronts around the world. That increased about 1500 across the year. Best Buy in particular, as I mentioned on the last conference call, we had increased about 50 stores during the holiday quarter and we will be working with Best Buy this quarter to evaluate those and conclude what our next steps are. \nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: And then the question on the pause potentially ahead of the Leopard launch? \nTim Cook: I do not see anything related to a pause, relative to Leopard. If you look back at Tiger, we saw no pause related to a new operating system. \nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then my final question, not sure if this was already addressed, but can you give us a read on same-store sales growth for the quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer: For retail? \nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Yes. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Our average store revenue in the quarter was $6.7 million, and I do not have last year\u2019s in front of me. \nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Okay, that is fine. I can dig it out. \nPeter Oppenheimer: I can get that for later. \nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator:  We go now to Harry Blount of Lehman Brothers. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers:  Thanks. Tim, just real quickly, on the number of distribution locations for the iPod, and then for the Mac? \nTim Cook:  For iPod, we're at 40,000. For the Mac, we're at 7,500. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Just to clarify Peter, on a comment you made earlier, I think you said iPod revenue was lower within the Apple stores on a year-over-year basis. Is that also true on a unit basis? \nPeter Oppenheimer:  It was slightly down, yes. Again, as a result of our expanded channel and our supply and demand being in balance this year, where that wasn't the case last year. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: Just to clarify something on the gross margin side of the equation. If I look at retail being up -- about 11% by the looks of it -- and if I take a look at the mix shift here between iPod and Mac, how could we not conclude, in effect, that the gross margins on the iPod line are not as good now -- or better than -- what they are in the PC line? \nPeter Oppenheimer:  Well, again, we don't comment specifically on product gross margins, but as I commented before, iPod certainly played a role in the gross margin achievement that we had in the quarter at 30%, which was above our guidance. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers: The last questions relate to the channel, your indication of 200,000 units increase in channel inventory. I just want to make sure, from an understanding perspective, that includes all of the iPod units that are resident at all of your 40,000 distribution points? \nTim Cook:  Yes. \nHarry Blount - Lehman Brothers:  Okay, great. Thanks. \nOperator: We'll go to Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns. \n Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns:  Sure. Just two things, if I could.  One, I just wanted to clarify in terms of where you are in terms of -- this is an iPhone question --is the design fixed? In the sense that one of the questions people have asked about is the battery being sealed. Is what you see what you get, and is there any consideration towards changing that? \nTim Cook:  Andy, we'll provide more details on the iPhone right before we begin shipping in June. \n Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Thank you. \nOperator:  We'll go now to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon. First in terms of the iPhone, Steve Jobs talked about 10 million units. Is that for fiscal '08 or calendar '08? Where did that number come from? Maybe just a little bit of logic behind that number. \nTim Cook: Gene, calendar year '08 is what Steve referenced in his keynote. The point that he made was that the worldwide market for total cell phones is somewhere around 1 billion and our objective of getting 1% of it would yield 10 million units across the calendar year. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: I know you talked about a June launch, do you think that that will generally be in full production by June, or do you think this is going to be a situation where it will be relatively -- because that 10 million units for '08 just seems pretty low. If you have availability, it would seem that initially that number should be more than easily achievable. So in other words, do you expect to have capacity constraints at the beginning of the shipment of the iPhone? \nTim Cook:  Gene, we're still a few months away from June and I'm sure we'll share more details as we get closer to the launch. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: In terms of Apple TV, maybe you could talk a little bit about projected units or the addressable market, or put some sort of parameters. I know it's the best-selling product on your website right now, so maybe you could put some parameters of how should we think about that Apple TV opportunity? \nTim Cook:  We just announced last week, as you know. We've just started taking orders, and we plan to ship, as Steve indicated, in February. For this particular quarter, we'll have just a few shipping weeks, and we've incorporated our thinking about both the supply and demand side into the guidance that Peter gave earlier. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray:  Do you think Apple TV is more of a niche market similar to AirPort Express has been for the music market, or do you see this as a broader platform? \nTim Cook:  If you're asking from a demand point of view, I think we'll see as we move forward. It's really too early to tell. From how we're positioning the product, as Steve indicated in the keynote, we see this as the DVD player of the 21st century so it's clearly not a niche. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Lastly in terms of the halo effect, some investors are disappointed at the Mac number. Obviously you're coming up against a tough comp in the September quarter with the educational quarter, and historically you're flat to down in December. Maybe this is just an example of The Street getting ahead of themselves. How do you conceptually think about the halo effect, and what inning we're in with that? \nTim Cook:  Well, I think several things that I feel really indicate that there is a halo effect:  Also, my view is that we have significant momentum on the Mac. This is the eighth quarter of the last nine that the Mac outgrew the market and I don't think a lot of people can say that. So we are thrilled with this number. It is higher than what we projected. I can't speak to the models that you guys have, but we are thrilled internally on the number. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Do you have any idea of the 21 million iPods, just a rough guess of what percentage of those went into new iPod owners' hands? \nTim Cook:  I don't know. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Robert Semple with Credit Suisse. \n Robert Semple - Credit Suisse: Thanks. Tim, can you maybe talk a little bit about how you're conceptually thinking about iPhone cannibalization of iPod, specifically at the video iPod level? \nTim Cook:  As Peter indicated, we just announced the iPhone, so it's too soon to tell. It's hard to predict but we believe that we've got a great line of iPods shipping today that are a very wide range of prices and capacities and form factors to meet a lot of different needs from different consumers, and so we'll see. Perhaps we'll have more on this as we talk again next quarter. \n Robert Semple - Credit Suisse:  On a longer-term basis, do you see these two markets legitimately converging or is there going to be a place for both a specific iPod-type device and a mobile phone on a longer-term basis? \nTim Cook: We'll see. Again, the iPod has a significant line of different products with different price points and different capabilities and so we'll talk more as time goes on about those. We don't ship the iPhone until June. \n Robert Semple - Credit Suisse: Just one final follow-up. At the Macworld keynote last week, Steve talked about 50% of all Macs in the quarter -- I think this was all Macs, not just retail Macs -- were sold to new users. I think that's the first time we've heard that metric. Can you just tell us where that number had been tracking previously? \nTim Cook:  For some time, the retail stores have been hitting a number somewhere around 50%. The thing that is new is that this is now expanded to the rest of the channel in the United States. We feel this is yet another indicator that between the halo effect and the fact that we've got the best line of Macintoshs we've ever shipped before, and a great OS, it's the total of all of that that has produced this result. We're thrilled about it. \n Robert Semple - Credit Suisse: Thanks. \nOperator: We go next now to Jesse Tortora with Prudential. \n Jesse Tortora - Prudential: Hi, guys. Would you say the iPod gross margin contribution this quarter was due more to better fixed cost absorption on the higher units, or a better cost structure due to product refreshes in the back half of '06? Basically just trying to figure out where the upside came from in terms of the gross margin. \nPeter Oppenheimer: As I commented on an earlier question, I think the larger factors are the ones I cited, the favorable commodity pricing environment and product mix. \n Jesse Tortora - Prudential:  Do you think the cost structure on the iPods, are you pleased with the cost structure with the new refresh in the back half of the year, or do you think that's not changed meaningfully? \nPeter Oppenheimer:  I was pleased with all elements of the iPod performance this quarter. \n Jesse Tortora - Prudential:  Great. Peter, one more question. How about as far as the cash use on your balance sheet? Maybe you can give us your thoughts in terms of the buybacks and the acquisitions? \nPeter Oppenheimer:  Not really changed from past quarters. The stock buyback programs and other forms of returning cash to the shareholders are reviewed with the senior management and the board from time to time, but our preference continues to be to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to preserve our ability to make strategic investments or acquisitions. \n Jesse Tortora - Prudential: Thanks. \nOperator: We go next now to Bill Fearnley at FTN Midwest. \n Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Yes, good afternoon, a couple of questions here on the Mac product line. How is the Mac Pro performing versus your expectations now and your latest thoughts on the transitions to some of the products that the design professionals are looking for? Also, did Mac Pro help ASPs in the quarter at all? Then I have a couple of follow-ups. \nTim Cook:  Let me address the total Pro market, which I think is what you're getting at. The Pro market met our expectations internally. However, those expectations were tempered by the fact that some customers are still awaiting the Creative Suite from Adobe to be released. They did release a beta, and I think there's a lot of positive comments about the beta product and they have announced that the release will be coming in the second calendar quarter of this year, so just next quarter. We would hope to see some of those customers that are delaying purchases begin to buy again at that point. \n Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Also on Boot Camp downloads , can you update on that? Are you still on track to add the Boot Camp functionality to Leopard when it's released in the spring? \nTim Cook:  We are now up to 1.5 million downloads so it continues to be of great interest to a number of different people, and our intention is still the same, to include it in Leopard as we release Leopard in the spring. \n Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest:  Thanks. One last quick follow-up on iPods, if I could. Could you comment on the linearity of iPod shipments in the first quarter in terms of how the product flowed? Did you have a big burst of product in the month of December, and any additional comments on linearity? Thanks. \nTim Cook:  From a sell-through point of view, December is obviously a very key month. I would tell you that we had weeks that the sell-through was just stunning on the iPod. We obviously shipped the product prior to the sell-through and so the linearity of shipments is pulled to the left in order to accomplish the sell-through. \n Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest:  Thanks. \nOperator:  We go now to Kevin Hunt at Thomas Weisel Partners. \n Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel: Hi, I had a couple questions. First of all, can you comment on the Cisco lawsuit over the iPhone name, and will that have any potential impact on your ability to ship starting in June? I have a couple other follow-ups. \nTim Cook:  We think the Cisco trademark lawsuit is silly, as we've said before. There are already several companies that use the name iPhone for voice over IP products, and we believe that Cisco's U.S. trademark registration is tenuous at best. We are the first company to ever use the iPhone name for a cell phone, and if Cisco wants to challenge us, we're confident we'll prevail. \n Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel:  Okay. And then earlier, Tim, I think you gave the channel numbers for iPod and Mac for this year . Do you know what those were for a year ago? You gave the number of channel locations. \nTim Cook: The 40,000 has been relatively consistent for several quarters, although we've taken some channels out and added others. So we've added to the channel over that period of time. The Mac number is up 1,500 across last year. \n Kevin Hunt - Thomas Weisel: Just one other follow-up. I'm a little confused here. I heard you say that Mac units have been typically down sequentially in December over September, but I'm looking at the last four years of data and they've been up every year, including up 25% in holiday '04. I'm a little confused by that comment, so can you just clarify that again for me? \nTim Cook:  In 2004, we had a very strange occurrence that we had no G5 processors to ship, if you recall, and so we went an entire quarter without shipping the iMac. In fact, we pushed the introduction out until the end of that quarter and then shipped very minimal units. That also affected our Pro machine sell-through that quarter. So 2004 would not be a good comparison.  If you look at 2005 and you look at the Americas line and add retail to it, you would see that sequentially there was a 16% fall, which is the same as this year. That 16% fall was comparing, however, to a 14-week Q1. That suggests that we did better this year. \nOperator:  We'll go now to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. \n Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Thanks, good afternoon. Hoping to get a feel for how you're thinking about the balance between the very favorable commodity pricing environment, record gross margins and top line growth. In other words, are you thinking about getting a little bit more aggressive on iPod pricing in the first half of the year to pass those commodity savings on to customers? \nPeter Oppenheimer:  We don't disclose our pricing plans, obviously, but I would just point out that we sold 21 million iPods. There's not a price issue on iPods. Customers believe they're of great value, and I would make the same point on the Macintosh that grew at three times the market. \n Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: To follow up on that, if the number one driver of gross margins was mix and margin performance of the iPod business, why are you expecting margins to fall so much quarter on quarter in your fiscal second quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer:  I guided gross margin down largely as a result of less leverage on fixed costs from the lower revenue, a different product mix, including a full quarter of the iPod Shuffle. I expect higher music sales from the gift card redemptions, and lower software sales as we approach the Leopard release. Those are the primary factors. \n Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank:  Thank you. \nOperator:  We go now to Jonathan Hoopes at Think Equity Partners. \n Jonathan Hoopes - Think Equity Partners: Thanks for taking my question. Could you quickly go over what happened in Japan? I've got a couple more questions after that. \nTim Cook: Japan, two things. One, the PC market in Japan is among the weakest in the world. IDC was projecting a 16% contraction year-over-year in the home market, which is obviously the market that is most important to us. In the MP3 space, we maintained a 50% share of the market. However, the market did not grow, and with the lower prices that we announced in September, that resulted, along with the CPU performance, to a lower revenue on a year-over-year basis.  We are disappointed with the results, even though they're consistent with the market in both areas of PC and MP3 and we're putting additional emphasis there. We just started running a localized Mac/PC ad that's getting very, very good reviews there. \n Jonathan Hoopes - Think Equity Partners:  Thanks, Tim. With regard to retail CapEx, did you mention that, Peter? I missed it if you did. \nPeter Oppenheimer:  In the quarter? \n Jonathan Hoopes - Think Equity Partners:  Yes. \nPeter Oppenheimer:  I'll give you our total CapEx, $142 million in the quarter, of which retail was $36 million. \n Jonathan Hoopes - Think Equity Partners: Thanks. On the Apple TV, I know you're not going to give us an outlook on your expected unit shipments, but will you be breaking that out as a separate line item, or will that be part of other music and products as you see it now? \nPeter Oppenheimer:  It will be a part of the other music-related products and services line. \n Jonathan Hoopes - Think Equity Partners:  Thank you. Finally, Peter, you mentioned before that the iLife is a January refresh. We didn't hear anything about that during Macworld. Is iLife still a January refresh time schedule? \nPeter Oppenheimer:  We don't announce our future products, but stay tuned. \n Jonathan Hoopes - Think Equity Partners:  Thank you. \nOperator: We'll go to Brian Blair - Wedge Partners. \n Brian Blair - Wedge Partners: Thanks. Of the 40,000 distribution points you mentioned, can you talk about how that breaks out internationally versus U.S.? \nTim Cook: The bulk of the 40,000 are outside the United States. \n Brian Blair - Wedge Partners:  So more than 50%? \nTim Cook:  More than 50%, yes. \n Brian Blair - Wedge Partners: I know it's early obviously, but can you talk about if there are going to be additional software application download opportunities for Apple on the iPhone? \nPeter Oppenheimer:  Again, we'll talk more about the iPhone as we get closer to shipment. \n Brian Blair - Wedge Partners: Thank you very much. \nOperator: We go next now to Shaw Wu with American Technology. \n Shaw Wu - American Technology: Just one question for Peter. Your OpEx guidance is a bit more than I would expect, given the sequential decline in revenue that you're also guiding. I was just wondering if marketing programs are in place there? I mean expenses associated with marketing your new products, such as iPhone and Apple TV associated with that, or are you just being conservative in terms of the guidance there? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, Shaw, as I've said over the last couple of years, we're very confident in our business, in our strategy, and we are investing for both long-term growth in revenue and earnings, and that's certainly true in the March quarter and it was true in the December quarter. \nOperator: We go next now to Charlie Wolf with Needham. \n Charlie Wolf - Needham: Most of my questions have been answered, but I do want to touch on Boot Camp. As I understand it, Apple will not be introducing virtualization software in the Leopard release. Having said that, will Apple support third party software like Parallels and VM-ware? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Charlie, we support Parallels today, they are a key application partner, developer for us. We are clearly supporting them. \n Charlie Wolf - Needham:  Thank you. \nOperator:  We go now to Steve Lidberg with Pacific Crest Securities. \n Steve Lidberg - Pacific Crest Securities: Can you provide an update on the retail store plan, what you're targeting in terms of the number of store rollouts in '07, and provide a headcount of where you ended the quarter on the employee side with the retail stores? Thanks. \nPeter Oppenheimer:  Sure. We ended the December quarter with about 6,600 employees in our retail stores out of about 21,500 for Apple overall. We opened five stores in the December quarter, would expect to open seven in the March quarter, and would expect to open about 35 to 40 in fiscal '07. \n Steve Lidberg - Pacific Crest Securities:  Thank you. \nOperator:  We'll go next now to Shebly Seyrafi with Caris and Company. \n Shebly Seyrafi - Caris:  Thanks very much. You talked about the iPod gross margin increasing better than expected due to mix and component prices, but can you describe what you mean by mix? Because in my analysis, the Shuffle likely did well. Your blended iPod ASP was down 8%. Do you mean the video iPod did perhaps better than you were expecting three months ago? What do you mean by mix, exactly? \nPeter Oppenheimer: To clarify, the gross margin was about 300 basis points better than our guidance, and that really resulted from a better commodity environment across all of our commodities, so not only in iPods but Macs as well. A better product mix -- and I'll come back to that -- and higher revenue from leveraging the fixed costs with the revenue over-performance that we had.  As it relates to product mix, we saw customers buying up the line. For example, in the Mac business, we had a very strong Mac Book Pro quarter. That certainly helped us from a margin perspective. \n Shebly Seyrafi - Caris:  But within the iPod itself, were there positive mix effects? I would think the video iPod gross margin is higher than the shuffle gross margin, for example? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, again, we don't provide individual product gross margins, but our gross margin exceeded our guidance and the iPod line certainly played a role for us in achieving that result. \n Shebly Seyrafi - Caris:  Thank you very much. \nNancy Paxton:  Thanks, Shebly.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us.  Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, and earnings per share. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2007, the Form 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2008, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.  And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the our September quarter results, which were record-breaking on a number of fronts. First, we sold more Macs than we have in any other quarter in Apple's history. Second, we sold more iPhones in the September quarter than in all previous quarters combined. Third, we sold more iPods than in any prior non-holiday quarter and finally, we generated more revenue and earnings than in any previous September quarter in Apple's history.  Revenue for the quarter was $7.9 billion, representing 27% growth and an increase of $1.68 billion over the previous September quarter\u2019s revenue of $6.22 billion.  Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 18.3%, due to higher-than-anticipated gross margin.  Net income was $1.14 billion, which was up 26% over the prior September quarter\u2019s results and translated to earnings per share of $1.26.  As we have discussed in the past, because we may provide new features and software applications to iPhone and Apple TV customers in the future free of charge, in accordance with GAAP we use subscription accounting to recognize revenue and cost of sales for these products on a straight line basis over their two-year estimated economic lives. This results in the deferral of almost all revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple TV during the quarter in which these products are sold to customers.  In contrast, we generally recognize revenue and cost of sales for our other hardware products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sales as we do not provide new features or software applications for those products free of charge.  As we reported in our press release, iPhone unit sales grew significantly in the September quarter, resulting in a material increase in the amount of iPhone revenue and product costs that had been deferred for recognition in future periods. Specifically, deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV sales grew to $5.8 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of nearly $3.8 billion from the end of the June quarter. If iPhone revenue was not deferred, iPhone would have represented 39% of Apple's revenue in the September quarter.  While our GAAP results provide significant insight into our performance, we are supplementing our analysis of the business internally by using non-GAAP financial measures that correspond to the total sales and product costs of iPhones and Apple TVs sold during the quarter. We believe these non-GAAP measures provide us with meaningful additional insight into the performance of our business, as well as provide information about iPhone and Apple TV that is similar to the information we use to analyze the performance of Macs and iPods.  Beginning with this quarter\u2019s earnings release, we plan to provide you quarterly with non-GAAP financial measures we use internally to help us evaluate our performance and make operating decisions. I encourage you to read the earnings press release as it provides a full description of these non-GAAP measures, including how we use them, how they are derived, and their limitations.  I would now like to go through several of the non-GAAP measures. First, we use a non-GAAP measure that we call adjusted sales to provide more information regarding our underlying sales trends and to evaluate the sales dollars of products sold in the period. We calculated adjusted sales by backing out the September quarter\u2019s amortization of deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV sales and adding back all amounts generally due at the time of sale for iPhones and Apple TVs shipped in the September quarter.  Adjusted sales totaled $11.7 billion, which was about $3.8 billion higher than our reported revenue of $7.9 billion.  Second, we use a non-GAAP measure we call adjusted cost of sales that corresponds to adjusted sales. We calculated adjusted cost of sales by backing out the September quarter\u2019s amortization of deferred costs related to iPhone and Apple TV and adding back the total cost of the iPhones and Apple TVs shipped in the September quarter. We also used an estimate of the total future warranty expense related to the iPhones and Apple TVs sold in the September quarter rather than reflecting the actual iPhone and Apple TV warranty expenses incurred during the September quarter. We then calculated the non-GAAP measure of adjusted gross margin by subtracting adjusted cost of sales from adjusted sales. For the September quarter, adjusted gross margin was $4.6 billion, which was $1.8 billion higher than recorded gross margin.  Third, we used the non-GAAP measure of adjusted net income to evaluate our performance based on the current period iPhone and Apple TV sales and to facilitate ongoing operating decisions. For the September quarter, adjusted net income was $2.4 billion, which was $1.3 billion higher than reported net income.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis and understanding of our performance during the September quarter.  Now turning to details of our results, I would like to begin with the iPhone, which had a breakout quarter, thanks to the July 11th launch of the iPhone 3G. We sold nearly 6.9 million iPhones during the September quarter, exceeding the 6.1 million units shipped over the entire lifetime of the first generation iPhone. And with more than two months to go in the calendar year, we have already surpassed our goal of 10 million iPhone sales in calendar 2008.  Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, iPhone accessories, and carrier payments totaled $806 million during the quarter. We dramatically expanded iPhone distribution in the last quarter. We increased the number of countries where we are selling iPhone from six to 51, and we expect to be in more than 70 countries by the end of the December quarter.  With the addition of Best Buy, we have over 3,100 points of iPhone distribution in the U.S. and with our international expansion, we currently have over 30,000 points of distribution around the world.  I would like to now talk about our Mac products and services. We are pleased to have shipped over 2.6 million Macs, which was a new company record for any quarter. This represents 21% year-over-year growth and is higher than the overall PC market rate of growth for the September quarter based on the latest estimate published by IDC.  Although Mac sales grew faster than the market, we believe Mac growth was impacted by purchase delays based on speculation about the new launch of our portables and budgetary constraints affecting education institution purchases. We are unsure how the economy may have affected Mac sales in the quarter.  And of course, we are very enthusiastic about the new notebooks introduced last week. The new MacBook and MacBook Pro redefined notebook design while dramatically lowering the entry price for advanced notebook features, including all metal enclosures, pro performance notebook graphics, brilliant instant on LED backlit displays, and new large glass multi-touch track-pads.  We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.  Now I\u2019d like to discuss our music products and services. We sold 11 million iPods, a new record for a non-holiday quarter and an increase of 8% over the year-ago quarter. Last month we introduced our new line-up of iPods, including the fourth generation iPod Nano featuring a sleek new curved aluminum and glass design in nine great colors. We also introduced the second generation iPhone Touch, building on its groundbreaking original features while redefining the entry price of $229.  Both iPods incorporate the new iTunes 8 Genius technology, which automatically creates playlists from songs in users\u2019 libraries that go great together with just one click. We remain very pleased with iPod market share. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the month of September based on the latest data published by NPD, and we continued to gain share year over year in most international markets, including the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, Canada, and Australia, based on the latest data published by GFK and BCN.  We began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.  The iTunes store had a very good quarter thanks to the strong music and video sales and the tremendous success of the App Store. We now have over 65 million iTunes customer accounts and a music catalog of over 8.5 million titles, and we are very pleased with our fall 2008 TV lineup, which now includes primetime programming from all four major networks in stunning high definition.  I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which delivered strong results with revenue growing 37% year over year to $1.72 billion. The store sold 596,000 Macs during the quarter, an all-time quarterly record and an increase of 26% year over year. Over half the Macs sold through the retail stores during the quarter were to customers who have never owned a Mac before.  We opened 31 new stores during the quarter, including 13 stores outside the U.S. to end the quarter with 247 stores. With an average of 226 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $7.6 million, compared to $6.6 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 15%. Retail segment margin was $301 million, compared to $268 million in the year-ago quarter.  Our stores hosted a new all-time high of 42.7 million visitors during the September quarter, or 14,500 visitors per store per week. We have continued to invest in our stores to accommodate this record-breaking traffic and to offer customers a great experience. We recently launched the fastest way to buy an iPhone, which customers are loving. After starting the process by answering a few questions online, customers can complete their iPhone purchase and activations in our stores in just about a minute longer than it takes to purchase an iPod.  Total company gross margin was 34.7%, which was better than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, due primarily to a better component pricing environment. To a lesser degree, we also benefited from higher software sales and payments from carriers related to first generation iPhone and lower costs associated with the iPod product transition.  Operating expenses were $1.3 billion, including $120 million in stock-based compensation expense. The OpEx total was about $30 million higher than our guidance, largely as a result of additional advertising and the operating costs of selling 6.9 million iPhones.  OI&E was $140 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 28.2%, below our guidance of 30.5% due largely to a higher-than-anticipated mix of foreign earnings.  We are very pleased to have generated $3.7 billion in cash during the quarter, ending with $24.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $4.3 billion. Our investment priority has been preservation of capital, which has served us well in these difficult credit markets. At the end of the September quarter, our unrealized mark-to-market loss was $117 million on the total portfolio of $24.5 billion, which was only an $80 million sequential increase from the end of the June quarter. We plan to hold these investments and do not expect to realize any material losses on them.  Looking ahead to the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.  We will continue our practice of providing guidance based on GAAP and will report our December non-GAAP measures to you in January when we release our results. We enter this holiday quarter with the best products we\u2019ve ever shipped, including the iPhone 3G and new notebooks and iPods, and we remain very confident in our business.  Our visibility is low and our forecasting is challenging and as a result, we are going to be prudent in predicting the December quarter. We are providing a wide range for our guidance for the quarter and we are targeting revenue between $9 billion and $10 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 30% and 31%, reflecting approximately $25 related to stock-based compensation expense, down from 34.7% gross margin in the September quarter. The sequential decline of our gross margin reflects the recent introductions of the new iPods and notebooks.  We expect OpEx to be between $1.45 billion and $1.47 billion, including about $150 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $140 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 30.5%.  We are targeting EPS between $1.06 and $1.35.  In closing, we are extremely pleased with the performance of our business during fiscal 2008. We generated nearly $32.5 billion in revenue, a 35% increase from 2007, and we gained market share globally in Macs, iPods, and iPhones. We are also pleased to have generated $9.1 billion in cash during the fiscal year.  We are headed into the holiday season with our best product lineup ever and we are very enthusiastic about our expanding geographic reach with iPhone 3G. We remain very focused on developing the industry\u2019s most innovative products, managing our business, and gaining share in each of our markets.  Before we open the call to questions, we have a special guest here today who would like to say a few words and answer some of your questions -- our CEO, Steve Jobs. \nSteven P. Jobs: Hi, everyone. Some remarkable things are happening at Apple but everything is now set against the backdrop of this global economic slowdown, so it seemed like a good time for me to make a few remarks and help answer some of your questions.  I would like to go back and talk about the non-GAAP financial results because I think this is a pretty big deal. In addition to reporting an outstanding quarter, today we are also introducing non-GAAP financial results which eliminate the impact of subscription accounting. As you know, subscription accounting is the solution we adopted to let us provide free software updates to iPhone users under GAAP accounting rules. In accordance with the subscription accounting treatment required by GAAP, Apple recognizes the revenue and the cost of goods sold for the iPhone over its economic life of two years rather than upon sale as we do for Macs and iPods.  Because by its nature subscription accounting spreads the impact of iPhone\u2019s contribution to Apple's overall sales, gross margin, and net income over two years, it can make it more difficult for the average Apple manager or the average investor to evaluate the company\u2019s overall performance. As long as our iPhone business was small relative to our Mac and music businesses, this didn\u2019t really matter much. But this past quarter, as you heard, our iPhone business has grown to about $4.6 billion, or 39% of Apple's total business, clearly too big for Apple management or investors to ignore. Hence our introduction today of non-GAAP financial results alongside our reported GAAP results.  As you can see, the non-GAAP financial results are truly stunning. By eliminating subscription accounting, adjusted sales for the quarter were $11.68 billion, 48% higher than the reported revenue of $7.9 billion, while adjusted income was $2.44 billion, 115% higher than the reported net income of $1.14 billion. Adjusted net income that is more than double our reported income -- if this isn't stunning, I don\u2019t know what is, all due to the incredible success of the iPhone 3G.  I would like to now highlight two remarkable milestones resulting from iPhone\u2019s outstanding performance last quarter. The first is that Apple beat RIM. In their most recent quarter, Research in Motion, or RIM, reported selling 6.1 million BlackBerry devices. Compared to our most recent quarter sales of 6.9 million iPhones, Apple outsold RIM last quarter and this is a milestone for us. RIM is a good company that makes good products and so it is surprising that after only 15 months in the market, we could outsell them in any quarter.  But even more remarkable is this -- measured by revenues, Apple has become the world\u2019s third-largest mobile phone supplier. I know this sounds crazy, but it\u2019s true -- as measured in revenues, not units, Apple has become the third largest mobile phone supplier. Let\u2019s look at the ranking -- Nokia is clearly number one at 12.7 billion; Samsung number two at 5.9 billion; Apple is number three at 4.6 billion; Sony Ericsson, number four at 4.2; LG, number five at 3.4 billion; Motorola, number six at 3.2; and RIM number seven at 2.1. Pretty amazing.  Now, both of these things, beating RIM in units and becoming the third largest mobile supplier in revenues are amazing feats but part of this was the result of expanding into over 50 countries and there\u2019s no guarantee that sustained sales will equal initial sales. And who knows what the future results will be, given the worldwide economic slowdown but we actually outsold RIM last quarter and ranked as the third largest mobile phone supplier in revenues. Not bad for being in the market for only 15 months.  I would now like to talk about the App Store for a few minutes. One area that where we have completely changed the value proposition for mobile devices is the App Store. Customers will download the 200 millionth application from the App Store tomorrow, only 102 days since its launch on July 11th -- the 200 millionth app. We\u2019ve never seen anything like this in our careers. There are now over 5,500 applications offered on the App Store in 62 countries around the world and the rate of new applications being submitted is increasing every week. Competitors are scrambling to copy our App Store but it\u2019s not as easy as it looks and we are far along in creating the virtuous cycle of cool applications begetting more iPhone sales, thereby creating an even larger market which will attract even more iPhone software development. It is clear that customers are now attracted to iPhone not only for its amazing functionality and revolutionary multi-touch user interface but also for its unique ability to let users easily purchase, download, and use thousands of different applications, ranging from free games to financial planning and health management -- all of this in only 102 days.  And now I\u2019d like to touch on the notebooks that we just introduced. Last week we introduced our new MacBook and MacBook Pro line. These products are very important since notebooks comprise two-thirds or more of the Macs we sell. These new MacBooks are some of the best products we\u2019ve ever created and it\u2019s already clear that our customers love them. We\u2019ve had a very, very strong launch and we are anxiously awaiting to see the demand trajectory that will unfold during the quarter. The level of quality these products deliver to customers is mind-blowing for their price points. The unibody precision aluminum enclosures would normally cost hundreds of dollars by themselves. The electronics, especially the graphics, are state-of-the-art in mobile computing and features like the glass track pad are unique in the industry. With the introduction of LED backlit displays on these mainstream notebooks, over 90% of the notebooks Apple sells now use LED backlit displays.  Another thing worth noting is that these new notebooks are the greenest products Apple has ever offered. You will hear more and more about that from us in the future.  So now let\u2019s turn to the economy, to the broader market conditions resulting from the global economic slowdown and credit crisis. First, let me say that we are not economists. Your next-door neighbor can likely predict what is going to happen as accurately as we can, but we do know a few things.  First, we have the best customers in the world. I wouldn\u2019t trade our customers for any other company\u2019s customers in the entire world. They are some of the smartest, most product aware customers in the market and they have chosen Apple's quality, hardware and software products. While they may postpone purchases in tough times, they are unlikely to abandon the quality and seamless integration which they have personally experienced and become accustomed to with Apple's products. So if the economic downturn does affect them, they are more likely to delay than switch.  Two, we still have a minority market share of the PC market and a miniscule market share of the mobile phone market. While we may not appeal to every prospective customer, the percentage of prospective customers we need to attract in order to significantly increase our market share isn't that many and we have 250 Apple retail stores that already sell half their Macs to new-to-Mac customers.  Three, we have the best product lineup in Apple's history. The new MacBooks in particular should trigger a serious upgrade cycle in our installed base. We\u2019ll see. I feel very good about our product lineup as we head into the holidays and beyond.  Four, we have the most talented and creative employees in the world -- just look at their results -- the new MacBooks, the iMac, the iPhone, the iPod Nano and Touch, Leopard, iLife, and on and on. None of our competitors can deliver products in this class.  And five, we have almost $25 billion safely in the bank and zero debt. This provides us tremendous stability and the ability to invest our way through this downturn. This is what we did during the last downturn -- we increased R&D investments and created some of our best new products and businesses, like the Apple retail stores, for one. This downturn may also present some extraordinary opportunities for companies that have the cash to take advantage of them, like Apple does.  In summary, we have the strongest product lineup in Apple's history, the most talented employees, and the best customers and $25 billion in the bank. We may get buffeted around by the waves a little bit but we will be fine and stronger than ever when the water is calm in the future.  With that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions for Peter, Tim, or myself.  \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from Bill Shope with Credit Suisse. \nBill Shope - Credit Suisse: Thank you. Steve, clearly your results and the guidance paint two very different pictures of the world and I was wondering, have you seen any new trends in recent business that would suggest such a disparity or is this really simply just prudence, given all the macro headlines we are all seeing right now?\nSteven P. Jobs: Well, there\u2019s a lot of prudence in there but it\u2019s also October and October has always been a little bit of a foggy month for us. You know, we are always biting our nails, wondering whether we ordered too many iPods or this or that for the holiday quarter because sales often don\u2019t really take off until November some time. So the months of October and April are our slowest during the year and we think we are doing the right things. We think we know what the results may be but October and April are foggy months for us in terms of predicting the whole quarter but there\u2019s a lot of prudence built in.  We\u2019re not economists and we read the same newspapers you do. \nBill Shope - Credit Suisse: Great. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Your next question will come from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thank you. Steve, thanks for being on the call. I would like to start off with a question regarding share repurchase and just ask your and the board\u2019s latest thoughts on share repurchase now. I understand that cash is a good thing to have in the current environment but you are using relatively little of that cash for things like retail store openings and for investments in the business. What are your thoughts on returning some to shareholders?\nSteven P. Jobs: You know, I think this economic downturn may present some extraordinary opportunities to companies that have cash. I think cash is already king and it may get more so that way, so we are very comfortable with our cash position in the bank and it\u2019s not burning a hole in our pocket. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Okay, thank you. And if I could follow-up, Peter, and maybe ask if you could give us a sense of how much of the gross margin outlook for the fourth quarter is related to the higher costs associated with the aluminum uni-body enclosures, and maybe some sense of how much more expensive that is then the way you were doing things previously?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, the guidance that I provided, Rich, the sequential decline really is driven from the introductions of the notebooks and iPods, which we couldn\u2019t be more excited about. And there\u2019s many, many new technologies, new features in those besides the uni-body but that contributed.  As I said on the last call, we were going to introduce these products. They were initially going to have higher costs and through volume manufacturing and cost engineering, we\u2019re going to work down, work to get down the cost curve over time. But we\u2019ve made a big investment in these products and these are some of the best we\u2019ve ever shipped. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Okay. Peter, could I ask one more -- and that is we have seen a 35% decline in aluminum pricing so far -- well, since you gave the guidance for fiscal \u201909 gross margin, aluminum is down 35%. How quickly can we expect that to start flowing through the P&L? Thank you. \nPeter Oppenheimer: We would certainly sell our new MacBooks cheaper if we just delivered them with a block of aluminum but we have to machine that aluminum and it\u2019s a fairly precision operation, so the cost of the aluminum matters some but is not a dominant cost. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Okay. All right, thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Your next question will come from Ben Reitzes, Barclays Capital.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Thanks a lot. Steve, can you talk about the pricing of your Mac line right now and how you feel that is positioned going into this economy? And in particular as well, maybe your thoughts -- there\u2019s this new NetBook category that\u2019s getting a lot of hype and just where do you see that playing out in the marketplace and your position in the market there?\nSteven P. Jobs: Well, again this particular downturn is not creating a market of cheaper computers. That market has existed for some time and there are parts of that market that we choose not to play in.  I think when people want a product of the class that we make, over and over again people have done the price comparisons and we\u2019re actually quite competitive. So we choose to be in certain segments of the market and we choose not to be in certain segments of the market. And the question is is the downturn going to drive some of our customers to those lower segments of the marketplace and get to buy lesser products? And I will be surprised if that happens in large numbers and I actually think that there are still a tremendous number of customers that we don\u2019t have in the Windows world or in the other 99% of the phone market we don\u2019t have who would like to and can afford to buy Apple products. So we\u2019ll see what the ratio of those two things are but we\u2019re not tremendously worried.  As we look at the NetBook category, that\u2019s a nascent category. There\u2019s as best as we can tell not a lot of them getting sold. You know, one of our entrants into that category, if you will, is the iPhone for browsing the Internet and doing e-mail and all the other things that a NetBook lets you do, and being connected via the cellular net wherever you are, an iPhone is a pretty good solution for that, and it fits in your pocket. But we\u2019ll wait and see how that nascent category evolves and we\u2019ve got some pretty interesting ideas if it does evolve. \nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Okay, great, thanks and just a quick follow-up on the iPhone -- I mean, given it\u2019s so new for you, Steve, do you have any view on how it will do in this economy, and in particular you still have some international expansion going on, so just given the iPhone is new, we\u2019ve been through downturns maybe with Macs before, although a long time ago, and maybe even consumer devices, this iPhone is so new, how do you see it doing in this economy?\nSteven P. Jobs: We\u2019ll be glad to tell you how it does. \nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Okay. Thanks a lot. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Your next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: A question with regard to channel inventory and what you are seeing in terms of -- I mean, iPod, iPhone, Macs, just comments from the retailers -- again, I know it\u2019s October and as you said, it\u2019s a bit foggy but any sort of thoughts on how things are positioned that you can give us, in more detail than maybe what you provided earlier?\nTimothy D. Cook: In the Mac area, as Peter said in his opening comments, we began and ended the quarter between three and four weeks of inventory and that\u2019s below our target, as you know, of four to five weeks. In the iPod, we began and ended between four and six weeks, which is right in our target range and on the iPhone, we were shipping to carriers in 51 countries by the end of the quarter and we had over 30,000 points of distribution. With the 44 countries that we had launched prior to the end of August, the weeks of inventory that we had at the end of the quarter for those countries was less than six weeks. For the remaining seven countries where launches occurred in late September or early October, we don\u2019t have enough data yet to quantify the weeks of inventory. However, to be precise, at the end of the quarter I can tell you that we had about 2 million iPhones in total channel inventory across all of the 51 countries and we feel that this inventory is about right. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and I\u2019m curious -- any idea on how much the Mac refresh would have impacted sales last quarter as you sort of cleared the channel?\nTimothy D. Cook: I think if you look at the Mac, there are two things that I believe impacted the Mac sales last quarter and possibly a third. The first is that U.S. K to 12 institutional sales were down 7% year-on-year to about 200,000 units, and this is due to state and local budget constraints. California in particular was down 28% year-on-year. That 7% contraction was a significant change from what we had seen in the first three quarters of the fiscal year which were up 29%. In particular, purchases of 1,000 units or more were down significantly, both sequentially and year over year.  If the unit sales had grown last quarter in K to 12 at 29%, which is what we had been seeing going into the quarter instead of contracting by 7%, then Mac unit sales would have been 75,000 units higher and so this was a big issue for the quarter from a Mac perspective.  The second thing that we believe was that customers were delaying purchases because of the portable transition. As you know, there were rampant rumors and lots of press reports about a potential portable transition and we saw some slowing towards particularly the final weeks of September and the initial weeks of October. However, once announcing last week, we saw a considerable rebound in sales and we are very, very optimistic about those results. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and then just a final question for Steve -- any chance we can get you to make this a recurring event?\nSteven P. Jobs: Not likely, I\u2019m sorry. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, thanks. \nSteven P. Jobs: Peter and Tim do such a good job that I don\u2019t think I could add much. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Your next question will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Thanks for providing the non-GAAP results. That\u2019s helpful and really points to the power that the iPhone is having and clearly you are off to a phenomenal start there but Steve, can you talk about the bigger picture for the iPhone in 2009 when the field is starting to get more cluttered with iPhone wanna-bes? And how do you just big picture think about your roadmap for \u201909 and the phone?\nSteven P. Jobs: Well, I think we have to be the best and I think we have to not leave a price umbrella underneath us, and we are working very hard to fulfill both of those goals. And I think we are way out ahead of anybody else right now and we are investing a lot with the most talented people in the world to stay that way.  We have a great partner in AT&T and together I think we are both very committed to making the iPhone a great value for customers, so we\u2019ll be focused on all those things next year and beyond. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Can you give any sort of split in terms of phones sold in U.S. versus international?\nTimothy D. Cook: Not specifically, Gene, but I would tell you that there was a significant percentage international. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, and then just a final question -- Peter, last quarter you talked about the margin impact and the potential for these new products and it seems like margins once again were phenomenal and can you just help us understand, should we still be waiting for something or have we seen what happened and just the pricing environment was much more favorable than you had expected? How do we reconcile your comments last quarter versus what we are seeing right now?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, really the latter -- we\u2019ve introduced stunning new iPods and notebooks. They cost more and that\u2019s why our margin declined sequentially. As I told you 90 days ago, we don\u2019t talk about new products so it was hard to make the comments that I did and be clear, but you\u2019ve now seen what we\u2019ve done and I have provided guidance for 30% to 31% this quarter and we are going to continue to work to get down the cost curves over time on these great products. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. I guess one final question is did you actually see a deceleration in your business? I know that there was some anticipation on the new Macs but did you see any sort of deceleration towards the end of September or is the guidance just purely trying to be as conservative as possible?\nTimothy D. Cook: On the iPod side, iPod was up 8% for the full quarter, as Peter had mentioned earlier. In the final weeks of September and the early weeks of October, we were running flat year over year on a worldwide perspective and as we look forward, it\u2019s very difficult to predict whether the usual seasonal holiday lift will exist in the same pattern as it has before. As we said, forecasting is very difficult.  On the Mac, I commented that we did see what we believe were purchasing delays due to last week\u2019s portable transition and also the K-12 institutional business was down year over year last quarter. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Would it be safe to summarize your comments as that you have seen some sort of an impact, it looks like it\u2019s more a slow-down ahead of the Mac cycle and so it\u2019s less economy related and more just your general conservatism? \nTimothy D. Cook: It\u2019s difficult to separate how much was the purchase delay versus economy. It could have all been delay, it could be some part due to the economy. We just don\u2019t know. What we are very excited about is the rebound last week was great and -- however, forecasting that going forward with the visibility that we have is just very difficult. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Your next question will come from Charles Wolf with Needham.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Yes, I have a question for Steve and for -- well, for anybody but the performance of the iPhone was absolutely astonishing, but it was probably more so in this respect that most of the phones sold in the quarter were probably net activations as opposed to re-upgrades from the first gen. I was wondering, do you have any percentages on how many of the iPhones went to new users and how many, what percentage went to the first gen people?\nTimothy D. Cook: That\u2019s confidential information to our carrier partners but I would point out that we expanded the number of countries that we sold in from six to 51 and so there was an extraordinary amount of iPhone being sold to people for the first time. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Yes, well my point is simply that over half of RIM\u2019s sales, BlackBerry sales, are upgrades, not to new users, so I would argue that Apple did better than it would appear, given the numbers. \nSteven P. Jobs: We\u2019re happy just to -- we\u2019re just happy to beat them on a number-to-number comparison. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Well, keep it up, Steve. \nSteven P. Jobs: We\u2019ll try. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Okay, thanks. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Charlie. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Your next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. I have a question or two for Peter and Tim, and clarifications for Steve. For Peter and Tim, can you talk about the forces at work in terms of iPhone volumes for Q4? Typically, I mean, last year we saw iPhone volumes double in the calendar fourth quarter. You are also expanding distribution. Both of those are obviously forces that would suggest that the iPhone number could be considerably higher. Obviously on the flip side of that, you did have a stocking of your channel, which won\u2019t be as significant in Q4, and we have economic uncertainty. Should investors be thinking about strong seasonal growth in the iPhone for calendar Q4? And if not, why?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, we don\u2019t predict unit sales at a product level but what I would point out is that we did begin shipping in many more countries last quarter, from six to 51, as I had said, and we just launched the phone on July 11th, so we did have a channel build. That channel build was about 2 million units, as I had mentioned previously, and so that\u2019s something you would have to take into account in predicting our fiscal Q1 sales.  We will expand into more countries. We are on target to be in over 70 by the end of the year. However, the countries that we are expanding in are clearly have -- there\u2019s less opportunity in those than the 50 that we have rolled out so far, and so you\u2019d have to take that into consideration.  We are confident that year over year that sales will be up significantly. What they do sequentially, our crystal ball is not working at the moment and so we would leave that for you to predict. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then on the gross margin side, you are guiding for 30% to 31% for Q1 and you said that you expect to be able to ride down the cost curve as volumes ramp going forward. How does that -- how should we think about your previously stated guidance of 30% gross margin for fiscal year 2009 in light of those two statements?\nPeter Oppenheimer: In last quarter\u2019s call, I said that we anticipated gross margin being about 30% in fiscal 2009 and our guidance for the December quarter is consistent with that at 30% to 31%. As we look forward, we continue to anticipate gross margins of about 30% in 2009. We are delivering state-of-the-art products at price points that our competitors can\u2019t match and that\u2019s resulting in market share gains in each of our product areas.  We are going to continue with this strategy of delivering great products and making a reasonable margin but as Steve said, we are not going to leave an umbrella for competitors. \nTimothy D. Cook: Toni, I would point out, just to show the breadth of what we\u2019ve done, when we took Touch price down, we took it from $299 to $229 for the entry price and the units above it were moved $399 to $299 and $499 to $399, so significant price cuts on Touch. We also doubled the memory at the same price on Nano while providing an incredibly new design. Also on the notebooks, as you know from last week, the entry price went from $1099 to $999, and in addition, we brought MacBook Pro features down to the MacBook price range, which is essentially at $700 less than what we were offering before. And so we\u2019ve made an enormous round of cuts to provide more value to our customers. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: That\u2019s a good segue for the two things I wanted to just clarify with Steve -- Steve, you mentioned a couple of times that you thought there were extraordinary opportunities for companies with cash. I think you could hire almost every engineer in Silicon Valley on a lifetime employment contract and not really dent that significant cash horde that you have. When you made that statement, are you suggesting that there are significant opportunities for Apple outside of Apple, specifically in terms of acquiring companies?\nSteven P. Jobs: I just meant exactly what I said, which is I think there\u2019s going to be some significant opportunities. I think hiring every engineer is Silicon Valley is a good idea, though. Thanks. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then you had also mentioned the price umbrella statement and you said look, certainly to be successful on iPhone, we don\u2019t want to create a price umbrella. I think in response to another question, you also talked about extraordinary feature functionality in terms of your Mac products. Do you have the same philosophy around Mac as you do with iPhone, that you have to be careful not to create an umbrella in each? So I guess the simple question is should we continue to see more affordable price points across the Mac product family and across iPhone going forward?\nSteven P. Jobs: Well, I think what we want to do is deliver a lot, an increasing level of value to these customers. There are some customers which we choose not to serve. We don\u2019t know how to make a $500 computer that\u2019s not a piece of junk, and our DNA will not let us ship that. But we can continue to deliver greater and greater value to those customers that we choose to serve and there\u2019s a lot of them. And we\u2019ve seen great success by focusing on certain segments of the market and not trying to be everything to everybody. So I think you can expect us to stick with that winning strategy and continuing to try to add more and more value to those products in those customer bases we choose to serve. Does that make sense to you?\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Yes, it does. I mean, I guess, if I could follow-up, you did in this case add more value in terms of feature functionality with your notebook by actually lowering the price, so you retained the features but lowered the price. Certainly in terms of the new notebooks, you retained the price and added more features. \nSteven P. Jobs: Correct. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Can we expect you to continue to attract more customers by doing both, both adding more features at the same price and lowering price and retaining the same features?\nSteven P. Jobs: Well, we like to attract new customers but you will just have to wait and see. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Your next question will come from Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: If I could ask a question for Steve and then a quick follow-up to Peter and Tim -- Steve, how are you thinking about Apple TV now? You\u2019ve had a heck of a year. For fiscal year, you\u2019ve upgrade the iPhone, the iPods, and certainly the Macintoshes as well. If you look at the digital living room category and you look at the upcoming year of 2009, how do you look at the digital living room opportunity and how it relates to Apple TV?\nSteven P. Jobs: Well again, I think the whole category is still a hobby right now. I don\u2019t think anybody has succeeded at it and actually the experimentation has slowed down. A lot of the early companies that were trying things have faded away, so I\u2019d have to say that given the economic conditions, given the venture capital outlooks and stuff, I continue to believe it will be a hobby in 2009. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: And if I could switch quickly to tablet computing and touch screens, you\u2019ve made some comments about those in the past but when you look at tablet computing and you look at the new form factor for the Macs and those types of things, does that get to be a more attractive opportunity for you going forward here, now that the new Macs are out?\nSteven P. Jobs: I think we have such creative people that are looking at a lot of things but I really can\u2019t talk about any of the future products we are working on, I\u2019m sorry. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Okay, and then -- thanks for that, and Peter, when you talk about your expectations for the upcoming quarter, what\u2019s your expectation for meeting or getting close to equilibrium from a demand and supply perspective here in the first quarter of \u201909, and are there any credit issues in the channel affecting your revenue projections for the upcoming quarter, either in the U.S. or other geos? So it\u2019s a new product and it\u2019s a credit issue question for the guidance in the first quarter. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, I\u2019ll make a comment or two on the credit and Tim can speak about the first part of your question. You know, this is definitely a concerning environment from a credit perspective. Our treasury team has done just an amazing job with our cash. I was so proud to tell you in my opening comments that our mark-to-market, unrealized mark-to-market on the portfolio only increased $80 million sequentially on over $24 billion of cash, so they\u2019ve done a great job.  On the receivables side, we\u2019ve historically been very good in that area. We\u2019ve got good people. We stay on top of collections and we monitor accounts, I think as any company does. But it\u2019s a tough environment out there and we are being as careful as we can and hopefully we won\u2019t have issues in the future. \nTimothy D. Cook: Bill, let me take the three product areas and briefly comment on your question. In the iPod space at the end of the quarter, we were still filling the channel to get the new product at the right level in the channel. We\u2019ve now completed that but were not at the end of last quarter.  And the iPhone, as I\u2019ve alluded to before, we felt we ended with the right level of channel inventory and it\u2019s difficult to predict demand for the quarter but today I know of no issues in providing the right level of supply.  On the Mac side, we have significant backlogs on the new product and we are working very, very hard around the clock to fill those just as fast as we can and we\u2019ll see what the trajectory of demand is but I\u2019m confident that we can produce a lot. Whether it\u2019s enough, I don\u2019t know because it\u2019s hard to forecast the demand. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Well, if the fog lifts on October and your demand visibility gets better at the beginning of November, do you still have time to ramp your builds to affect the first quarter number then, from a supply chain perspective?\nTimothy D. Cook: We are obviously making bets on the demand already and -- so we are predicting. It\u2019s just hard for us to forecast for external consumption. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Okay. Thanks for the details, folks. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Bill. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Your next question will come from Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. Steve, you only have really one SKU in the phone biz, and the phone market is 10 times the size of the PC market, so I think you clearly as you said strive to be the best. At the same time, what might be the opportunities for further innovation or market opportunities within that market?\nSteven P. Jobs: Well, I wasn\u2019t alive then but from everything I heard, Babe Ruth had only one homerun, he just kept hitting it over and over again. So I don\u2019t think that -- I think the traditional game in the phone market has been to produce a voice phone in a hundred different varieties. But as software starts to become the differentiating technology of this product category, I think that people are going to find that a hundred variations presented to a software developer is not very enticing and most of the competitors in this phone business do not really have much experience in a software platform business. So we are extremely comfortable with our strategy, our product strategy going forward and we approach it as a software platform company, which is pretty different than most of our competitors. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: And I think earlier, there\u2019s been lots of discussion about limited visibility on whether there\u2019s delays to purchases or the economy. When do you think you get better visibility to things like Mac upgrade or uptake cycles versus economy related headwinds or changes in buyer patterns here, given so much uncertainty? Is that first quarter next year and is your price point comment about we are going to restrict ourselves to certain markets we want to play in, is that firm or are there alternative strategies you might employ if you don\u2019t get the upgrade cycles, or response to the price point stance that you are looking for?\nTimothy D. Cook: Mike, I think the answer to your question is different by product. On iPod, historically about half of our sell-through occurs in December and so the question of iPod visibility, we\u2019ll get a lot better visibility as we head into December on this quarter. Before then, the visibility will be limited.  In the Mac area, the question is how much was purchasing delay versus economy, if at all, and we\u2019ll gain knowledge on that each week but it will take some number of weeks before we are able to meet the demand in that space, and so I think it will take a little while longer. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Mike.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the highest June quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history. Revenue in the quarter was $7.46 billion, representing 38% growth and an increase of more than $2 billion over the previous June quarter\u2019s revenue of $5.41 billion. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by the highest quarterly Mac shipments ever and higher revenue from iPod, iTunes, and iPhone, which celebrated its first anniversary on June 29th.  Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 18.6%, due primarily to higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.07 billion, which was up 31% over the prior June quarter\u2019s results, and translated to earnings per share of $1.19.  Before getting into the details of the quarter\u2019s results, I would like to begin with a few points that demonstrate how well Apple has continued to perform. The current June quarter\u2019s revenue growth of 38% was significantly above the 24% growth rate we achieved in last year\u2019s June quarter and we continued to see healthy growth in all regions. Sales in our retail stores, most of which are in the U.S., were extremely strong, growing 58% year over year and store traffic was about 32 million, up 10 million from the year-ago quarter.  In looking at our performance for the first six months of calendar 2008, Apple's total revenue increased by $4.3 billion year over year, a very impressive growth rate of 40%. We are very proud of these results.  I would like to now talk about our Mac products and services, which represented 61% of our total revenue in the June quarter. We\u2019re extremely pleased to have shipped 2.5 million Macs, the greatest number of Macs shipped in any quarter in Apple's history. This translates into 41% year-over-year growth and is nearly three times the overall PC market rate of growth for the June quarter based on the latest estimate published by IDC.  Mac desktop sales grew sharply at 49% year over year, driven by strong demand for iMac which we updated in April. Sales of portables were up 37% year over year, driven by continued growth in demand for Macbooks and Macbook Pros, and the addition of Macbook Air to the portable lineup in January.  We\u2019ve been thrilled with the momentum of our Mac business. In the U.S. channels tracked and reported by NPD, Apple's share of total personal computers sold in the month of June increased to 19.5% this year from 15.4% last year, and it was the best Mac quarter ever for our U.S. education business, with unit growth of 25% year over year.  We were extremely pleased with our strong growth in both the K to 12 market, where we reached a new all-time high for quarterly Mac sales, as well as the higher ed market, where we sold more Macs than in any previous June quarter.  We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.  Now I\u2019d like to discuss our music products and services, which accounted for 33% of total revenue growth during the quarter. We sold 11 million iPods, an increase of 12% from the year-ago quarter, with the growth being driven by Shuffle as well as the introduction of the iPod Touch last September.  We were pleased with the iPod sales growth of 10% in the United States and 15% internationally. iPod revenue grew 7% year over year, less than the unit rate of growth, due to lower ASPs driven largely by the Shuffle price reduction taken in February. We\u2019re happy with the demand elasticity that we\u2019ve seen for the iPod Shuffle and think the tradeoff between ASP and units was a good one.  We were very successful in maintaining our high MP3 market share in the U.S. during the quarter and gaining share internationally. Our share is now over 70% in both the United States and Australia, over 60% in Canada, and over 50% in the U.K., Japan, and Switzerland, based on the latest published data from NPD, GFK, and BCN. We have strong double-digit share in numerous other European and Asian countries and we continue to gain share year over year in most countries for which we have data.  We began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.  The iTunes store achieved a number of milestones during the quarter and sales were once again very strong. As we indicated last month, we have now sold over 5 billion songs through iTunes and continue to build on our industry-leading catalog of content, which features over 8 million songs, 20,000 TV episodes, and 2,200 films, including over 450 in HD.  In the June quarter, we introduced new content from HBO to iTunes in the U.S., premiered movies in Canada and the U.K., and introduced television programming in Germany, France, and Australia. iTunes also began offering new movies from major studios and premier independent studios on the same dates as they became available on DVD.  During the June quarter, we shipped 717,000 first generation iPhones, and recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessories, and carrier payments of $419 million. As we indicated previously, because we announced the iPhone 2.0 software and its many new features on March 6th but did not make it available until this month, we did not begin recognizing handset revenue for any iPhones sold on or after March 6th until we made the iPhone 2.0 software available.  For those phones recognized -- for those phones, we began recognizing handset revenue on July 11th and we will continue to do so over the respective remaining terms of their 24-month estimated economic lives. Therefore, any iPhone handset revenue recognized during the June quarter relates to iPhones sold prior to March 6th.  We\u2019re off to a great start with the iPhone 3G. We have begun shipping in 22 countries. As we announced last week, we sold our 1 millionth iPhone 3G just three days after its launch, in contrast to the 74 days it took us to sell 1 million first generation iPhones. Customer reaction to the iPhone 3G has been overwhelmingly positive and we look forward to getting it into the hands of many more customers around the world in the coming weeks and months.  We launched the App Store on July 11th with a tremendous selection of innovative applications, such as games, advanced medical solutions, and robust productivity tools for the enterprise. The App Store currently offers more than 900 applications, with more than 20% that are free and more than 90% priced at less than $10. Customers are really loving the App Store and the iPhone and iPod Touch users have already downloaded over 25 million applications. We believe this amazing selection of mobile applications will continue to keep us years ahead of the competition.  I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which delivered very strong results with revenue growing 58% year over year to $1.44 billion. The store sold 476,000 Macs during the quarter, an increase of 44% year over year, and over half were sold to customers who have never owned a Mac before. The stores also provided a record high 598,000 personal training sessions during the quarter, helping customers to learn more about their Apple products.  We opened eight stores during the quarter, including our store on Boylston Street in Boston and our first store in Australia to end the quarter with 216 stores. With an average of 211 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $6.8 million compared to $5.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 33%. Retail segment margin was $297 million, compared to $184 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 61%.  We\u2019re on track to end fiscal 2008 with 242 stores. We opened our first store in Beijing this past weekend and we look forward to extending our international retail store presence by opening stores in Switzerland and Germany during the second half of this calendar year.  Total company gross margin was 34.8%, which exceeded our guidance by about 180 basis points as a result of several factors. First, we realized a net benefit to gross margin of about 70 basis points, primarily related to a one-time true-up of our contractor or contract manufacturer deferred margin. Second, the remaining 110 basis points resulted primarily from a better commodity environment, a richer product mix, and leverage from higher-than-expected revenue.  Operating expenses were $1.21 billion, including $112 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $118 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 29%, below our guidance of 31% due to a higher-than-anticipated mix of foreign earnings.  We generated $1.33 billion in cash during the quarter, ending with $20.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.32 billion. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2008, Apple generated over $5.4 billion in cash on $3.7 billion in net income. The primary contributor to the difference between our reported income and our cash growth is the tremendous cash generation from iPhone sales that has not been fully reflected as earnings yet due to subscription accounting.  Looking ahead to the September quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $7.8 billion, or approximately 25% growth over the prior September quarter. We\u2019re off to a great start with the iPhone 3G and expect to sell more iPhones this quarter than we have in any other quarter thus far.  Under subscription accounting, iPhone sales today will have limited impact on reported results in the quarter sold. However, those sales will build significant revenue and earnings that will be reported in future quarters.  We expect gross margin to be about 31.5%, reflecting approximately $23 million related to stock-based compensation expense, down from 34.8% in the June quarter. This sequential decline is expected due to three primary factors; first, the full quarter impact of the back-to-school promotion; second, a future product transition, which I can\u2019t discuss today; and third, the one-time true-up of our contract manufacturer deferred margin that we realized in the June quarter.  We expect OpEx to be about $1.270 billion, including $125 million related to stock-based compensation.  We expect OI&E to be about $120 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 30.5%. We expect to generate EPS of about $1.  In closing, we are very pleased with our results. We\u2019ve just reported the strongest quarterly Mac sales in Apple's history and have completed a fabulous first year with the iPhone. We\u2019re very enthusiastic about iPhone 3G, as well as the potential of the developer community and the App Store to provide outstanding applications to make the iPhone and the iPod Touch even richer experiences for our customers.  We expect revenues in fiscal 2008 to be about $32.4 billion, an increase of 35% year over year. We also remain very excited about our product pipeline and look forward to delivering more great new products later this year.  With that, I would like to open the call to questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Thanks. Peter, you mentioned quickly here future product transitions and its effect on gross margins. Is there a corresponding effect on revenue growth here that you are expecting in the September quarter? Because the September quarter revenue growth quite frankly looks conservative. Does the product transition affect revenue growth expectations as well? And then I just have a quick follow-up. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Okay. Bill, for the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $7.8 billion, which is 25% growth over last September. We have included in our revenue guidance the full quarter ASP impact of the back-to-school promotion, a future product transition that I can\u2019t discuss today, and also the elasticity that we\u2019ve seen from the iPod Shuffle price reduction and it\u2019s result on ASP.  I would tell you that we are very happy with our revenue growth and we\u2019ve just reported the best Mac quarter ever and double-digit iPod growth, and are off to a fantastic start with the iPhone 3G.  We expect to sell more iPhones this quarter than we have in any previous quarter, but this will have a limited impact on the September quarter but will build a significant revenue and earnings, which we\u2019ll report in future quarters. If iPhone sales were reported as revenue when sold, the September revenue guidance would be significantly higher. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Okay, thanks. And then a lot of folks are talking about Apple's penetration in emerging markets. Could you give additional color about sales outside the U.S. for Mac and iPod in particularly here? Any additional color in terms of where you saw upside surprises and then any additional color you can give preliminarily on the few days that you\u2019ve been out there in the China? Thanks. \nTimothy D. Cook: Europe had an outstanding quarter. Revenue grew at 43%, so higher than the overall company, and Japan for the third straight quarter has grown higher than the overall company this quarter at 40%. And Asia-Pacific continues to do extremely well, with a year-over-year increase in the Mac area of 53%. And so if you look at the Mac areas in each one, Europe was growing at about four times the market, according to IDC. Japan was growing at four to five times. Asia-Pacific was growing at two to three times.  In terms of some of the markets that you mentioned, we had several markets in the developing market area that were growing over 50% in revenue year over year, such as China, Russia, and Latin America. But surprisingly, we also saw some of the more mature markets growing at over 50% year over year, such as France and Germany and Australia.  So overall, it was a very, very strong quarter in every major geographic region. And the store is off to a good start in Beijing. We\u2019re very happy with what we see there thus far. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: And one last question, if I could, on the new stores; any change to your expectations here for store openings in the next 12 months?\nPeter Oppenheimer:\n : Bill, we\u2019ve not announced our plans for \u201909 but as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to end fiscal \u201908 at 242 stores. That is up 45 from last year. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Okay. Thanks very much. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Citigroup, we\u2019ll hear from Richard Gardner. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thank you. Tim, could you talk about how many Best Buy stores you added in the quarter? And then Peter, as a follow-up, it looks like you are still below your target range on Mac channel inventory. Is the target range changing or at some point should we expect the Mac inventories to get back to the sort of four to five week range that you\u2019ve talked about historically?\nTimothy D. Cook: We added about 170 Best Buy stores across the quarter. That brings us to a total of about 570, and we plan to be at around 600 by the end of the summer. Globally, we now have about 10,300 storefronts carrying the Macintosh, and that\u2019s up about 1,600 storefronts year over year.  And the channel inventory, we did end at three to four weeks. We still feel that four to five weeks is the appropriate target. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Ben Reitzes with Lehman Brothers.\nBen Reitzes - Lehman Brothers : Good afternoon. Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about gross margins? Obviously so good in the quarter, even taking out the 70 basis points, and then you are guiding to 31.5. Could we just talk a little bit about the changes in commodity environment, in particular maybe a little bit more about -- it sounds like it\u2019s more the BTS promo, back-to-school promo and the product transition excluding the true-up here, but could you just talk a little bit more about what you think components will do and why?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Let me start by just going through some of the factors that caused us to do a little better in June, what we see for the September quarter, and then Tim can answer your commodity question. And then I\u2019d actually like to follow-up after Tim does and talk a little bit about what we see in some future quarters.  In the June quarter, we did do about 180 basis points better than our guidance, and this was driven, as I said in my prepared remarks, by a one-time true-up that we had with our contract manufacturer deferred margin about 70 basis points. The remaining 110 was primarily driven by a better commodity environment than we planned, a bit richer of a product mix and leverage from the higher revenue.  As I look forward to the September quarter, I would see gross margin being about 31.5%, down from the 34.8% as a result of primarily three factors: first the full quarter impact of the back-to-school promotion that we are running; second, we\u2019ve got a future product transition that I can\u2019t discuss with you today; and then finally, the one-time true-up with the contract manufacturer deferred margin won\u2019t repeat.  Tim. \nTimothy D. Cook: Ben, on some of the key components on LCDs and NAND Flash, we expect a favorable cost environment. The DRAM market is entering a seasonally stronger demand period relative to where it\u2019s been and we believe that price will recover from these historically low levels until we see increases in this area.  Hard drives, optical drives, and most other commodities are in supply/demand balance and we envision these trends following historical norms. \nBen Reitzes - Lehman Brothers : Okay, so I mean basically though, it sounds like you guys may reprice or rethink about how you are pricing maybe with some of the transitions and you want to drive a lot of volume. Is there any change in the company\u2019s philosophy in terms of margin and volume, or stay tuned?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, let me talk a little bit about what I would see beyond the September quarter for margins. As you know, we can\u2019t discuss future products so the first part of your question, we\u2019re not able to answer today.  We\u2019re delivering state-of-the-art products at price points that our competitors can\u2019t match, which has resulted in market share gains in each of our products. We plan to continue this strategy and to deliver great value to our customers while making a reasonable margin but not a margin so high as to leave an umbrella for our competitors.  In addition, and one of the investments that we make is to introduce new products that initially cost more because they deliver an entirely new level of value to the customer. Then we ride the cost curves down with value engineering and volume manufacturing, leaving us far ahead of our competitors.  We have some of these types of investments in front of us that I can\u2019t discuss with you today and we plan to continue to execute this strategy in the future. As we look beyond the September quarter, we would anticipate gross margins being about 30% in fiscal 2009. We are very confident in our new product pipeline, our growth opportunities, and the decisions we are making for our future. \nBen Reitzes - Lehman Brothers : Okay, thanks. And then my last thing is just I would like to ask it as respectfully as possible; a New York newspaper today obviously called into question some issues around Steve and obviously his health, and we get a lot of questions about it and I\u2019m really sorry to ask, because it\u2019s a very private matter, but would you mind addressing the situation and just making it so we can have your official statement? And I apologize in advance for having to ask the question. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, Steve loves Apple. He serves as the CEO at the pleasure of Apple's board and has no plans to leave Apple. Steve\u2019s health is a private matter. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Pacific Crest Securities, we\u2019ll hear from Andy Hargreaves.\nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities: Could you just touch on CapEx? It jumped quite a bit in the quarter. Could you talk about what the spending was on and is the target still $1.25 billion in the year?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Our capital expenditures in the June quarter were $304 million. We spent $113 million in our retail stores and $191 million outside of our retail stores, in our IT areas, facilities, and some of our manufacturing. And we do anticipate CapEx for fiscal \u201908 being $1.2 billion, about $400 million in retail and $800 million in the other parts of our business. \nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities: And then I wonder if I could just ask about Apple TV really quick and wondering if you can give us any clue or any indication on the number of video rentals or how the launch of that service has impacted hardware sales?\nTimothy D. Cook: We started shipping Apple TV, as you know, in February and we\u2019ve been pleased with the sales that we\u2019ve had. However, the Apple TV remains a hobby, as we call it, because it\u2019s not -- this business is not nearly as large as the Macintosh business or the music business and does not have the potential of the iPhone business. However, we are very excited about the potential of it and continue to invest in it. \nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Andy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Needham, we\u2019ll hear from Charles Wolfe. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: I have a quick question -- what was the division of iPod sales between the U.S. and international?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Charlie, that\u2019s not something that we specifically break out but I can tell you that our iPod sales in the United States grew 10% and we grew 15% outside the United States. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: So I should be able to saw for it? Thank you. Thanks, Peter. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Charlie. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we\u2019ll hear from Gene Munster. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon. Obviously the iPhone is off to a good launch and seemed to be in line across the country and we\u2019re down to 2% of your stores have iPhones. Can you give us any sort of expectations beyond you\u2019re doing your best to refill the channel in terms of when we should expect to see a little bit broader inventory?\nTimothy D. Cook: The response to the new iPhone 3G has been stunning. As Peter said in his opening comments, we sold our 1 millionth iPhone just three days after the launch, and to contrast that, it took us 74 days to sell 1 million of the first generation iPhone and almost two years to sell our 1 millionth iPod, and so we are thrilled with what we see.  As you say, there are a number of stock outs. This is a factor of the overwhelming demand. I am very pleased with the production ramp, very pleased with the trajectory of it. We\u2019re shipping units as fast as we can and obviously we\u2019re trying to catch the demand and serve our customers.  We are confident enough in the production ramp that we will be launching about 20 additional countries on August 22nd, which would bring our total to over 40, and we still expect to be selling the iPhone in over 70 countries later this calendar year. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Would you be launched in some of those other countries if you expected stock outage in the U.S.?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, as I said, I like what I\u2019m seeing in the production ramp and I am confident in our ability to supply. I\u2019m not going to predict when supply will meet demand. We\u2019ve been selling the phone for 10 days and so this is a very difficult thing to do with this level of data. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: One final question -- can you remind us of the accounting on the iPod Touch, the accounting treatment?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure, Gene. We recognize revenue on all iPods when we ship them. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, so why is the phone accounted differently than the iPod Touch?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Because we are giving a way to current customers at no charge new software applications, an update to the software features when we make them available, and we are not doing that with iPods or Macs. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thank you very much. Just a question about your go-forward gross margin target of 30% in fiscal \u201909. Obviously that\u2019s quite a bit lower than what you\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years and I\u2019m trying to understand if that\u2019s more about pricing or mix or what else is causing such a steep drop-off. \nPeter Oppenheimer: David, as I said a few minutes ago, we\u2019ll delivering state-of-the-art products at price points that our competitors can\u2019t match, which has resulted in market share gains in each of our product areas, and we plan to continue this strategy into the future and deliver great value to customers.  And as a result of that, I would see our gross margins being about 30% in fiscal 2009 and I can\u2019t get into you what we have in our new product pipeline if we don\u2019t talk about future products. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: I guess I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle on the fact that -- I mean, you\u2019ve always been delivering the same type of products at those price points, with gross margins a few hundred basis points higher than that. So what\u2019s the change?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We have some investments in front of us that I can\u2019t discuss with you today where we are going to be delivering state-of-the-art new products that our competitors just aren\u2019t going to be able to match and as a result, I would see gross margins being about 30%, and that\u2019s all I can tell you at this point. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Okay. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, David. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: I wanted to go back on the guidance issue for a second; over the last three years, Peter, you\u2019ve generally guided from June to September to have revenues up 3% and EPS varied a little bit but down [18.9%]. In reality, the results that you\u2019ve delivered have been order of magnitude -- and those are sequential changes -- revenue has been up 10% and EPS has been in fact not down but up 9%. In each of those periods in September, you typically have price downs or reduction in prices. You always have back-to-school transitions. The only difference I heard this quarter was a reversal of deferred at the contract manufacturer. So still trying to understand what\u2019s different this quarter in terms of how this is going to play out where in fact you are going to deliver September results that are above where you\u2019ve guided from and historically, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happened over the past three years. If you could comment on that, please. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Keith, we gave you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving and we have a process we go through to evaluate what we think demand for our products will be and what we can make and what it\u2019s going to cost us, and we give you guidance accordingly.  I have guided revenue up this quarter on 5% from where we ended the June quarter. We are confident in our business. We believe we will sell more Macs in the September quarter than we did in the June quarter but we do see our gross margin being down, and I\u2019ve told you the three reasons that I think are primarily going to drive that. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay, well let me ask a follow-up then to Mr. Bailey\u2019s question -- when you were describing why gross margins would be down to 30% in the out-quarters, I heard you mention price a couple of different times during your prepared and follow-on remarks. It sounds like what you are suggesting is in addition to mix though is price is going to be one of the things that you think leads the gross margins down, because in fact you haven\u2019t been to those gross margins in over eight quarters. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Again, I can\u2019t talk about future products. That certainly could be the case and we also plan to continue to announce state-of-the-art products the deliver incredible value to our customers and we are very excited about what we have in our new product pipeline. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Keith. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Cross Research, we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Good afternoon. Maybe just a -- hello? Can you hear me?\nNancy Paxton: We can. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, good. Sorry, I\u2019m on an iPhone 3G, so I hope you can. Anyway, looking at the -- moving past the gross margin, maybe we can talk a little bit about operating profit or operating margin. You know, Peter, if you can give some idea of if you are focused on running the business for gross margin or actually for the gross profit dollars that fall off of it, therefore there\u2019s still substantial room for upside to EPS, even if gross margin gets compressed a bit. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Shannon, I think as I look back, I think the management team has made excellent decisions with our products and how we\u2019ve managed the business. With the guidance that we\u2019ve provided to you today, we expect our top line for fiscal \u201908 to be $32.4 billion, up 35% year over year from fiscal \u201907, which grew at -- which grew to $24 million. We\u2019re just getting started really with the iPhone. In the September quarter, we think we\u2019re going to sell more than we ever have, so I think we run the business very, very well, plan to continue to do that in the future. We\u2019re investing in the business but we\u2019ve been providing leverage from an OpEx perspective for some period of time now and would hope to do that in the future as well. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and then just one question, because obviously with the accounting on the iPhone, the cash is going to become substantially more important, so can you talk a little bit about use of cash, management\u2019s thoughts on cash, obviously given the relatively small return you are getting right now on your cash?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I don\u2019t have a change in our position to share with you today. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.\nMark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. Good afternoon. A few questions; Peter, I want to get back to David and Keith\u2019s question regarding the commentary on margins going forward. Is it safe to say then you are kind of suggesting, without announcing your new products, that Apple could introduce a more flexible pricing structure across the product lines in terms of not having the reputation of being the high-priced configuration provider of old? And maybe being a lot more volume driven, particularly on the Mac side of the house?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Again, I can\u2019t get in to what we will do in the future but as I look at our products today, I think we are incredibly well-priced from a competitive perspective. With the iPod, we start at $49 and go up to about $400, with many choices in between for customers, and I think we are as competitive today on the Mac as we\u2019ve even been in the 12 years that I\u2019ve been with Apple, so I\u2019m very comfortable with our pricing. \nMark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then Tim, could you help us understand how we should think about the longer term trajectory of your retail footprint overseas over time? I think you said 10,300 storefronts, but where do you see that going by the end of this year and next?\nTimothy D. Cook: That\u2019s obviously the channel numbers that, just to clarify for everyone, not our own retail store. I see it continuing to increase, because as we grow our market share, the Mac will need more coverage. It doesn\u2019t need the amount of coverage that iPod has, which has over 45,000, nor the amount that the phone will eventually have. But I do envision it continuing to grow. \nMark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: And then just lastly, I know it\u2019s very early here with the 3G iPhone but there seems to be a lot of buzz within the corporate IT houses regarding the phone. Can you maybe give us the sense in terms of what level of discussion has been stirred so far in terms of folks that want to fold in not only the iPhone but maybe even Macs into the corporate environment?\nTimothy D. Cook: On the iPhone, there\u2019s been a significant interest. As you know, about a third of the Fortune 500 were in our iPhone 2.0 Beta Program, and we\u2019ve got very large enterprises that, just to name a few, Kraft, First American, Disney, Genentech, Oracle, and the Southern Company who are all beginning to deploy iPhones within their organization. Also, there have been companies that are writing applications, and you can see some of these on the App Store, such as Salesforce.com with Salesforce Mobile and Oracle with Oracle Business Indicators, and there are many, many more enterprises that are writing custom apps for their particular enterprise. So we see significant excitement. Many of the carrier partners, as you probably know, have very large sales forces to call on these companies direct and they are very excited about pushing and evangelizing the iPhone in these accounts. \nMark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Peter, I understand this is a low base, but inventory did increase 50% sequentially, so is it fair to assume that that number normalized post the 3G launch?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Katy, the increase in inventories related primarily to a buy ahead we did to -- largely related to the launch of the iPhone 3G. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay, and then profits at Apple stores grew faster than revenue over the past few quarters. How are you thinking about continuing to flow that margin upside to the bottom line versus reinvesting in either store layout or resources to support what should be higher traffic, post the 3G phone launch?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, to date, Ron has I think really done a -- and his team a wonderful job of giving customers a great experience in the store and traffic just continues to go up. Again, we were up over 10 million people year over year to 32 million in just 211 stores that were open on average.  We\u2019re opening -- we\u2019ll open this year about 45 stores. Ron is remodeling some of the early stores that we opened to give customers a better experience, so we are making investments in the stores and he, with the revenue growth, has been able to provide some leverage, as you point out, along the way. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Jeff Fidacaro with Merrill Lynch.\nJeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: Peter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the operating margin impact, maybe in the September quarter, from the iPhone launch. In other words, what cannot be deferred along with the handset revenues?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. We incur our OpEx in engineering, sales, and marketing related to the iPhone currently, while recognizing the revenue over -- and product costs over a two-year period of time. And we do have launch expenses for the iPhone 3G that are built into the September quarter and that\u2019s provided for in the $1.27 billion guidance that I gave you. \nJeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: And if you can talk about also the rollout into different geographies, it sounds like you are doing another 20 countries by August 22nd. Do you intend to do them in blocks or is it going to be more linear after that to get up to the 70 number?\nTimothy D. Cook: The August 22nd one is a block, as I indicated, and we would prefer to do more in blocks but we\u2019ll likely have some of each as the year goes on to close out the year greater than 70. \nJeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: Great, and just one last follow-up, just on the App Store. Expectations here going forward, I know your iTunes has been generally run as break-even or better. You\u2019re getting a 30% split of the application revenue. Clearly this has done well over the -- just the initial launch. I just wanted to get your thoughts and your expectations as far as contributing to profits. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. We\u2019re thinking about the App Store in the same way that we think about the iTunes store. While it will generate some revenues, it will be a small profit generator, and just as with the iTunes store making iPods more attractive, we think the App Store will make the iPhone and iPod Touch more attractive to customers. We\u2019ll hopefully see an indirect return by selling more iPhones and iPod Touches. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Jeff. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. I have a few questions, please; firstly, can you comment at all, or do you care to comment on what\u2019s baked into your guidance around the health of the U.S. consumer? You are still doing phenomenally well in your stores but if we look sequentially, Mac units grew 67% last quarter; they grew 44% this quarter in your stores against a much easier compare. If we look at your store traffic, it was actually down sequentially from 33.7 million to 32. It looks like it\u2019s typically up between Q2 and Q3. Do these indicators mean anything to you and do you have anything baked into your forecast for fiscal Q4 that incorporates a view about the health of the U.S. consumer?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Toni, we\u2019re going to leave economic commentary to others but we didn\u2019t see any obvious impact to the business in the June quarter, and I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks just how we did at the company level but also in the U.S., in our retail stores with our iPods and our education unit, which had the best June quarter in our history.  We\u2019re certainly aware of the economic environment and we\u2019ve considered it among other factors in preparing our guidance. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then secondly, just in terms of the iPhone ramp, you mentioned that this was really a demand issue. Can you confirm that there have been no production or component issues to date? And if there haven\u2019t been, I guess the question is why wouldn\u2019t you push the launch date out one or two weeks so you wouldn\u2019t have created what appears to be widespread stock-outs, frustration among customers that they can\u2019t get it, et cetera? Was it just beyond the three standard deviation expectation for demand initially or -- so A, can you confirm that there hasn\u2019t been a production or component shortage issue to date? And then B, if that hasn\u2019t been the case, why wouldn\u2019t have business practice suggest that waiting to ramp capacity and launching in way that could have been more satisfying to more customers had been prudent?\nTimothy D. Cook: Toni, as I said before, the demand has been staggering almost in every country that we\u2019ve shipped in. And on the manufacturing ramp, it is right on schedule. We\u2019re very pleased with the trajectory of it and the confidence that that gives us to -- or it gives us the confidence to launch in 20 additional countries in August. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: I guess the question is why do you have such confidence that you can fulfill demand in 20 countries when you weren\u2019t able to fill demand in 22 countries at initial launch for more than two days?\nTimothy D. Cook: I\u2019m not predicting the demand. Demand is very difficult to predict with a new product of its sort, that has a new price point and it\u2019s a revolutionary product. But we do have confidence over the supply and it\u2019s the confidence over supply that allows us to continue to expand. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then the final question I had was just revisiting this gross margin commentary you made about going forward. My impression is that the iPhone is the significantly higher gross margin product than your overall business, and obviously that\u2019s going to ramp and all else being equal, should push up margins. I understand your commentary about \u201909, and you mentioned the word umbrella and you didn\u2019t want to create an umbrella, so I think the only inference is that you are going to be incrementally more aggressive on pricing on select products. But as we think about that over time, shouldn\u2019t the upward pressure on your gross margins later in \u201909 or beyond \u201909 be positive due to both the iPhone plus the scale economies that you had talked about?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Toni, a couple of things; first of all, I wouldn\u2019t rule that in or out and I\u2019m not going to make comments beyond \u201909. As regards the iPhone, we don\u2019t discuss specific product margins. However, the iPhone is currently a small part of our total revenue and gross margin, as a result of subscription accounting. And with the introduction of the iPhone 3G and our authorizing carriers in over 70 countries, we expect to sell significantly more iPhones this quarter and in the future than we have and we are very happy with the margins in our new model. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From RBC Capital Markets, we\u2019ll hear from Mike Abramsky.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. I guess they say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. We\u2019ve seen that already with a number of iPhone knock-offs that are proliferating, about to proliferate. I would imagine that it\u2019s going to be a very crowded fall season with a lot of choices for consumers, both in North America and outside, as they vie for similar kinds of user experiences that you\u2019ve been able to do.  What key sustainable advantages do you feel that you will have in that kind of environment to sustain the kind of demand that you\u2019ve seen for iPhone and support the kind of plans that you are expecting for expansion?\nTimothy D. Cook: We think that software is really the key ingredient for a great mobile experience, and we believe that we are many years ahead of the competition in this area. And so we welcome any competition, as long as it doesn\u2019t step on our IP. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Mike, I would add to that that we are very excited about our App Store, and as I said in my prepared remarks, in just a bit over a week, there are now over 900 applications available to customers and in just over a week, customers on iPhone and iPod Touch have already downloaded over 25 million applications. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Do you see this IP issue heating up later? How aggressive will you be in enforcing, for example, your multi-touch patent over what is obviously going to be globally a number of similar initiatives from other handset makers?\nTimothy D. Cook: We\u2019ll be very aggressive. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: How under-penetrated do you think this iPhone market -- excuse me, the smartphone market as it relates to iPhone is globally? This is obviously a product that does require a fairly high cost commitment from a number of users. We can\u2019t ignore -- we\u2019re not talking about economy, I recognize, but we certainly can\u2019t ignore the pressures globally. What evidence do you see that this market can support a sustained level of the kind of growth that you\u2019ve experienced out of the gate for this iPhone opportunity?\nTimothy D. Cook: Well you know, as I said before, we\u2019re not predicting units other than the prediction that we made some time ago about this year, which we are extremely confident in achieving. But we believe that we are growing the market and that many people really didn\u2019t have a full view of what a phone could do until we announced the iPhone. And so we think that there will be a shift in the phone industry over time to more and more people wanting a smartphone versus a standard voice phone. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: And would you say that you don\u2019t see the kind of cost commitment that is in front of people to get those new desires, to get the things that they are desiring being a headwind to market growth for the next foreseeable future?\nTimothy D. Cook: We did see it being a headwind at the $400 U.S. dollar price, and as we share some time about, about 50% of the people that we surveyed told us that they would have bought an iPhone had it not been for the price, and so with a change in business model, which gets the iPhone to a price of $199 in the U.S., and a price similar to that in local currencies on specific tariffs outside the U.S. in many countries, we believe we are addressing that key concern and the market for the iPhone will expand dramatically. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: And just lastly, are you reaffirming your 10 million CY08 iPhone goal?\nTimothy D. Cook: We\u2019re very confident in achieving the 10 million for calendar year \u201908. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Oppenheimer & Company, we\u2019ll hear from Yair Reiner. \nYair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: A quick question first on the back-to-school promotion. Can you walk us through the accounting of that and how you account for the iPods that are given away and what happens to the ASPs?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. In our retail stores, for example, if you are a qualifying student and you buy a qualifying Mac and an iPod, we will send you a rebate for the cost of the iPod, and again it\u2019s a qualifying Mac and iPod.  We account for the rebate as a reduction in revenue and it is done proportionately to both the Mac and the iPod in proportion to the revenue related to the Mac and the iPod sales. \nYair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: Got it. And on iPods, ASPs obviously down quite a bit in the quarter because of the higher Shuffle mix. Is this the mix that we should look at moving forward? And how do you see the overall iPod business developing now that it\u2019s clearly getting some competition, at least, from the iPhone?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We don\u2019t provide guidance at the product level. We were very happy with our iPhone sales in the June quarter. We grew 10% in the U.S., 15% internationally, gained share internationally, which we were very happy with.  As a result -- as regards the iPhone, it\u2019s hard to precisely tell but there likely was some element of cannibalization and our view is that if there is going to be iPod cannibalization, we want it to be from the iPhone.\nYair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: Got it. Just a final question on the gross margin guidance for the following quarter; I understand the comments about new product innovation. I don\u2019t quite understand why that would impact gross margins rather than OpEx and the R&D line; if you can help us think through that, it would be great.   \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. We have been introducing state-of-the-art new products that have technologies and features that our competition just can\u2019t match. And when we do that early in introduction, our costs are higher and then we work to bring costs down over time with value engineering and with volume manufacturing. \nYair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: So just to be clear, this implies that these new products will actually be shipping or being built in this quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I can\u2019t get into our new product pipeline but I have told you regarding the September quarter, that one of the reasons that we see gross margin being down sequentially is because of a product transition, yes. \nYair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Company: Okay. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Yair. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: With American Technology, we\u2019ll hear from Shaw Wu.\nShaw Wu - American Technology Research: Thanks. Just a quick question, I guess perhaps for Tim, just on the Japan business. It looks like it somewhat regressed this quarter, after some improvement over the last two quarters. Just any comments there in terms of how do you feel about that business?  And then just to revisit the iPod ASP question, understand that your back-to-school promotion definitely has some impact there but despite that, it seems like it was down a little bit more than expected. Is that a function of mix or is it -- would you attribute that to the back-to-school promotion? Thanks. \nTimothy D. Cook: Shaw, very happy with how our Japan subsidiary is doing. They are off to a great start in fiscal 2007. In each of the first three quarters, they\u2019ve exceeded the company\u2019s overall revenue growth rate and if you\u2019ve noticed that this past quarter, they grew at 40% year over year versus the company\u2019s growth at 38%. And I think that is particularly good when you think about how the markets there are doing.  In the PC industry, IDC was predicting a 5% year-over-year increase for the market. The Macintosh was up 23% in units, so up four to five times. Our share improved year over year from about 4% to 5%, and in iPods, our share grew about 10 points year over year, up to 56% in May, according to BCN.  And so we feel great about how we are doing in Japan. It\u2019s quite the turnaround from how we were doing in 2006. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Shaw, in your follow-up on your iPod ASP question, it was down sequentially really as a result of the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle on price decrease. The back-to-school promotion, while we started it in the first part of June, really will have its biggest impact over the summer months, so that didn\u2019t play a particularly large role within that.  And as we said, we are very happy with the elasticity that we\u2019ve seen on the iPod Shuffle and think the tradeoff between ASP and units was a good one. \nShaw Wu - American Technology Research: Thanks for the color. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shaw.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.  And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy and thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the highest March quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history. Revenue in the March quarter was $7.51 billion, an increase of more than $2.2 billion over the previous March quarter\u2019s revenue of $5.26 billion. The tremendous growth in the quarter was driven by very strong demand for Macs, higher revenue from iPod and iTunes and the continued popularity of the iPhone.  Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 17.5%, primarily due to the higher-than-anticipated revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.05 billion, which was up 36% over the prior March quarter\u2019s results and translated to earnings per share of $1.16.  Before going through the details of the March quarter, I would like to give you a few data points indicating just how exceptionally well Apple performed. Revenue growth in the March quarter accelerated to 43% year over year, which is more than twice the 21% growth rate we achieved in the March quarter last year.  We saw healthy growth in all regions, with the U.S. sales growing 40% and international sales growing 47%.  Sales in our 208 retail stores, most of which are in the U.S., were extremely strong, growing 74% year over year, driven in part by traffic of 33.7 million visitors, up 57% from the year-ago quarter.  In the retail stores, 50% of the CPUs we sold were to customers who were new to the Mac, adding growth to our platform.  And finally, our U.S. education business generated Mac unit growth of 35% year over year, its highest growth rate in any quarter in the last eight years.  I would now like to talk about our Mac products and services, which represented 59% of total quarterly revenue. We are extremely pleased to have shipped 2.29 million Macs, just shy of the record number of Macs we sold this past holiday quarter and representing 51% growth over the prior March quarter\u2019s results.  This is a 3.5 times the overall PC market rate of growth for the March quarter based on the latest forecast published by IDC, up from the 2 to 3 times market growth rate we have been reporting almost every quarter for the last three years.  Sales of desktops grew 37%, driven by strong demand for the iMac, as well as increased sales of Mac Pro, which we updated in January.  Sales of portables grew 61%, driven by continued strong demand for Macbook and Macbook Pros, both of which were refreshed during the quarter, as well as the successful launch of the Macbook Air. Macbook Air represents a new portable category for Apple and customers have responded very well to its breakthrough design and ultra portability.  We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.  Now I would like to discuss our music products and services, which accounted for 36% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold 10.6 million iPods, an increase of 1% from the year-ago quarter, and we experienced about the same seasonal rate of decline between the December and March quarters as we did last year.  iPod revenue grew 8% year over year from higher ASPs in every geographic segment due to the success of the iPod Touch. We continue to be very pleased with customer response to the iPod Touch and believe the introduction of the software development kit in late June will broaden this appeal even further as great new applications are developed.  After declining 17% year over year in the December quarter, Shuffle sales were also down significantly in the March quarter but the weekly rate of sales improved considerably following the February 19th price reduction.  We continue to achieve our objectives of maintaining our high MP3 market share in the U.S. and gaining share internationally. Our share of the U.S. MP3 market was 73% according to the latest data published by NPD. Outside the U.S., we gained share in nearly every market we have data for based on the latest information from GFK and BCN.  We began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.  Sales from iTunes were very strong in the quarter and NPD reported that we have surpassed Wal-Mart to become the largest music retailer in the U.S. The iTunes store has over 50 million customers and over 85% share of the U.S. market for legally purchased and downloaded music based on the latest information from Nielsen Soundscan.  Our movie rental service has been well-received by customers and we have also just begun selling TV shows in Germany and will continue to expand video content internationally.  We are very pleased with iPhone momentum and customer feedback continues to be outstanding. We remain confident in achieving our goal of selling 10 million iPhones in calendar 2008.  We sold 1.7 million iPhones during the March quarter and expanded our sales presence to include Austria and Ireland. Total revenue recognized during the quarter from sales of iPhone, iPhone accessories, and payments from carriers was $378 million. Total deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV was $1.93 billion at the end of the March quarter, compared to $1.44 billion at the end of the December quarter.  Developer response to the iPhone 2.0 beta software we announced on March 6th has been tremendous. Over 200,000 developers have signed up and downloaded the software development kit. Interest in the iPhone enterprise beta program has also been off the charts. We have received applications from over one-third of the Fortune 500 and over 400 higher ed institutions. Hundreds of companies and institutions have been accepted into the program and more are being added each week.  Because we announced the specific new features to be included in the iPhone 2.0 release and plan to provide them to iPhone customers as a free upgrade in late June, we will delay the start of revenue recognition for all iPhones sold on or after our March 6th announcement date until the iPhone 2.0 software is delivered.  The revenue and cost of sales associated with these iPhones will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of their respective 24-month estimated lives. Revenue recognition of handsets sold prior to March 6th and payments from carries has not changed as a result of our announcements.  I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores which had another terrific quarter with revenue growing 74% year over year to $1.45 billion. The stores sold 458,000 Macs during the quarter, an increase of 67% year over year. We opened four stores during the quarter to end with 208. With an average of 205 stores opened during the quarter, average revenue per store was $7.1 million, compared to $4.8 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 48%.  Operating profit doubled year over year to $334 million from $164 million. A primary objective in our stores has been helping people to get more out of their Macs and the stores delivered 580,000 one-hour personal training sessions during the quarter. We opened our 15th store in the United Kingdom during the March quarter and we looked forward to opening our first stores in Australia, China, and Switzerland in the coming months. We expect to open about 45 stores during fiscal 2008 and continue to be very confident in the investments we are making in the stores and the asset we are building.  Total company gross margin was 32.9%, which was a little stronger than our guidance due to a more favorable commodity environment, higher overall revenue, and a weaker dollar.  Operating expenses were $1.16 billion, including $112 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $162 million, below our guidance due to the lower interest rate environment.  The tax rate for the quarter was about 29%, below the expected 32% due to higher foreign earnings and lower interest income. We expect the tax rate for the second half of fiscal 2008 to be 31%.  We generated $1 billion in cash during the quarter, ending with $19.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2008, we generated $4 billion in cash from $2.6 billion in net income, the difference being driven largely by the iPhone and strong working capital management.  Looking ahead to the June quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.  For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $7.2 billion, or approximately 33% growth over the prior June quarter. We expect the total quarterly costs of non-cash stock-based compensation to be approximately $135 million.  We expect gross margin to be about 33%, reflecting approximately $20 million related to stock-based compensation expense.  We expect OpEx to be about $1.185 billion, including about $115 million related to stock-based compensation expense.  We expect OI&E to decline to about $115 million due to the impact of recent interest rate cuts, and we expect the tax rate to be about 31%.  We expect to generate EPS of about $1.00.  In closing, we are extremely proud of our growth and business performance in the March quarter. Our 51% Mac sales increase is the strongest quarterly growth rate we\u2019ve generated in almost two decades and 3.5 times the market rate of growth. We are very excited about the delivery of the iPhone 2.0 software in late June and the vast potential for compelling solutions that our SDK opens up for the developer community.  We remain very confident in our business and continue to be excited about the new products in our pipeline.  With that, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Ben Reitzes with Lehman Brothers. \nBen Reitzes - Lehman Brothers : Good afternoon. Thanks a lot. Nice revenue and performance. I wanted to ask you a little bit about gross margin. You know, 32.9 was really good but I was wondering if you had thought actually more could flow to the bottom line and what maybe some of the negative cross-currents were. And then also, what gives you the confidence of 33% the next quarter? Just a little bit more on that would be helpful, thanks, and then I just have a follow-up on iPhone. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, maybe I\u2019ll let Tim make a few comments about the commodity environment and then let me talk more broadly about gross margin in the March quarter and what we expect in June. \nTimothy D. Cook: Ben, commodity pricing in both DRAM and the NAND Flash markets hit historically low levels during the March quarter and we would expect that pricing in the current quarter to remain favorable, and we folded that into our guidance.  We believe that the LCD markets near a supply/demand balance and we\u2019ll have relatively stable pricing.  Hard drives, optical drives and most other commodities are in a supply/demand balance and we would expect these commodities to follow historical pricing trends. \nBen Reitzes - Lehman Brothers : And in terms of the quarter, did anything go against you though that was unexpected in the gross margin line, or was there an impact from the lower price of the shuffles that maybe some of us didn\u2019t anticipate? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Let me continue on and I\u2019ll address that and talk a little bit about the June quarter as well. As we commented in last quarter\u2019s call, we expected gross margin to decline by about 2.7%. We actually exceeded our guidance this quarter by 90 basis points and the gross margin only reduced by 1.8%.  And the better-than-expected results were primarily due to the favorable commodity environment that Tim discussed, higher revenue in the quarter, and a weaker dollar. The sequential declines in Q1 was primarily due to Leopard entering its second quarter of sales, and as we mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call and as we have seen in the past, a new OS has significantly more sales in its debut quarter. And the change in Leopard and the other Apple software sequentially accounted for over 80% of the gross margin decline that we saw, as we expected.  Other factors affecting gross margin in the quarter were the Shuffle price change; we took several international price reductions as a result of a changing currency market; a higher mix of iTunes, which has lower gross margin; and a sequential decline in the revenues from the holiday quarter, again which were expected.  These factors were somewhat offset by favorable component pricing, allowing us to achieve a gross margin of 32.9%, again which was ahead of our guidance of 32. \nBen Reitzes - Lehman Brothers : That was pretty detailed. That\u2019s good. In terms of the iPhone, just really switching up and then I\u2019ll cede the floor here, with regard to the iPhone we\u2019ve all noticed less availability, especially as we got towards the end of the quarter and recently. Is there anything -- and then we are widely expecting new products, but is there anything you can say that will give us confidence that you can grow that segment sequentially given the current amount of supply out there? Is there anything you are worried about and what not on the iPhone side in terms of shortages or anything? Or should we assume that you have a handle on that and can grow that business sequentially?\nTimothy D. Cook: We are confident on hitting the 10 million for the year. I think that would be the main point.  In terms of the shortages that you referenced, we expected iPhone to decline more on a sequential basis than it did, so we really beat our unit expectations and as a result, as we got toward the end of the quarter we started to experience some stock out.  At this point, both inventory in our stores and our channel inventories are currently low. Our U.S. stores have experienced more stock outs, or relatively more, and we believe the reason is that there are more phones being bought there with the intention of unlocking, which remains a significant number. \nBen Reitzes - Lehman Brothers : Okay, and you don\u2019t want to clarify that number this time?\nTimothy D. Cook: I can\u2019t clarify it. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to; it\u2019s that it is very difficult to come up with a very precise estimate of it, but we do believe the number continues to be significant and our view continues to be that this is a proxy for the worldwide demand of the phone, and our focus is very much on rolling out to more geos and we are on target to roll out into more countries in Europe and to enter Asia later in the year. \nBen Reitzes - Lehman Brothers : Great, thanks so much, guys. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move to Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: I wanted to ask a couple of channel questions, if I could. Could you guys give some more color on the direct versus indirect mix? And then also, could you give us any update on where you are with the expansion of the Best Buy footprint?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, the direct sales in the quarter were 53% and that was up from 49 in the year-ago quarter. \nTimothy D. Cook: And in terms of Best Buy, we ended with a little over 400 stores, which was to our plan, and we continue to target to be at 600 in the summer. The rollout is going extremely well and we are very, very happy with it. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: And then a follow-up on education, if I could; with education, can you delineate between student buy programs and institutional buying and education, what you experienced this quarter and what you experienced for the upcoming quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: The numbers that Peter quoted in the preamble, we were up 35% and both institutional and individual buying was relatively strong. The quarter that we are now in is a big K-12 quarter and of course back to school is more of a higher education quarter. I wouldn\u2019t want to predict exact numbers but as Peter had mentioned, the 35% is the highest growth rate we\u2019ve seen in ED in eight years.  And we recently learned that we surpassed Dell last year in the portables market share for higher education, so we have significant momentum in this area. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: And there has been a lot of chatter about state and local government spending. Are you guys happy with the institutional part of the education business?\nTimothy D. Cook: I am always worried about budgets and will continue to worry about budgets but the results that we have seen to date, with a 35% increase year over year, we have not seen any issue today. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Appreciate it, thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move on to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. Can you just qualify a little bit more the reasons for the delay of the start of revenue recognition on the iPhone and what your thinking was there based on the 2.0 release? And also, what kind of impact we should -- how we should think about relaying that into our iPhone numbers?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We are doing this -- as I said in my prepared remarks -- because we announced specific new features that will be included in the iPhone 2.0 software that we plan to provide for customers for free who purchased after our announcement on March 6th. So we will delay revenue recognition on phones sold between March 6th and the date of the delivery of the software.  Once we deliver the software, we will resume recognition, revenue recognition of the phones on what we sold between March 6th and that date and begin to recognize, as we had in the past, iPhone revenue on a go-forward basis. And as I said in my prepared remarks, this does not impact phones sold prior to March 6th or payments from carriers. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, so really what we are looking at is just the exclusion of hardware revenue next quarter, really from iPhone?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Until the software is delivered. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay and just on the iPhone with regard to your 10 million guidance, can you talk a little bit about how important either 3G might be to that or how important at least the timing of some of your pending products that you are referring to in your press release and on your excitement around the iPhone kind of weighs into that 10 million, based on current momentum?\nTimothy D. Cook: We don\u2019t comment on new products but I would just reiterate that we are confident with hitting the 10 million and obviously a part of that is rolling out to more geographies and we\u2019ve been working very hard at this and feel confident that we will be able to roll out in more places than Europe and to enter Asia during the year. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: And does that forecast include some now going forward assumption on your part of an unlocked phone percentage?\nTimothy D. Cook: The unit number includes phones of all types, locked and unlocked. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: And then final question, you haven\u2019t said anything in your call about economic headwinds. It\u2019s obviously something people are focusing on. It seems you are benefiting from resistance to some of those headwinds and also share gains. Any commentary you can offer in addition to the comments you\u2019ve made that help us understand some of the kind of sustained drivers of that?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We are going to leave economic commentary to others and we are focused on managing our business, which performed exceptionally well in the March quarter, and I credit it to just outstanding innovative products that drove amazing results.  The U.S. business performed quite well in March. Our revenue grew 40% and this growth rate was twice last year\u2019s March quarter U.S. growth rate of 20 and faster than we grew in the December quarter of 27%.  Mac sales in the U.S. were up 51% and traffic through our stores were up 12 million people year over year and we only have 208 stores. So look, we remain very confident in our business, in our strategy, and we will continue to invest in hardware and software products to delight our customers.  We read the same things that you do but I have provided guidance for the June quarter, which has revenue growing at 33% and again, that is an acceleration from the rate we saw last June by about 10 points. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. \nOperator: We will move to David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. I was wondering, did you give a date on when you are expecting to deliver the 2.0 software for the iPhone? And could you help us understand what impact that has on gross margin, if any?\nPeter Oppenheimer: David, what we said is we intend to deliver the iPhone 2.0 software in late June and I have included the delay in revenue recognition in the 33% gross margin that I have given you for the quarter. And again, this affects iPhone handset sales only between March 6th and when we deliver the software and it does not impact phones sold prior to March 6th or payments from carriers. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: But it is fair to say it does have negative impact on gross margin during that period?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, we will not recognize revenue until we deliver the software, and so that has an impact. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: And then just on your target for the June quarter, you have revenue down I think 4% quarter over quarter, and typically it is up. Is there any particular area that you expect to be sub-seasonal in the next quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, let me talk a little bit about it. We are guiding to $7.2 billion, which again is a 33% increase from the year-ago quarter and is an acceleration of about 10 points from what we saw last June where we grew 24%.  We factored several things into our thinking. First, our Mac channel inventory this past quarter did increase by about 60,000 in the March quarter, as a result of the Macbook Air launch and accelerated sales velocity.  Second, we will not begin recognition of new iPhone sales until we deliver the iPhone 2.0 software in late June, as I\u2019ve discussed.  Third, we expect a sequential decrease in iPod sales, as we have seen in the last couple of years, so nothing new there.  And fourth, we will see the full quarter impact of the iPod Shuffle and some international price reductions that we took in February.  So that\u2019s what went into our thinking but again, I couldn\u2019t be happier with the performance of the business. I think the guidance we are giving is very strong and would just end by saying again, it\u2019s a growth rate that is faster than what we saw in the year-ago quarter. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. \nOperator: We will move to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Good afternoon. I want to go back to the margin question because this is the first quarter that both growth and operating margins are down year-on-year since March of \u201906. Peter, do you feel that you now need to reinvest some of the margin upside to address the growth opportunities internationally and in some of the new product categories, such that year-on-year declines will be more of the norm going forward? Or was there something specific in the calendar for first quarter that will go away later this year?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Katy, again when we gave you our guidance in January, we gave guidance for 32% gross margin and we reported 32.9, so we did better than we thought, so our gross margin was better than what we had expected.  We are continuing to come out with new innovative products. It is a competitive world and we are thinking thoughtfully about driving growth both in our top and bottom lines and continuing to gain market share in all three of our product areas. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: And then Peter, just quickly, are you still planning to open about half of the new stores internationally this year?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I don\u2019t know if it will be quite half but our international store openings will be greater this year than they were last. As of the end of the quarter, we had 208 stores open in total and 27 of those were outside the U.S. And we\u2019ve increased our store opening forecast this year by a little bit to 45 stores for the year. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Great, thanks. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move to Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thanks, Peter, and Tim, and everybody, actually. I wanted to ask about the gross margin. I am still struggling to understand the gross margin that you reported in the quarter. I understand that you said that the decline in Leopard sales represented the biggest portion of that but it looked like from the segment data that you reported that Leopard revenue was down about $100 million sequentially perhaps. And so that would be about a point of impact on the gross margin sequentially. And given the price cut you did on Shuffle, it seems like that at most was another point impact on the gross margin. And yet since October we\u2019ve had DRAM and NAND pricing down 60% to 70% or more and panel pricing has been pretty favorable as well.  So I\u2019m just wondering if there was anything about the timing of when you procured the components that went into the systems that you built in Q1 that had an impact on the gross margin. In other words, was a lot of the NAND and DRAM that went into Q1 products procured in the December quarter? And if that\u2019s the case, should we expect to get some benefit as you procure a lot of NAND and DRAM now at much lower prices on the Q2 gross margin? Thank you. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Rich, let me -- I\u2019d like to make a couple of comments about some of the first things you said and then Tim can address some of your later points.  Our Leopard revenues in the December quarter as we talked about in January was $170 million, and they were just over $40 million in the March quarter. So together, a little over $210 million in the first half. Leopard is by far the best-selling release in our history.  But the sequential decline in Leopard and also iLife and iWork went into its third quarter, were a bit greater than what you thought, so the impact of sequential gross margin decline therefore was a little bigger.  And you also have to factor in, in addition to the pricing actions that we took, lower sequential revenue, so we had less leverage on fixed costs, and iTunes was a bigger mix of the business this quarter than last, and it has a lower gross margin as well.  So there were a number for factors that played into the gross margin coming down but again, it\u2019s better than what we expected it to be. We guided to 32 and achieved 32.9. Tim.\nTimothy D. Cook: I\u2019d just add, Rich, that the component advantages as you said were large during the quarter, and those really offset most of the later points that Peter talked about, which were the Shuffle price cut, the international price cuts that we did to adjust for currency, the higher mix of iTunes sales, and the lower overall revenue and the effect it has on the structure.  And so we did receive significant benefit, particularly in the DRAM and NAND Flash areas. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: And if I could follow-up, Tim, with one other question; you mentioned that you said that you thought that memory pricing would continue to be very favorable in the June quarter and yet in the case of both DRAM and NAND, we\u2019re at very, very low levels and in many cases for many suppliers, close to cash costs. What gives you confidence that the pricing will continue to be favorable here as we go into the second quarter and you and other companies start to procure more DRAM and NAND for typical seasonal build?\nTimothy D. Cook: To be specific here, favorable does not mean that it goes lower than where it was in March. It means that we envision it trading in a fairly narrow trading range and therefore not increasing that much as we head into the quarter. But I don\u2019t believe that it will go lower because as you say, many people are already charging -- certainly not absorbing all of their fixed cost in the current prices. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll move to Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.\nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Just a couple of quick things; one, on OI&E, is there anything aside from lower interest rates, given your cash flows, leading to a lower number? Two, can you give us a sense about what the delay in the iPhone recognition meant to the current quarter? Three, the tax rate, can you clarify whether it was down this quarter and this 31%, do we use that going forward? And last, just in terms of as you look at the consumer, obviously you had great numbers but are you seeing any impact on the consumer, are you taking steps to address that -- can you just talk about consumer behavior in general?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I may not get all of your questions so if I forget one, remind me and I\u2019ll certainly come back to it. I\u2019m going to actually just probably go in reverse order.  In terms of the consumer, we had a very good December quarter and we had an amazing March quarter and I in my prepared remarks wanted to go through some things that I thought would be helpful to you, and I think in a prior question I did, but I\u2019ll go back through just a couple of them.  Particularly in the U.S., our revenues in the United States grew 40% year over year; Mac shipments were up 51% in the U.S., basically at the level we saw around the world; and we saw about 34 million people in our 208 retail stores, most of which were in the U.S.  So our business performed exceptionally well in the March quarter across each of our customer segments, including our retail stores.  In terms of the tax rate, we had been forecasting 32% for the year. With a higher mix of foreign earnings that we saw in the March quarter and lower interest income really as a result of the rate environment, our tax rate for the year looks to be 31%, and so that\u2019s what we are forecasting for the June quarter and for the September quarter. And so in order to get the 31% for the year, we had an adjustment in the March quarter and that is why the tax rate was 29%.  And then I know that you had an OI&E question which I am going to let Gary answer, but was there one other before I turn it over to Gary?\nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Just the impact of the iPhone recognition in the current quarter, is there some way to quantify what that was?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, you\u2019ll have to make your estimates but we sold 1.7 million phones during the quarter. We made the announcement on March 6th. You know what we sell the phones for and we recognize the revenue over 24 months. Gary. \nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Just to clarify then, the number that you sold, that is still in the -- I just want to make sure I understand it. So that of the -- after March 6th, if you sold, you still counted them as shipments; you just don\u2019t show the revenue is what you are saying?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Correct. \nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: And Gary, just on the OI&E? \nGary Wipfler: I think you asked if there was anything else in the OI&E besides lower effective yields, and the answer is no. We are basically investing in a very short dated, high quality, highly liquid instruments and as consequence, the yield on our portfolio has dropped a little bit, 4.9% a quarter ago. We exited the last quarter -- we were earning about 3.9% and we expect it to go down a little bit more. And there wasn\u2019t any material write-offs in the portfolio. In regard to investments and auction rate securities and asset-backed securities, we don\u2019t have any of those. \nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Any further thoughts on cash use, what you are going to do with all that cash?\nPeter Oppenheimer: No change to announce to you today. \nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon. Hopefully one last question on the iPhone and the March 6th date; so you obviously recognize -- do not recognize the revenue after March 6th but you would recognize the costs and the expenses related to that, is that correct?\nPeter Oppenheimer: No, Gene. We will delay recognition of both the revenue and the product costs on the iPhone beginning on March 6th until we release the software, but we will continue to expense our operating expenses around selling and advertising and engineering as period costs as we always have. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay and then second is will you be charging for the upgrade for those who bought iPhones before March 6th for the version 2.0?\nPeter Oppenheimer: No, as I said in my prepared remarks, we will be providing that software to the then current iPhone customers for free. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. So then why if everybody is going to get it for free, why are you deferring after March 6th?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Because the customers that purchased the phone on or after March 6th presumably were aware of the software that we told them that we were going to come out with and that they were going to get it for free, and as a result of our announcement the way you properly account for that is to defer the revenue and that is what we are going to do. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: And just lastly as far as the inventory in the U.S. Apple stores throughout this quarter, should we assume that it will start to creep back up throughout the quarter, or should we just kind of assume it\u2019s going to be sporadic availability throughout the quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: We are shipping product every day, Gene, but I am not going to forecast the exact in-stock levels of the stores. But we\u2019ve factored in our current thinking of supply/demand into the guidance. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: A couple of questions; the first, can you talk a little bit about what we are seeing with the pricing at some of your European carrier partners with regard to the iPhone? Who bears the cost on this? Is this something carrier driven? Any commentary you can make on that?\nTimothy D. Cook: The carrier partners are free to price the iPhone as low as they wish and beyond that, I wouldn\u2019t comment on the specific commercial arrangements between us and the carriers because those are confidential. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and any thoughts on maintaining a 2.5G iPhone once the 3G is out?\nTimothy D. Cook: We don\u2019t comment on new products, sorry. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, thought I would try. You know, we\u2019ve got to try sometimes. Anyway, final question though is on the channel, because obviously your Mac sales were quite strong. Can you talk a little bit about where you are seeing the strength in the channel? Obviously you are expanding a bit more on your stores but from a CES standpoint or consumer electronics versus direct? And then also just any comment you can make about linearity during the quarter? Thanks. \nTimothy D. Cook: First of all, we are seeing strength in all geographies. It has been amazing at how balance it has been. If you look at the Mac, in the Americas we were up 52% year over year; in Europe, we were up 48%; in Japan, we were up 47%; and so it is very solid throughout. In Asia-Pacific we were actually up 62. And so these are obviously all multiples to the market growth.  Within each of those, the consumer appears to be very strong. Our pro business also had a very nice pick-up last quarter. The Mac Pro sold more units since it debuted with the new Intel processor. Education was up 35% in the U.S. And so overall, just strength everywhere. We felt very good. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and then linearity during the quarter for both iPhones as well as Macs?\nTimothy D. Cook: On the Mac side the only unusual thing in the linearity side was we started shipping the Macbook Air late in January. It was constrained most of the quarter and so a lot of those shipments did go out in the month of March.  By the end of March, we were at near a supply/demand balance on it. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and then just one final question -- well, actually, linearity on iPhone and then -- \nTimothy D. Cook: iPhone again, we really outstripped our supply toward the end of the quarter because we sold more than we had expected. We thought there would be a -- more of a sequential decline there than there was. It was reasonably strong throughout but March in particular was strong. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, great. And then just any indication you can give us with regard to Macbook Air on gross margins above or below -- I don\u2019t know, anything you\u2019d give us as a metric?\nTimothy D. Cook: The customers love it. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: So no comment on gross margins? Okay. Thanks. \nTimothy D. Cook: Not at the individual unit level. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move to our next question; Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Peter, when you in fact ship the SDK, is there a catch-up period for the phones that were shipped or is it all ratably from that point?\nPeter Oppenheimer: If I understand your question, Keith, we will begin to recognize the revenue and the product cost once we ship the 2.0 software over the remaining lives of the -- remaining lives for the phone. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: So there is no catch-up period, it will be ratably from that point?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ratably, yes, over the remaining life. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Fair enough. Okay, and then Peter, I want to go to the gross margin side. When I look at the year-over-year comps, gross margins were down about 220 basis points. You flagged some areas that were different on the sequential basis. Leopard would be out of the equation; in fact, software was a richer mix when you look at March to March. Could you just pick out a couple of the other large drivers of change on a year-over-year basis? And particularly if you could identify whether the mix between CPUs and iPods was favorable or unfavorable. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Keith, it is really hard for me to do year-over-year gross margin comparisons because you\u2019ve got your different points and your product cycles, different commodity cycles, different mix. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve traditionally talked about gross margin on a sequential detail and I would prefer to just stick with the sequential comments that I gave you, which again gross margin was better than what we thought it would be. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Fair enough. Then last question for me then, Peter, if you -- you have your operating segments and if you thought about is there a deviation in the operating segments and the amount of gross margin they report by geography? In other words, was the variance in terms of the individual geographies materially different than what you had as a company as a whole?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We\u2019ll put out the 10-Q in the next week or so and our segment reporting at the gross margin level will be there. You can look at prior 10-Qs to see the different gross margins in the segments. And there\u2019s a little bit of variability but we are quite happy with each of our segments. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay, I\u2019ll cede the floor. Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move to Shaw Wu with American Technology. \nShaw Wu - American Technology Research: I just had a question on your acquisition of PA Semi -- any comments or color you can give around that? Thanks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Shaw, we occasionally buy smaller technology companies from time to time and we don\u2019t have a practice of commenting on our purpose or plan, so I can\u2019t. \nShaw Wu - American Technology Research: Okay, thanks. \nOperator: We have Jeff Fidacaro from Merrill Lynch.\nJeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: Peter, I was wondering if you could touch on the Mac side. When you take a look at PC unit growth, typically it\u2019s down quarter over quarter in the calendar second quarter. Given your strength has accelerated to about three times the market growth, I wonder if you could highlight any comparable seasonality in the Mac business in your June quarter. \nPeter Oppenheimer: What we generally see in June is a sequential increase in Mac shipments as the education buying season begins and the June quarter tends to be more heavily weighted to K-12, which buys typically at lower ASPs, and the September quarter tends to be more heavily weighted within the ED buying season by higher education. \nJeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: And just one follow-up; if I move over to the iPhone, when you look at the unlocked or non-activated phones in the prior quarter, some of that was gifts that were bought late in the holiday season. Have you seen any change in behavior from the carryover from that December quarter? Were they actually activated? Have you seen any significant changes?\nPeter Oppenheimer: As Tim commented, it\u2019s really hard to estimate precisely and we don\u2019t want to throw a number out. Unlocking is occurring and it is significant but our view is that this is -- it\u2019s just a clear interest in demand globally for the iPhone and we think it -- we are hearing reports of iPhones being used in many countries and this is one of the things that gives us confidence in our goal of shipping 10 million in calendar 2008. \nJeff Fidacaro - Merrill Lynch: Thank you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. I was hoping you could reconcile your statement that iPhone demand was outstripping supply at the end of the quarter with what appears to be an excess supply in most European countries of the phone. You indicated that they can price as they want and we are seeing price cuts of over 50% on the phone, which certainly doesn\u2019t sound like a situation where they are under-supplied.  Were you seeing a noticeably different demand profile in the U.S. relative to your expectations versus Europe? And if so, why couldn\u2019t you simply ship phones from what appears to be an overstocked Europe to the U.S. to fulfill that demand?\nTimothy D. Cook: Tony, my point was that stock-outs were occurring in our own stores toward the end of the quarter and we believe that was because our stores are more susceptible to people going in and buying multiple units and then unlocking and exporting them.  However, I also added that currently inventories are low in both our stores and in the channel. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And is that also the case in your European channel or is that an aggregate channel statement?\nTimothy D. Cook: I don\u2019t want to be specific at the carrier level but I the aggregate, Europe is low. In the aggregate, the U.S. is low. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And at the very end of the quarter where you were having stock-outs in your own stores, was your channel inventory also low? Because it seemed like the phones were readily available in Europe and through AT&T stores, which obviously beg the question of why were you not able to better balance the allocation of phones, particularly towards the end of the quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: Once the units are already shipped and designated to a carrier, the ability to move them from carrier to carrier is very low. And so you can have very short-term cases where there is some imbalance. But I think the major point is that we sold more than we thought we would and that today, inventories are low and in aggregate in Europe and in aggregate in the U.S. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Can you comment on whether you thought you sold more in Europe than you thought you would?\nTimothy D. Cook: No, I\u2019m just going to comment that in total, that we sold more than we expected. We expected a sharper seasonal decline than what we experienced and as you know, this was our first Q1 to Q2 that we\u2019ve been in the phone business, and so we\u2019ve learned something. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then staying with the phone, I know a couple of other people have asked but last quarter on this call, you said you weren\u2019t comfortable discussing the unlocked percentage because of the high concentration of phones that had been sold at the very end of December and the holiday season and that you felt you\u2019d get a better read on that in January. Invariably you have gotten a better read on that, and so given that you had given out the number before, or an estimate of that number, why the reticence now give at least for last quarter you should have ample ability to be able to quantify that?\nTimothy D. Cook: We don\u2019t feel that we can quantify it with precision, and so we don\u2019t want to put out a number that we can\u2019t stand behind. But we\u2019ve gone out of our way to classify the number as significant. I\u2019m not sure how to be more clear than that. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then switching to Macs, your notebook ASP declined sequentially and year over year, given that you introduced the Macbook Pro which sounded like got off to a good start, and you also mentioned strength in Macbook pros. Were those both relatively small and were price cuts relatively big? Or how do we reconcile the ASP decline?\nPeter Oppenheimer: The ASP decline was slight, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis and they were largely driven by the transition that we had in the quarter and some mix shifts within our Macbook and Macbook Pro lines. But again, they were small. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Thank you very much. \nOperator: We\u2019ll move to Charles Wolf with Needham & Company.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: I have a couple of questions; one is do you have any color that you can provide on the demographics of Macbook Air purchases? You know, I originally thought it would be for road warriors but the numbers suggest it is selling far better than that.  And sort of in the same vein, do you have any sense of how many Window users purchased a Macbook Air?\nTimothy D. Cook: We don\u2019t on the latter, Charlie. What we would share is that it is appealing to all sorts of people, from college professors to students to people that travel a lot. It seems to have universal appeal and also the cannibalization factor was extremely low to the other portables, which is one of the key reasons we were able to have a very minor sequential decline from Q1, where usually it would be much deeper. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Charlie and thanks to everyone for joining us.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, Madam. \nNancy Paxton : Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer and he\u2019ll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts.  Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today may consist of forward-looking statements regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes and earnings. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2007 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today in the attached press release.  Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report our best quarter ever, with the highest revenue and earnings in Apple's history.  Revenue grew 35% year over year to $9.6 billion, an increase of almost $2.5 billion over the previous December quarter\u2019s record-breaking results. The revenue growth was driven by record Mac, iPod, and iPhone sales and strong demand for our recent software releases.  Our domestic business performed very well, with revenue growing 27% year over year and we were especially pleased with our international business, which grew 46% year over year.  Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 22.1%, resulting primarily from higher-than-anticipated gross margin and revenue. Net income was $1.58 billion, which was up 57% over the prior December quarter\u2019s results and translated to earnings per share of $1.76. Cash generation for the quarter was over $3 billion, or approximately two times net income.  I\u2019d like to first talk about our Mac products and services, which represented 47% of total quarterly revenue. We are extremely pleased to have shipped 2.32 million Macs, exceeding the previous December quarter shipments by over 700,000 units and representing 44% year-over-year growth. That\u2019s more than 2.5 times the overall market rate of growth for the December quarter based on the latest forecast published by IDC.  Sales of the new iMac we announced in August continued to be very robust, helping drive 53% year-over-year growth in desktop systems. Sales of portables were also strong, increasing 38% year over year. We began and ended the quarter with less than three weeks of Mac channel inventory.  We are extremely pleased with the very successful launch of Leopard on October 26th and the response from both customers and reviewers has been terrific. Total Leopard revenue was about $170 million during the quarter, a significant increase from about $100 million in revenue generated by the Tiger release in its first quarter. We believe that 19% of the Mac OS 10 installed based is already using Leopard.  Now I\u2019d like to discuss our music products and services, which accounted for 50% of total revenue during the quarter. We sold over 22.1 million iPods, surpassing the record levels sold in the year-ago quarter. We began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.  One of our primary goals for this holiday season was to establish an entirely new type of iPod in the marketplace, the iPod Touch. This new iPod has the potential to grow the iPod from being just a music and video player into being the first mainstream WiFi mobile platform running all kinds of mobile applications.  Because of the higher cost associated with the large touch screen and more powerful processor required to run applications like Safari, this was the most expensive iPod we\u2019ve brought to market for some time. So we had the challenge of establishing a completely new type of iPod at the top of the line at a price point above where we\u2019ve been for quite some time, and we succeeded.  In addition to selling very successfully, the iPod touch was responsible for the overall increase in iPod ASPs to $181, which drove revenue up 17% year over year. Last week we announced a major software upgrade for the iPod Touch, including five great mobile applications and the ability to watch iTunes movie rentals on its gorgeous screen.  According to the latest data from NPD, iPod\u2019s share of the U.S. market for MP3 players in the December quarter was consistent with the year-ago quarter and in international markets, according to GFK, we continued to gain market share year over year in virtually all European and Asian countries.  We were very pleased with the iPhone momentum and customers continued to rave about their iPhones. We sold over 2.3 million iPhones during the quarter and executed successful launches in the U.K., Germany, and France. Total revenue recognized during the quarter from sales of iPhone, iPhone accessories, and payments from carriers was $241 million. Total deferred revenue from iPhone and Apple TV was $1.44 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $636 million at the end of the September quarter.  I would like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also posted record quarterly results. Revenue was $1.7 billion, representing 53% year-over-year growth. The stores generated $405 million in segment margins compared to $259 million in the year-ago quarter. We opened our third store in Manhattan on West 14th street, which is off to a great start and devotes an entire floor to the Genius Bar, personal training, and pro lab.  We opened six other new stores during the quarter, ending with 204 stores. With an average of 201 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $8.5 million compared to $6.6 million in the year-ago quarter.  The stores sold a record 504,000 Macs during the quarter, representing 64% year-over-year growth. Once again, over 50% of the customers buying Macs in our stores during the quarter were new to Mac.  Store traffic hit a new record with 38.4 million visitors during the quarter, representing 14,700 visitors per store per week, an increase of over 10 million visitors from the prior December quarter.  Our stores continued to innovate and provide outstanding customer service. The new concierge teams that were added to all stores were exceptionally well-received by customers and helped direct traffic to the store\u2019s personal shoppers, express bays, genius bars, and studios for training and other services.  The stores delivered over 300,000 personal training sessions during the quarter, a new all-time high.  Total company gross margin was 34.7%, which was stronger than expected due to a more favorable commodity environment, stronger software sales, higher overall revenue, and a weaker U.S. dollar.  Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, including $92 million in stock-based compensation expense. We capitalized only $1 million of software development expense related to Leopard during the quarter compared to $22 million in the September quarter. OI&E was $200 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 32%.  We had very strong cash generation during the quarter, increasing our cash balance by over $3 billion to end with over $18.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $2.76 billion.  Looking ahead to the March quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.  For the quarter, we are targeting revenue of about $6.8 billion or approximately 29% growth over the prior March quarter. We expect the total quarterly cost of non-cash stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $135 million.  We expect gross margin to be about 32%, reflecting approximately $20 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We are guiding gross margin down sequentially primarily as a result of two factors. First, we expect a sequential decline in software sales as Leopard enters its second quarter and iLife and iWork enter their third quarters. Second, we expect sequentially lower revenue due to seasonality as we\u2019ve seen in past years.  We expect OpEx to be about $1.12 billion, including about $115 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $190 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 32%. We expect to generate EPS of about $0.94.  In closing, we are extremely proud of our record December quarter results as we reached new highs in product shipments, revenue, and profitability. We believe these outstanding results reflect the excellence of our innovative products and we are very proud of the growth we have achieved. We are very enthusiastic about our announcements in the first two weeks of 2008, including MacBook Air, iTunes movie rentals, new software for iPhone and iPod Touch, and the updated Mac Pro.  We remain very confident in our product pipeline and look forward to the rest of 2008.  With that, I would like to open the call to questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: If I just look at your revenue guidance for the March quarter, over the last few years the decline was pretty consistently a 25-point decline in March and yet you are guiding for something worse than that. And if I look at the mix of Macs, which is increasing year-on-year and clearly PCs experienced less of a sequential decline than CE products like MP3 players, it would suggest you should actually see better seasonality all else equal in the March quarter. So if you can just walk through why your outlook is suggesting worse seasonality than what we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. \nPeter Oppenheimer: I think that the guidance that we have projected of $6.8 billion is up 29% year over year. We provide you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. We remain very confident in our business and our products and our strategy. Macs just had a terrific quarter. We were up 44% year over year. We\u2019ve had some great announcements at MacWorld, so as I look forward, we remain very confident in the business and the guidance that we\u2019ve provided at 29% is actually up from what we did in the year-ago quarter in March where we grew 21%. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Let me just follow-up; I believe you gave the channel inventory levels for iPods. Can you give a picture of where Mac channel inventory stands today?\nTimothy D. Cook: We ended the quarter below our target range and we started the quarter below our target range. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay, great, thanks. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And that comes from FTN Midwest, Bill Fearnley.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Yes, thanks. Could I ask another follow-up question on Macintosh here? When you look at the pro segment, now that you have Creative Suite, larger monitors, and more powerful Macs, since they\u2019ve been available, what did that do to the Macintosh business if anything for the quarter? And does that color your outlook here for the upcoming quarter at all?\nTimothy D. Cook: Generally the Macintosh business is on fire. We\u2019ve done 44% year over year. The Mac business has incredible momentum. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: But particularly to the pro segment though. \nTimothy D. Cook: The pro segment itself, the part that we can measure the best, which is around pro audio software and video, pro audio was up very significantly year over year and the video business continued to perform very well. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Okay, and what were the effects of the iPhone rebate redemptions during the quarter, if anything? Anything significant?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, I think customers really appreciated that we provided the $100 credit. The impact of that at this point is largely behind us and we saw that in both the September and the December quarter. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: And then one last, if I could; on the iPhone unit expectations for 2008, are you guys providing any type of update on that today? Thanks. \nTimothy D. Cook: We remain very confident in hitting the 10 million goal for 2008. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll hear from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions; could you just give a little bit more detail on what your inventory targets are in the channel in terms of weeks? And it seems that you implied that you are unable to meet all of the demand that was out there. Can you give us some more detail on where you might have come up short, either by geo or product line?\nTimothy D. Cook: David, are you talking about the Macintosh specifically? \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Yes. \nTimothy D. Cook: As you know, our target for the Mac is to be between four and five weeks of inventory and we did not end the quarter within that range. We ended it significantly less than the range. We did that because Macintosh sales were much higher than we anticipated for the quarter, had tremendous momentum throughout the quarter and we are obviously trying to remedy that situation now. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: And do you think you can get back within the four to six week range, four to five week range by the end of March?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, we don\u2019t forecast channel inventory but Peter has given you our guidance and embedded in that is our supply and demand forecast. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Okay, and then just on the iPods, it looks like units were up only sort of in the mid-single-digits year over year, yet you gained some share. Are we reaching a saturation point for MP3 players or is there still room to grow there?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We view the iPod market as bigger than a market for just simple music players. This is one of the reasons we developed the iPod Touch and we believe that one of the iPod\u2019s future direction is to become the first mainstream WiFi mobile platform.  As I indicated in my prepared remarks, the Touch is off to a great start. We really succeeded in the introduction and it played a big role in our growing revenue 17% year over year, and we don\u2019t think that revenue growth like this is characteristic of a saturated market. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, David. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And we\u2019ll hear from Bill Shope with J.P. Morgan.\nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Great, thanks. Can you give us any sense of whether you are seeing any cannibalization at all yet going on between the iPod and the iPhone? I know last quarter you said you didn\u2019t have enough data. I was wondering if you had enough incremental data now to make a judgment there. \nTimothy D. Cook: When we look at the U.K., France, and Germany, there is no obvious evidence of cannibalization at all. In the U.S. where iPod unit sales were flat year over year, it could have been one of the factors but other factors played into that as well, so it is very difficult to say with any precision whether there was cannibalization or not. \nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then can you give us any color on inventory levels for iPhones exiting the quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: We\u2019re not providing specific iPhone inventories. As you know, we have one channel partner for each country and we\u2019re employing our proven systems and processes with iPhone to manage inventory efficiently, just like we do with Mac and iPod. \nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Okay, and then one final question, looking at the ASP trends for iPods, obviously that was a big help this quarter. Do you think we, given the success of the Touch, we should see the ASP trends hold in that level going forward? Or at least going into the March quarter, is that implied in your guidance?\nTimothy D. Cook: We don\u2019t forecast ASPs but as you indicated, the iPod ASP did increase sequentially and year over year and that was a result of a very successful introduction of the iPod Touch. And we just updated the iPod Touch now to include five great mobile applications and the ability to watch movies from the iTunes store and we think that our customers are really loving the product. \nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Thanks, guys. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll hear from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thanks very much. I have two questions. First of all, could you comment at all on the linearity of iPod sales throughout the quarter relative to normal seasonality? And the reason I ask the question is that NPD data suggests a weakening in sell-through for iPod during the month of December this year. I\u2019m just wondering if that contributed to any sort of rise in iPod inventories within that four to six week range that you talked about during the quarter, and then a follow-up. \nTimothy D. Cook: When you look at the demand curve across the quarter, on a worldwide basis the curve was very similar to the curve that we saw last year. In the U.S., what you are referencing on the NPD data is that in the gift-buying season, back-loaded in that November and December, we saw a slightly different curve than we did last year but that was made up for in our very, very good growth internationally. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Tim or Peter, are you at all concerned that that might be indicative of where the U.S. economy is heading and where consumer demand is heading? And have you factored that into your guidance for the March quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving, so no change.  In terms of the economy, we\u2019ll leave the economic forecasting to others and we are focused on managing our business. The business performed very well in the December quarter, with revenue in the United States growing 27% year over year. This growth rate was actually faster than last year\u2019s December quarter, which grew at 21% in the U.S. and for fiscal \u201907 in the U.S., it grew at 23%.  In the December quarter, our U.S. Mac sales were 43% year over year and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the traffic in the retail stores was amazing. Most of the stores are in the U.S. and our traffic grew by over 10 million customers year over year. As we look outside the U.S., we were thrilled with the business, which grew 46% year over year in the December quarter.  So we remain very confident in our strategy and our business and we are going to continue to invest to innovate in hardware and software products that delight customers and continue to improve the buying experience, both in our stores and in the channel. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thank you, Peter, and then one final question on share buy-back; you now have $18.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet, no debt, and you are going to generate probably a minimum of $1 billion in free cash flow per quarter this year, and arguably the predictability of your earnings will rise over time as iPhone produces more of an annuity like profit stream for you. Could you talk about how this factors into the Board\u2019s potential decisions regarding uses of cash and share buy-back?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Well, Rich, as you said, the cash generation of the business on the December quarter was very, very strong. We -- cash went up by over $3 billion, of which $2.76 billion came from operations and we are I think managing the business very, very well.  Stock buy-back programs and other forms of returning the cash are discussed with the Board from time to time but our preference continues to be to maintain a strong balance sheet in order to preserve our flexibility to make strategic investments and/or acquisitions. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question will come from Ben Reitzes, UBS.\nBen Reitzes - UBS: Good afternoon. Thank you. Peter, I want to ask the guidance question another way. Last year on the same conference call a year ago, you guided down about 52% or so sequentially and then came in at $0.87, down only 24% sequentially in terms of EPS. This year you guide down actually better rate at down 47%, so the guidance in my opinion on the EPS, it\u2019s kind of hard to get a feel for how you really feel. I mean, do you feel pretty much like the same as last year, that the good things are ahead of you and the product pipeline is as exciting as last year? Is there anything else qualitatively besides your earnings guidance that could give us a feeling for how you feel going forward? Products maybe, anything. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. I\u2019ll tell you -- I am very confident in our business, our strategy, and our products. We have just fantastic products that are available to customers today. We are very confident about what\u2019s in the product line. We are innovating. We are delighting customers. We are gaining share and I just couldn\u2019t be more proud of the Apple team and confident in what we are doing. And as regards to the guidance, we gave you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving and our focus is on managing the business. \nBen Reitzes - UBS: Okay, just moving on, the MacBook Air, kind of a new thing -- do you think that will be incremental in terms of your Mac units, or do you think it will cannibalize part of the pro and MacBook lines? How should we look at that product in terms of additive or not to your line going forward?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, Ben, we\u2019ve just announced it, as you know, last week. The customer reaction has been great. The orders are very strong for it but it\u2019s too early to tell before we are shipping the item of the cannibalization factor on the other notebooks. \nBen Reitzes - UBS: Okay, and then what in your guidance are you thinking about for iPods? Maybe you don\u2019t want to go by product line, but it sounded like you said other factors in the quarter contributed to the flat growth in the U.S. I\u2019m wondering if you could triangulate what the other factors were to maybe what\u2019s in your guidance for iPods going forward and what\u2019s in your guidance for cannibalization of the iPhone to the iPod? That\u2019s my final question. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, for iPods in terms of assessing seasonality, we\u2019ve learned in the last years that really what drives the MP3 market to different levels are innovative product launches and the seasonal holiday buying in the December quarter, so we would expect to see a sequential decline in iPod sales from the December to March quarters but look, we\u2019re shipping the best iPods that we\u2019ve ever made. We\u2019ve launched the iPod Touch and we think it\u2019s been a great success. \nBen Reitzes - UBS: And those special things that other factors that impacted the iPod in the U.S., do you want to elaborate on what those were and whether they can continue?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I\u2019m not clearly on what you are asking. \nBen Reitzes - UBS: Tim mentioned that there was -- iPods were flat in the U.S. and that was perhaps due to the iPhone, but you don\u2019t know. There may be other factors. I was wondering if there were any of the other factors you wanted to elaborate on -- maybe there were shortages, maybe there was demand issue. I was just wondering what that was. \nTimothy D. Cook: Let me back up for a moment and talk about the iPod results in December and how we look at that internally. We set out to achieve three things in the December quarter with the iPod business. The first was we wanted to hold our already high share that we enjoy in the United States. We wanted to continue to grow share internationally and as we\u2019ve already said on the call, we are very pleased to report that we did both of those. In fact, some of the share gains are stunning when you look at the share gains in the U.K., France, Spain, Australia, and several other countries in Asia.  The second thing we wanted to do was to sell at least the number of iPod units that were comprehended in our guidance and we are pleased to report that the sales of over 22 million iPods not only set a company record but were also consistent with what we had contemplated in our guidance.  And the third thing, and most importantly by far from our point of view, as Peter talked about earlier we wanted to establish an entirely new type of iPod, the iPod Touch. The iPod Touch has the potential grow the iPod from being just a music and video player into being the very first mainstream WiFi mobile platform running all kinds of mobile applications, and we overwhelmingly met this goal. Introducing the Touch at the high end of the line may have traded off a bit of unit volume but it was the right decision to achieve the strategic goal of establishing a platform.  It\u2019s interesting to note that in achieving all three of these, we grew iPod revenue 17% year over year and this growth rate is the highest growth rate that we\u2019ve seen in revenue in iPod for a year. \nBen Reitzes - UBS: Thanks a lot. \nTimothy D. Cook: So that\u2019s kind of how we -- \nBen Reitzes - UBS: I got you. The Touch sacrificed a little unit growth but you are happy overall with your execution. \nTimothy D. Cook: We\u2019re thrilled with it. \nBen Reitzes - UBS: Okay. Thank you very much. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Good afternoon. Could we first get an update on Mac channels, Best Buy, what you are thinking in terms of distribution?\nTimothy D. Cook: We ended the quarter with about 286 stores in Best Buy. We are thrilled with the results that we\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s added to the Mac momentum. We have elected to expand that further and have jointly agreed with Best Buy that we\u2019ll expand from the 286 to 600 over the next six months, so we\u2019re very, very happy with how that relationship is coming out. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and I don\u2019t know, Tim or Peter, could you give us an idea on your goals for iTunes rentals? How should we think about the success of that business and is it more a way to drive incremental Apple TV sales or are you looking at it more from a profitability standpoint for that specific unit?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We just introduced it. We think customers are really going to love it but we\u2019ll have to see. Our objective with the iTunes store is to run it just a little above break even and we think that it helps us to sell iPods and Macs and that is really our strategy. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, and then sort of shifting over to MacBook Air, I don\u2019t know, Tim, if you could give anymore ideas as to how we should think about this fitting from a longer term standpoint into your product roadmap -- how do you think about the ultra mobile market? Is this more of a niche product? Should we think technology trickles down over time? Just anymore clarity you can give us, because obviously it could be fairly instrumental in terms of driving revenue. \nTimothy D. Cook: We create products that we hope will appeal to all types of people and we think that the MacBook Air will appeal to travelers, to professors, to all different kinds of people who want to access the computer very quickly wherever they are. We think it\u2019s very leading edge, it\u2019s a superior combination of size, weight and performance and form factor, while being very, very competitively priced if you look at what other people are charging for these, and so we think it\u2019s a great segment for us and a great new product. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, well hopefully -- we ordered a couple so hopefully it will come soon. \nTimothy D. Cook: The orders are very strong and so I hope you have a good place in the queue. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: I ordered it quickly. So one last question for Peter just to confirm, because I think it\u2019s pretty obvious but I want to make sure -- the 190 you talk about in OI&E, which is down sequentially even though cash is up, is that just reflecting rate reduction?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, great. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Thanks. I have two, if I could; Peter, is there any help you can give us on Leopard in the March quarter in terms of expectations and perhaps a way to frame it as how did Tiger do on the first quarter run-off, and give us some comparison for how Leopard framed up in December compared to Tiger? That\u2019s my first question. Thank you. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. As I indicated in my prepared remarks, Leopard is off to a great start. Customer and reviewer response has just been off the chart and about 19% as of the end of the quarter of the Mac OS 10 installed base is already enjoying Leopard.  Our sales going back to Tiger in its first quarter were $100 million, or about $100 million and in its second quarter were about $35 million. And as I indicated in the prepared remarks, Leopard sales in its first quarter were 170. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Right, so I got that part, Peter, but would you expect a similar trajectory over the course of the March quarter? And also, the 19%, where do you think that goes?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, we\u2019ll have to see. We are again, as I said, we\u2019re very excited about Leopard. Customer response has been strong. Sales will be down sequentially in the March quarter and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to follow the same trend that Tiger did. Your sales in the first quarter for consumer software titles are always the best but Tiger is doing incredibly well and the installed base is bigger today than what it was when we first shipped Tiger. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay, and then let me ask one -- \nPeter Oppenheimer: One other thing, if I can -- of course we are talking about largely finished goods sales in the box, but of course we\u2019re shipping Leopard on every Mac and I think that\u2019s contributing to the great Mac sales that we\u2019re enjoying. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay, fair enough. Tim, Japan had a little bit of a bounce back, actually a nice bounce back. Was that easy compares or was leading the charge in Japan?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, I am personally extremely happy with what happened in Japan last quarter. As you know, we have struggled there for several quarters and one data point doesn\u2019t make a trend but what happened was that the reception to iMac has been tremendous, our desktop chair moved from 6% to 10% year over year. Also, the reaction to iPod Touch was overwhelming, which really helped the iPod business have a much stronger revenue growth rate year over year, and so those two things together really drove Japan\u2019s performance. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Fair enough. All right, I will cede the floor. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thank you, Keith. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That comes from Charles Wolf with Needham & Company.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Thanks for taking the call. I had a couple of questions. One is on the revenue sharing arrangement that Apple has with the carriers. I noticed that Orange in France is selling the iPhone for EUR399 with a two-year subscription, but it\u2019s selling it for EUR749 unlocked. My question is does Apple share in the incremental revenues that Orange gets on an unlocked phone?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Charlie, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re not discussing the terms of our agreements with the carriers so I can\u2019t specifically answer that. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Okay, the second question is what was the -- I think you can answer this one, the division between direct and indirect sales worldwide?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Direct sales in the quarter for Q1 was 46% and that compared to 44% in the year-ago quarter. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Okay. Thanks a lot. \nNancy Paxton : Thank you, Charlie. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon. Peter, I realize you\u2019re not an economist, you mentioned earlier in the call, but I think there\u2019s a lot of conversations going around about the overall health of the consumer, specifically the high-end consumer. And when you hear these conversations, how should investors put into perspective that theme relative to Apple's business in 2008?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, as I said before, we\u2019ll leave the economic forecasting to others and we are just focusing on managing our business. You know, if the December quarter was any indication, we did incredibly well. Revenue growth here in the United States was 27%. Outside the United States, we were up 46%. The retail stores just had a record quarter. Traffic was up more than 10 million people year over year in the December quarter, if that\u2019s any indication.  So we think that we are managing our business very well. We are very confident in our strategy and our products and we\u2019ll just going to keep coming out with new, innovative hardware and software products that delight our customers and we want to keep growing the company. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: And in terms of the iPhone rollout internationally, do you want to just remind me what the -- is it Asia end of this year or some time in 2008 or what had we set on that?\nTimothy D. Cook: We still plan to enter Asia in 2008 and we also plan to roll out additional European countries during 2008.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Would Asia -- obviously Japan would be Asia. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about China -- anything specific relative to the China market?\nTimothy D. Cook: Nothing specific to announce today. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, and then lastly, Apple TV, you guys have referred to that as kind of a hobby in the past. What was it going to take for that to become more of an actual business that can move the needle?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, as Steve covered at MacWorld, many companies have tried in this space and missed. We are back with Apple TV take two with movie rentals directly from iTunes and we think we have it right this time, so we\u2019ll see. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: So basically don\u2019t think of it as a big impact in 2008 but maybe beyond, or -- \nTimothy D. Cook: You know, I\u2019m not projecting volumes on it but I think we have a great product. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Great. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thank you, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.\nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: I wanted to clarify something -- when you talked about the U.S. iPods being flat, you\u2019re talking year over year? I just want to clarify that in the question. \nTimothy D. Cook: Unit sales year over year were flat in the U.S., yes. \nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: And then I just want to again tie into the response to the last question, just in terms of as -- you know, with all this traffic coming in, can you give a sense about what you were seeing in terms of consumer behavior in terms of proclivity to spend, issues like that, that give you a sense about what the consumer is doing, what they are thinking?\nPeter Oppenheimer: In the December quarter, Andy, the retail stores just had a quarter for the record books. Our Mac sales were 504,000 in the stores. That was up 64% year over year and over half the Macs we were selling, we sold were to people that had never owned a Mac before, so that trend makes us feel very good. \nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: And lastly, could you give us a sense about store opening plans for this year, what you see in domestic and international split?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We expect to open about 35 to 40 stores in fiscal 2008. Today, about 25 of our 204 stores are outside the United States and we\u2019ll open more stores internationally in 2008 than we did in 2007, including our first stores in China. \nAndrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thank you, Andy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And that comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you and good afternoon. I have a couple of questions, please. Firstly, I wanted to explore more your comments on the different curve that you saw in demand in the U.S. in the last month of the quarter. Was that a statement that was only applicable to iPods or did the linearity curve in the U.S. regarding the Mac business look any different than it did last year?\nTimothy D. Cook: Mac was very strong throughout the quarter. The statement that I made was about iPod and it wasn\u2019t a statement that it wasn\u2019t strong -- it was a statement that when you got into the gift-buying season, the shape of the curve was somewhat different at the U.S. level, but at the worldwide level it was very, very similar to the previous year. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then, can you offer your perspective on what you saw outside your stores? Quick math would say your stores are growing at 50%. The U.S. business grew at 22%. Some rough math might suggest that non-Apple channels only grew in the single digits in the U.S. Can you comment on that? And again, maybe you can -- the Macs are a unique destination, I think, but if we look more broadly in your retail channel, can you comment on what you were seeing in those channels relative to other quarters and also the linearity over the course of the quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: Toni, I think there may be some confusion in the numbers. Let me go through these quickly -- Americas with retail grew 29%. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: How about U.S.?\nTimothy D. Cook: But when you strip out retail from that totally, and I\u2019m talking about our retail stores, Americas grew at 22%. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: What did the U.S. grow?\nTimothy D. Cook: The U.S. grew at 27% year over year. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, and if you strip out retail, what did the U.S. grow at?\nTimothy D. Cook: I don\u2019t have that number with me and it\u2019s not a number that we\u2019d report. But you can look at the Americas number and the U.S. is obviously the overwhelming majority of the Americas number. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Well, the observation is that if the U.S. grew at 27%, your stores grew at 50%, and the stores are 30% or 40% of your business in the U.S., then in order to true-up to the 27, you are coming up with a growth rate that is substantially below 27, probably about 10, doing the math in my head real time for the other channels. So I\u2019m just trying to understand what you saw in those other channels and if there was anything that you observed around linearity in the quarter. \nTimothy D. Cook: You can see from the data sheet that the Macs grew in the Americas channel at 35% year over year, Macs grew in the retail channel at 64% year over year. And so that was obviously a part of it. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, can you comment on the number of unlocked phones that you believe were sold in the quarter? You had mentioned that on your last call. \nTimothy D. Cook: We believe that the number of phones bought with the intention of unlocking was significant in the quarter but we are unsure how to reliably estimate the number. In the December quarter particularly, we saw sales increase across the quarter similar to what you would expect with the holiday gift-buying pattern.  But as we\u2019re new in the business, we\u2019re unsure when all the recipients will activate. Some people wait until their existing contracts expire, some may initially use the non-phone features only, others activate in the future, and so at this point we don\u2019t have a precise estimate for you.  We see this phenomenon as being an expression of very strong interest in iPhone globally and in that way, it\u2019s a good problem to have. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Can you comment qualitatively -- you\u2019ve given the number last quarter -- qualitatively, do you believe the percentage would actually be higher or lower this quarter, or is it too early to tell based on your experience?\nTimothy D. Cook: It\u2019s too early to tell. I would just say I think it is significant. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Okay, and then final question; I think you had mentioned initially at the end of the first quarter of iPhone sales that you didn\u2019t want to talk about iPhone channel inventory, that it was still a relatively small and insignificant product. Given that it has over $1 billion in deferred revenue, why are you choosing not to disclose that number?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Toni, that\u2019s not the reason we gave. We said that since we only have one channel partner in each of our first four countries, we\u2019re not going to report the inventory but we are going to employ our proven systems and processes to manage the iPhone differently, or effectively.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: It will come from Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Yes, thanks very much. Could you help reconcile the 2.3 million iPhones shipped in December versus over the 4 million announced at MacWorld?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. As Steve indicated at MacWorld, the 4 million iPhones were to date as of the keynote and the 3.7 million iPhones that we had sold cumulatively through the December quarter were part of that. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: So would you say that suggests a fairly significant increase in run-rate since December?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I\u2019ll leave the analysis to you but we\u2019re very happy with iPhone momentum. Our customers are raving about their iPhones and we remain confident in our goal for 10 million for calendar 2008. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Could you give us any, either quantitative or qualitative, commentary on how European iPhone uptake is faring versus your U.S. experience?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, we just launched in France at the end of November. We launched in the U.K. and Germany in November and earlier November, and so we had very limited experience but we are very happy with all of the launches so far. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Is 3G and Bluetooth important to that 10 million iPhone outlook, as well as to your plans for the European market?\nTimothy D. Cook: We don\u2019t talk about new products but we are very confident in meeting the 10 million for the year of 2008. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Based on the roadmap that you have?\nTimothy D. Cook: We\u2019ve very confident in meeting the 10 million for 2008. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, do you have any plans to talk about next regions or countries at all?\nTimothy D. Cook: We have nothing to announce today. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: It comes from Tavis McCourt with Morgan Keegan. \nTavis McCourt - Morgan Keegan: Thanks for taking my question. The last couple of quarters, you guys have mentioned in relation to the guidance for gross margin, the expectation of component costs creeping back up. You didn\u2019t mention that this quarter. Should we take that to believe your guidance presumes a roughly flat component cost environment?\nTimothy D. Cook: For the current quarter, our expectation is on DRAM and NAND Flash memories, we believe both of these markets will remain in an oversupply condition. We see LCD, hard drives, and optical markets being close to a supply/demand balance, which should result in some improvement in costs from last quarter. And for most of the other components, we see the seasonally slower March quarter resulting in historic level price declines. \nTavis McCourt - Morgan Keegan: And then in terms of the iPhone seasonality, historically the wireless phone business is somewhat seasonal in Q1 coming off a typically strong Q4. Should we be building in an expectation of sequentially down shipments or is that something you just don\u2019t want to get into at this point? \nPeter Oppenheimer: As you know, we\u2019ve recently begun to sell iPhones and we don\u2019t have any experience yet with the March quarter handset seasonality so I can\u2019t comment on it. \nTavis McCourt - Morgan Keegan: Okay, thanks a lot. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks, Tavis. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Shaw Wu with American Technology.\nShaw Wu - American Technology Research: Thanks. I just had a question, a little more color on your Mac business. I think, Tim, you kind of answered it a little bit but I noticed that our desktop business was a bit stronger than your portable business, at least on a sequential basis and even on a year-over-year basis. Any color there in terms of why that happened?\nTimothy D. Cook: Shaw, the iMac announcement in August was extremely well-received and the iMac had enormous momentum. In fact, if you look at desktops, the iMac grew faster than notes but the total of our desktops grew at 53% and that compares to an IDC projected growth rate of the desktop market of only 10%, so over five times the market rate of growth. \nShaw Wu - American Technology Research: Okay, and then Peter, I am going to try to take another stab at this iPhone seasonality question. Your guidance implies obviously seasonality for the whole company and you commented on the iPod. I understand it\u2019s a little early but just a little help in terms of what should we think of iPhone seasonality at this point? Or is it just too early? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Shaw, this is not something that I can comment for you on this quarter. We have not yet been through a March quarter with iPhone so we don\u2019t have any history go by as we do with Mac and iPod, so we\u2019ll report to you in April what we did for the March quarter. \nShaw Wu - American Technology Research: Okay. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton : Thank you, Shaw. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And that will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Thanks. I wanted to ask about Mac distribution points in the quarter. How many retail outlets or distribution points was the Mac available during the quarter and do you have any targets for year-end?\nTimothy D. Cook: We have moved the number of storefronts carrying Mac now up to 9,500 and that compares to 7,700 a year ago. We have done that because of the momentum that we see in the Macintosh business. \nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Do you have a target?\nTimothy D. Cook: The only target I am talking about right now is we plan on doubling the number of Best Buy stores, as I talked about earlier in the conference call. \nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: How about for iPhone distribution points? How many retail outlets are available within existing countries where the phone is available? And then do you have a target for iPhone distribution points -- and I\u2019m thinking here specifically around the consumer electronics channel or an expansion of the Best Buy relationship? Thanks. \nTimothy D. Cook: We have about 2,500 storefronts in Europe that carry iPhone between the U.K., France, and Germany, and we have around 2,000, 2,100 or so in the United States between our stores and the AT&T stores.  In terms of expansion, I don\u2019t have anything to announce today in terms of an expansion. \nNancy Paxton : Thank you, Chris. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And that comes from Andy Hargreaves with Pacific Crest Securities.\nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities: I\u2019m just wondering on Apple TV if you have any plans to do any new in-store displays or any other marketing to show what the product does, especially at third-party retailers?\nTimothy D. Cook: This is something that we are looking at but have nothing specific to talk about today. \nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, and then also just wondering if there\u2019s anything you guys are doing actively to try to promote more corporate use outside of the traditional customers in either your reseller channel or in education that you are doing, training, that kind of thing?\nTimothy D. Cook: The education market had a record Q1 for us. We grew about five times the IDC\u2019s forecasted market rate of growth of 6%, and this was led by both K-12 and higher ed, and so we were doing excellent in this business.  There are many, many examples of small business using Mac and larger businesses continue to be interested in the Macintosh as well. \nNancy Paxton : Thanks very much, Andy and thanks to everyone.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Madam.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer and he\u2019ll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts. Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2008, the Forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased to report Apple\u2019s most profitable quarter ever, and sales of more Macs and iPhones than in any previous quarter. We are thrilled with these record-breaking results, particularly given the economic environment around us. Revenue for the quarter was $9.87 billion, representing 25% growth over the prior September quarter\u2019s results. This was Apple's second-highest quarterly revenue ever, next to the record results reported for the last September quarter. Operating margin was Apple's highest ever at $2.19 billion, representing over 22% of revenue and higher than our guidance due to better-than-expected revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.67 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.82. In terms of non-GAAP measures, adjusted sales totaled $12.25 billion for the September quarter, which was almost $2.4 billion higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was $5.21 billion, which was almost $1.6 billion higher than our reported gross margin. And adjusted net income was $2.85 billion, or almost $1.2 billion higher than our reported net income. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis and understanding of our performance in the September quarter. Turning to the details of our results, I\u2019d like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated outstanding Mac sales of 3.05 million, beating our previous record set in the year-ago quarter by over 440,000. The Mac is showing fantastic momentum, growing faster than the market in 19 of the past 20 quarters. We believe this is the result of our unmatched innovation and commitment to providing customers with the best hardware, the best software, and the best user experience in the world. Quarterly Mac sales grew 17% year over year and this compares extremely favorably to IDC\u2019s latest published estimate of 2% growth for the market overall in the September quarter. Customers continue to respond very positively to our Mac portable lineup which we updated in June. Portable sales increased 35% year over year and represented 74% of our Mac mix. Our execution in the quarter was outstanding and we were particularly pleased with the 42% year over year growth in our Asia-Pacific segment. We once again had a very successful back-to-school season and we are very pleased with a 12% year-over-year increase in Mac sales to U.S. education institutions, which resulted in the highest quarterly Mac sales ever for our U.S. education business. The shipments to U.S. education institutions this quarter included 50,000 Macbooks to the State of Maine as part of its ongoing one-to-one initiative. Customer response to the August 28th release of Snow Leopard has been tremendous. Through the end of the September quarter, we generated consumer box upgrade sales at twice the rate we experienced with the Leopard release. Snow Leopard delivers hundreds of refinements, is the only operating system to support Exchange out-of-the-box, and has successfully introduced new core technologies. Snow Leopard allows developers to take full advantage of hardware features, including 64-bit technologies, multi-core processors, and advanced graphics processing units. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. Now I\u2019ll turn to our music products. We sold almost 10.2 million iPods, which was down from just over 11 million in the year-ago quarter. Our latest research indicates that 50% of recent iPod buyers were purchasing their first iPod, including those in our high market share countries such as the U.S., Japan, Australia, Canada, and the U.K. Customers love the recently announced iPod Nano\u2019s new features, including the built-in videocamera, FM radio, pedometer, and larger display. Sales of iPod Touch grew strongly during the quarter, up 100% year over year, fueled by a very successful back-to-school season and the continued incredible popularity of the Apps store. With the new $199 entry price point for the iPod Touch and the updated features of the iPod Shuffle, Nano, and Classic, we believe the iPod\u2019s lineup is attractively positioned for the holiday season. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD, and iPod was the top-selling MP3 player and continued to gain share year over year in nearly every country we track, based on the latest data published by GFK. We began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes store delivered another great quarter with strong sales of music, video, and apps. Customers are loving last month\u2019s release of iTunes 9 and its many new features, including iTunes LT, home-sharing, and genius mixes, as well as improved thinking and the redesigned iTunes store. With stores in 23 countries, iTunes is the world\u2019s largest music retailer, now offering over 11 million songs in addition to over 50,000 TV episodes and 7,500 films. I would now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold almost 7.4 million handsets in the September quarter. That\u2019s a new company record and an increase of 7% over the prior September quarter when we increased channel inventory by 2 million handsets following the introduction of the iPhone 3G and the dramatic expansion of geographic distribution. iPhone sell-through in the quarter increased 38% year over year. Response to the new iPhone 3GS has continued to be tremendous and we were very pleased with JD Power & Associates\u2019 announcement earlier this month that iPhone has once again topped the charts for both consumer and business smartphone customer satisfaction. iPhone not only maintained its lead since the last JD Power report was issued six months ago, but it widened it over the next closest competitor in both categories. We are looking forward to selling iPhones in China beginning later this month as this very large market represents a great opportunity to expand iPhone's reach even more broadly. We also plan to expand our carrier relationships in the U.K. and Canada. The Apps store continues to be an unparalleled success, with over 85,000 apps available and over 2 billion customer downloads to date, including over half a billion downloads in the September quarter. In addition to adding more apps at an amazing pace, we have continue to enhance the Apps Store experience with iPhone OS 3.1 which includes new features such as genius recommendations and a streamlined way to organize apps within iTunes. Recognized revenue from the iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $2.3 billion during the quarter compared to $806 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 185%. The sales value of iPhones sold during the quarter was $4.5 billion. I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. The stores had a record quarter posting the highest revenue, segment margin and Mac sales ever. Revenue in the quarter was $1.87 billion compared to $1.72 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our stores sold 670,000 Macs compared to 596,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened 15 new stores during the quarter, bringing us to a total of 273. With an average of 262 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $7.1 million compared to $7.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin was $410 million or 22%, up from $301 million or 17.5% in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 45.9 million visitors in our stores during the quarter, compared to 42.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 7%. We hosted 608,000 personal training sessions and we sold 208,000 memberships to our One-to-One program, an increase of over 120% year-over-year. Fiscal 2009 was a milestone year for our retail stores. In addition to opening 26 new stores we remodeled 72 stores to our updated design and for the first time we opened more stores internationally than in the United States. In November we plan to open our first new stores in France, including one at the Louvre as well as our fourth high-profile store in Manhattan on the Upper West Side. Total company gross margin was 36.6% which was 260 basis points better than our guidance. There were two groups of factors that were the primary causes of this difference: First, we sold more Snow Leopards, had a better product mix and spent less on the iPod transition than planned. Second, component costs did increase, but not to the level we had expected and we benefited from leverage on the higher revenue and lower freight and other costs than planned. Operating expenses were $1.42 billion and included $151 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $45 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $34 billion at the end of the September quarter compared to $31.1 billion at the end of the June quarter, an increase of $2.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was $3.1 billion and that was net of our $500 million prepayment to Toshiba early in the September quarter to secure a future supply of NAND flash. Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio. Looking ahead to the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. On September 23, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified EITF 093, which will change the way we account for iPhones and Apple TV today. Under EITF 093, only the estimated sales value of future upgrade rights to iPhones and Apple TV software are required to be deferred at the time of sale, with the balance of the iPhones and Apple TV sales price being recognized immediately as revenue. The deferred amount will be recognized over the 24 months estimated life of the product, similar to the way we have applied subscription accounting to these product sales today. We don\u2019t know at this time the specific amount of revenue deferral for each iPhone and Apple TV sold under EITF 093, but we do believe that a substantial portion of the revenues will be recognized for these products at the time of sale. We are very pleased with the FASB adoption of this new rule, as we believe it will enable us to more closely align our reported results with the economics of the iPhone and Apple TV sales. We will be required to adopt the new accounting rules no later than the first quarter of our fiscal 2011; a year from now. But we do have the option of adopting earlier than that, sometime in our fiscal 2010. We are currently assessing the impact of the new rule on our accounting and reporting systems and processes. Making this change will be complex and as of now, we are uncertain as to the timing of our adoption; therefore, we don't have anything more specific to discuss with you today about this change. The guidance for the December quarter that we are providing today is based on a subscription accounting treatment that we have applied today for the iPhone and Apple TV sales. In other words, it is based on the assumption that the full amounts of revenue and product costs of past and future iPhone and Apple TV sales continue to be recognized ratably over the estimated 24-month life of the product. Forecasts in the current economic macro environment remains challenging but we will continue to provide a range of guidance for the December quarter. For the December quarter, we expect the revenues to be between about $11.3 billion and $11.6 billion. We expect gross margin to be about 34%, reflecting approximately $33 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $1.64 billion, including about $178 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $30 million, reflective of the short-term interest rate environment, and we expect the tax rate to be about 30%. We are targeting EPS in the range of about $1.70 to $1.78. In closing, we are thrilled with our outstanding September quarter results and with our record fiscal 2009. For the year, we generated $36.5 billion in revenue and $5.7 billion in net income. That is 12% annual revenue growth and 18% net income growth in extraordinarily challenging economic times. During the year, we continued to introduce incredibly innovative products, including the new aluminum unibody MacBook Pro, the iPhone 3GS, and the iPhone OS 3.0, Mac OS10 Snow Leopard, and of course, the wildly popular new features and offerings in iTunes and the Apps Store. As we begin our fiscal 2010 we are looking forward to delivering additional exciting new products and are confident in our new product pipeline. We remain focused on our strategy of bringing the best and most innovative products and solutions to our customers and we are very enthusiastic about the year ahead. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: Peter, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the factors in forming your guidance for the following quarter. Specifically, why the sequential jump in revenue is so far below what you have experienced for the last couple of years and also why gross margins should be down as much as you've got it sequentially, the main factors there?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Let me start with gross margin and I will come back to revenue. We expect gross margins to decline sequentially about 34%, primarily as a result of four factors: First, for the new products that we have and will announce, we are delivering greater value to our customers and these products have lower gross margins than their predecessors. Second and as expected, we will see a seasonally higher mix of iPods and expect Snow Leopard box sales to be less than the second quarter. Third, we will incur significantly more air freight. And fourth, we expect component costs to be higher than what we saw in the September quarter. Regarding our revenue, as you know, the education and back-to-school seasons have largely concluded and the December quarter has been typically driven by holiday purchases in the second half of the quarter. Our guidance this quarter includes double-digit revenue growth from last year, which was the best quarter from a revenue perspective in Apple's history. We are also seeing lower ASPs this year. But Rich, we remain very confident in our business. We are shipping the best products that we ever have in Apple\u2019s history and customers have clearly responded.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital.\nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: I have two questions. One on iPhone, can you discuss channel inventory, what it was ending the quarter and what the supply situation is, if there are any supply constraints during the quarter? We noticed lack of availability overseas and then that looked alleviated towards the end of the quarter. It would seem like there is pent up demand heading in to December, so if you could discuss that, that would be great.\nTimothy D. Cook: For much of the quarter most of the countries where we are selling the iPhone 3GS was very low in inventory, as demand outstripped the supply. We did improve supply markedly in September and supply and demand converged in the vast majority of countries either in September or in early October. In terms of your channel inventory question, we now have about 2.4 million units in the channel and that\u2019s an additional 585,000 from the previous quarter end.\nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Are you comfortable with that, given that you have China launching and maybe even a few other geos?\nTimothy D. Cook: I would have liked to have had more, honestly, because we were still short in some countries at quarter end. As I indicated, it was early October before we were able to get supply and demand balanced in some countries.\nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: I know you don\u2019t want to quantify China, maybe, but is there any certain level of excitement you have or any limitations in terms of apps and iTunes that may limit the sales out of the gate or anything else you could say qualitatively around that launch that would give us an idea of the velocity of units?\nTimothy D. Cook: We\u2019re thrilled to be launching there on October 30th with China Unicom and we\u2019re going to start with about 1,000 points of sale and then expand further over the next several months thereafter. They\u2019ve announced the plans and prices that they\u2019ll have for the device and for the service. There\u2019s a very wide range here on the post-paid side from $18 a month all the way up to $85, $100 a month. At the higher price point an individual is able to actually get the device for free and it goes up as you go down the ARPU, as it would in most countries. As you know, as we\u2019ve shipped the 3G and the 2G phone prior to that, we discovered that there were quite a few phones going in to China so it would seem to us to indicate that there\u2019s a good opportunity and we\u2019re really excited to get started. We\u2019re not making any projections on the volume but it is a huge market, the largest market in the world in terms of total phones and I think it\u2019s very important that we get started to make it as large as possible on Smartphones.\nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Do you guys have any updated comments on the economy? That\u2019s my last question. It seemed like the quarter must have closed very strong, especially with those Mac numbers.\nTimothy D. Cook: We just spend our time projecting our business and leave the economy forecasting and comments to the economists.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: We\u2019re looking at the iPhone, it\u2019s pretty clear we\u2019re still in a greenfield opportunity here, but if you start to go to multiple carriers can you talk a little bit about the pricing of the phone when you go from exclusivity to multiple carriers? And obviously, not specific but any sort of color we can have in terms of pricing dynamics change on the phone from you to the carrier?\nTimothy D. Cook: Our pricing is confidential, Gene, so it\u2019s not something I could comment on in detail but generally speaking from markets where we\u2019re already selling I would not expect to see a wholesale price difference as we bring on other carriers. However, the end user price is really set by the carriers themselves so you may or may not see a street price difference.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: So when you go from exclusive to multiple carriers, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily see change in pricing that you are charging the carrier? Is that correct?\nTimothy D. Cook: That\u2019s correct.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Scott Price from Banc of America.\nScott Price - Banc of America: Tim, I know you guys don\u2019t have a lot of experience with the seasonality of the iPhone business, but how do you think about the seasonality here into the fourth quarter? And a question for Peter on tax. Can you walk us through why the tax rate is going to go up here in the near-term? Thanks.\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, as you said, when we looked at the September to December quarter, we have very few September to Decembers to look at in the iPhone business since we\u2019ve just been selling for a couple of years and in fact in the vast majority of countries, we\u2019ve only been selling [in one], and some of those just a partial; and so honestly speaking, we are new in the business still and I think for me to make any kind of seasonality forecast would not be a good idea. The things that we look at in terms of coming up with our forecasts would be the popularity of the iPhone 3GS has been phenomenal; we were very surprised by the demand. We were selling in 64 countries by the end of the quarter. We\u2019ll roll out to some others this quarter, notably China, which has already been mentioned in the call. We hope to roll out in Korea as well and as Gene mentioned previously, we will be adding some carriers in some countries where we only had one carrier before, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, as an example. So those are the things that we think about as we think about our December forecast.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Scott, related to your tax question, our tax rate for the quarter was 26% and it was below our guidance of 30%, primarily due to a higher mix of foreign earnings. But for the year, we were about 29%. The past two years we\u2019ve been pretty much right on 30% so from what I see at this point for fiscal \u201810, we\u2019ll see about 30% for our tax rate, really consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Scott. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From RBC Capital Markets we will hear from Mike Abramsky.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. Tim, what are your thoughts in the holiday season, given the increase in competitive intensity against iPhone? There\u2019s a lot of obviously wannabes that are coming to market in the season, particularly Android and many of them are offering touch screens and richer browsing and media and app stores and are being given carrier support. How do you think about maintaining your momentum and differentiation amidst that kind of environment?\nTimothy D. Cook: Well, Mike, we feel great about how we ended the fiscal year with selling 7.4 million, as Peter talked about in the preamble. And that put us over 20 million -- almost 21 million for the fiscal year, which was up 78% from before. And so we have significant momentum. Also when you look at the ecosystem that we\u2019ve got with iTunes and the Apps store with the Apps store having over 85,000 apps, which is a country mile more than anyone else, plus the very strong product pipeline that we have, we feel very, very good about sitting up and competing against anyone. Frankly I think that people are really just trying to catch up with the first iPhone that was announced two years ago and we\u2019ve long since moved beyond that.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Were you pleasantly surprised at the mix of 3GS versus 99, and what did that tell you perhaps about the value proposition of Apple and how that drives iPhone going forward?\nTimothy D. Cook: As I indicated before, the demand for the 3GS did exceed our expectation and we quickly changed our orders for components, et cetera, that are different between the models. I think it shows that there\u2019s an intense appetite for Apple's latest technology and we were very pleased with the result.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We will hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Hi, thank you. Can you talk a bit about the Mac business? The channel inventory levels, what the mix has been, now that you have had a few months since the refresh of your line-up?\nTimothy D. Cook: Sure, Shannon. This is Tim. Last quarter was the quarter of the portable, up 35% year over year compared to IDC at 9% and so we really had a blow out quarter for portables. It is the result of the line-up that we announced in June and as you know we had backlog in the quarter on that line. Also the Mac itself via back-to-school which was the strongest back-to-school we had ever had, as Peter talked about, and the launch of Snow Leopard which occurred later in the quarter. So there was a group of things that came together to push us to a level above $3 million which was above our own expectations internally, or even some of our stretch targets. From a channel inventory point of view, we started the quarter between three and four weeks, we ended the quarter between three and four weeks and to be specific on the inventory change, so there is no misunderstanding, the inventory changed less than 15,000 units from beginning to end, so we had very minor growth, particularly when you compare that to the growth in sales from a sequential point of view.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Great. Any idea of the penetration of Snow Leopard right now out in the installed base? I think Peter mentioned fewer shipments of box sales in the coming quarter, but any idea as to where you are at?\nTimothy D. Cook: The upgrade sales of Snow Leopard, which we include the family in the box set, were more than double what we experienced for Leopard over the same five-week initial sales period, so this doubling was much more than we had planned and were very pleasantly surprised by it.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Great. I guess the price cut worked. Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, it did. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Credit Suisse we will hear from Bill Shope.\nBill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse: Great, thanks guys. Last year you provided some commentary around longer-term gross margin trends. Do you have any thoughts on this for Fiscal 2010, or at least how we should think about this longer term?\nTimothy D. Cook: I can give you some qualitative thoughts. For the December quarter I have guided to about 34%. I don\u2019t want to make forecasts today for future quarters on a quantitative basis, but I think there are two things that you have to be aware of. First, for some key components costs are rising. I think that is visible to you. Second, we are continuing to focus on delivering state of the art products at price points our competitors can\u2019t match and we are going to continue to provide ever increasing value to our customers.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Bailey - Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: On the iPhone with the wholesale price for the iPhone the same whether you have an exclusive agreement or whether you have multiple carriers, what are the benefits of having exclusive agreements in some of those bigger countries?\nTimothy D. Cook: For Apple or for the carrier?\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: For Apple.\nTimothy D. Cook: In an exclusive relationship you can generally have some level of innovation that would be more difficult to do with several carriers. Digital voicemail was an example of that we had in the initial iPhone,as you recall. Also in some cases an exclusive carrier may be willing to invest more, lthough we found no lack of people wanting to sell iPhones,frankly. So I am not sure whether that is true on a broad basis or not. I think that may be true in some individual cases. Other than that, I would ask them because they can probably give you a better view than I could.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan.\nMark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan: Could you give us any sort of sense qualitatively in terms of what Apple has seen with respect to the impact of the remodeled stores as well as the increasing penetration of the Apple Retail stores internationally? Are you seeing any sort of synergies both with your direct or indirect sales levels because of these initiatives or is it still too early to be determined?\nPeter Oppenheimer : I will take that question. We are seeing strong results from our remodeled stores. Lon and his team have remodeled, as I said, this year 72 of the stores to bring them to our most updated design. Those designs are providing the best customer experience in the industry, bar none, whether it be upfront in the selling part of the store or certainly in the back of the store with the genius bars or the creative bars. Customers are having a great experience. In terms of international, the growth there was quite strong in the quarter. Our average store revenue was actually up over 20% for our international stores this quarter.\nMark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan: The other question revolves around the OpEx ratio going forward. You talked in your prepared remarks about 2010 and the new product pipeline. Can you give us a sense in terms of how investors should think about the R&D or SG&A moving up? Is that going to hold steady or will there be changes regarding that pipeline?\nPeter Oppenheimer : I don\u2019t want to give a specific, quantitative percent. I think over the last year we have managed operating expenses well but we have been investing confidently for our future especially in engineering, distribution and our marketing and advertising. We saw the benefit in the last downturn in 2001 and 2002 of coming out of that with just an amazingly strong pipeline and we are repeating that very positive lesson this time around. So I think we are being careful with money. We are making good choices but continuing to invest wisely and confidently in our future.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: You had very strong ASP performance in both Mac and iPhone. On the Mac side you are typically down because of the back-to-school promotion because of ASP. You were up even on the Notebook side this quarter. Can you comment on that? On the iPhone side it does look like your ASP went up $40 or $50 sequentially on a cash basis. You had stated last quarter that 3GS was outstripping the $99 phone so was it mix alone or was there something else around currency translation or something else that is affecting that?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Let me start with iPhone. The iPhone ASP in the quarter was just over $600 and this reflected both a high mix of the 3GS sell through and also the benefit of the rebalancing the ending channel inventory more towards the 3GS as a result of the introduction. On a sequential basis yes, our ASPs were up a bit in the portable space. This was really a function of our seeing a higher mix of our new Mac Book Pros as Tim commented. A very, very strong quarter after the June introduction. We had the best back-to-school season that we have ever had. On a sequential basis we also got a little benefit from the dollar as well. On a year-over-year basis the dollar was a negative but sequentially it was a small positive.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Then on the availability issues that you had on the phone, was that a good old fashion demand exceeds supply issue or were there any component availability issues that constrained your supply? Related to that you had also mentioned that air freight you expected to go up next quarter as a reason for gross margins, I\u2019m not sure if that was in relation to phones or anything else but perhaps you can address that as well?\nTimothy D. Cook: On the availability portion Toni, the iPhone 3GS demand outstripped the supply of the iPhone 3GS so I think you would probably put that in your first category of a good old fashioned demand issue which is a nice problem to have in the scheme of things. Now, because it was outstripping supply it creates component shortages as we go out to the market to secure more components. Generally speaking, the ones that are hardest to get are silicon and so it takes a little longer however, I was really happy that we were able to solve the bulk of these, the vast majority of them in September or in early October so I feel good about how we are positioned now. The air freight is not related to the iPhone so these are unrelated topics. But, generally speaking the air freight is planned to get enough units into the channel in time for the holidays and is necessary for that reason.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Now, I would imagine that you have that typically in most Q4s and accordingly is that larger than usual for this quarter because your demand perception may have changed over the last 30 or 60 days, or is that just a normal sequential seasonal headwind to margins that you always experience?\nPeter Oppenheimer: It\u2019s more than normal and so you\u2019re correct that in general we spend more in freight in Q1. However, this increase is larger than usual. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be specific on the product but it\u2019s an abnormal sequential increase.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Maynard Um \u2013 UBS.\nMaynard Um \u2013 UBS: Can you just talk about how many non-Apple retail store distribution points you have and whether there\u2019s more growth there? I\u2019m just trying to think about the mix of your retail stores versus your indirect going forward. Then, I have a follow up question on CapEx.\nTimothy D. Cook: Maynard is that specific to the Mac?\nMaynard Um \u2013 UBS: To the Mac, yes.\nTimothy D. Cook: For the Mac we have a little less than 13,000 worldwide and our focus in terms of expansion in the in direct channel is much more so in the international market. As you probably could tell from our results we grew the Mac much stronger outside the US than inside the US and I am sure part of that is just the economic difference between the two. But, the international business, particularly in Europe and in Asia was extremely strong last quarter.\nMaynard Um \u2013 UBS: Okay, and just in particular, Europe, was that broad-based or Western or Eastern? Any more specifics on Europe?\nTimothy D. Cook: I can give you some highlights. If you look at the leads, Spain was extremely strong, which I know is going to be a surprise. It was over 40%. Germany was 40%, France was 39%, and so you had Western Europe less the U.K. extremely strong, a tremendous multiple from market growth, and even countries, Switzerland and Italy, were in the mid-30s and so several European countries, sizable countries were incredibly strong.\nMaynard Um \u2013 UBS: Great, and then just on the CapEx, it was about 4.7% of your sales and I\u2019m just trying to understand, I know you have the new stores in there but aside from that, you talk about normal replacement of existing capital assets, manufacturing-related equipment. Any more details you can provide on that piece of the CapEx that is being spent on the capital assets? In particular, what that is and when that should start to decrease as a percentage of sales?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I\u2019m not sure I would look at it as a percent of sales but in fiscal 09, our CapEx was about $1.15 billion, up from about $1.1 billion last year. We spent a little under $400 million in both years on retail stores. As I look forward, we are going to continue to confidently open retail stores and keep them fresh and exciting from a remodel perspective. The other parts of our business, we are spending capital on the facilities, infrastructure, and in the manufacturing spaces as well. But in $1.1 billion in the last two years, we\u2019ve not been terribly capital intensive.\nMaynard Um \u2013 UBS: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Maynard. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Deutsche Bank, we\u2019ll hear from Chris Whitemore.\nChris Whitemore - Deutsche Bank: First on the Mac business, looking forward to the December quarter, do you expect to hold Mac units roughly flat sequentially?\nTimothy D. Cook: The things that we are considering -- we don\u2019t give Mac-specific forecasts, as you know, or product specific forecasts -- but the things I think you should consider that we considered, anyway, in coming up with our numbers, the September quarter was benefited by a 50,000 unit order from the State of Maine. This completed the 70,000 unit order. The other 20,000 had shipped in our fiscal Q3. It also benefited from an extremely strong back-to-school season and we had an extremely strong promotion wrapped around that, as you are aware. We also had Snow Leopard and with every new OS, you have some pent-up demand that ships with the operating systems as people hold to get the latest software. Finally, and I wouldn\u2019t underestimate this, the demand for the portables that we announced in June was a key for the quarter at 35% growth and some of that was demand that was probably existed in June but we were unable to fill. So it got the quarter off to a very good start. So those are the things that we thought about as we forecasted the Mac business.\nChris Whitemore - Deutsche Bank: Second question on iPhone supply. Can you quantify the magnitude of the unit shortfall? In other words, what do you think you could have shipped had you had adequate supply during the quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, that\u2019s a very tough question to answer because unfortunately we can't run the experiment both ways. What I know is that for almost the entire quarter, until we got into September, the iPhone 3GS was short virtually everywhere. What I don\u2019t know is how many people waited until it was available versus bought a competitive phone and there\u2019s just -- there is not a good way to tell that.\nChris Whitemore - Deutsche Bank: Still on track to reach 80 countries by year-end for iPhone shipments, iPhone availability?\nTimothy D. Cook: To be specific, we already shipped the iPhone 3G in over 80 today. We shipped the 3GS in 64 countries as of the end of last quarter and we would forecast that we would be in over 80 by the end of the calendar year with the 3GO.\nChris Whitemore - Deutsche Bank: The last question relates to guidance. Given the account change, in my opinion, GAAP accounting loses some meaning. Can you provide a range of pro forma expectations for December? I think that would be more meaningful to the investment community.\nTimothy D. Cook: I have provided you the guidance that we have provided. It's very detailed and consistent with when we began to ship the iPhone. We provide guidance on GAAP and we will report to you our numbers in January for the December quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Shaw Wu \u2013 Kaufman Brothers.\nShaw Wu \u2013 Kaufman Brothers: I have a question on I guess the enterprise business. Two questions. First, on your iPhone business, any color you can share with us, the break-out between consumer and enterprise? At least qualitatively and how that has been trending? And then the second question is one of the key features with Snow Leopard is native support for Exchange. Any comment on how that's helping your enterprise effort?\nTimothy D. Cook: In terms of the iPhone and the corporate market, what I can tell you is that employee demand for iPhone, in the corporate environment, is very strong. Since the launch of the iPhone 3GS, which coupled with the software, made a number of improvements that CIOs were looking for. The iPhone is either being deployed or being piloted in well over 50% of the Fortune 100 and from an international point of view, if you look at Europe, this is true in about 50% of the Financial Times 100. And so we feel very good with the progress that we've made since the iPhone 3GS was announced. Also, another very key market for us, that some people call enterprise, is that over 350 higher-ed institutions have approved iPhones for their faculty, staff, and students. And in addition to both of these, we continue to be very happy with our sales in the government arena. In terms of Snow Leopard and Exchange, I don't have any statistics to go over with you yet. It is very early. As you know, we just started shipping SP end of August, last quarter, and so we will see how that does. But it clearly makes it very simple for the Windows user with Exchange working right out of the box.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech: Nice quarter. I guess a question with regard to the enterprise as well. I think last quarter you may have commented, you know there are several government agencies out there that have kind of 30,000+ iPhone uses installed. I was wondering if we could get an update there on maybe some granular specifics of some of those.\nTimothy D. Cook: No new update on specific numbers but we continue to be very pleased with the market and the number of agencies that are adopting the iPhone.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech: And the same with regard to corporate entities as well?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, and I just went through that in the previous call, but to repeat it, well over 50% of the Fortune 100 are deploying or piloting the iPhone, and this strength is also happening internationally and if you take Europe, about 50% of the Financial Times 100 are deploying or actively evaluating iPhones for a broad deployment. These numbers are very impressive to us and we feel like we are making great progress in this market.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech: And Tim, I think that you commented in the past that three of that Fortune 100 had 25,000 units or greater. Any updates on there?\nTimothy D. Cook: None that we can provide. As you can probably guess, many of these companies would like to keep their specific numbers confidential.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech: Understood. And final question, any chance that the international activations grew on a year-over-year basis for the iPhone?\nTimothy D. Cook: Well, iPhone sell-through was up 38% year-over-year. You know, as Peter went through in the preamble last year, and I think it's very important to remember, we expanded channel inventory by about 2 million units because it was the launch of the iPhone 3G, during that quarter. We only grew inventory this particular year by less than 600,000 and so that sell through increase of 38% compares to a projected rate of market growth of 5% from analysis. So it is a significant multiple to market growth based on the market statistics that we have.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech: That 5%, just to clarify, is international?\nTimothy D. Cook: That 5% is a worldwide number.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: I have a question for you on the Macintosh side if I could to do a deeper dive on the education sector. A question for Tim, you have been pretty cautious regarding state spending here given the tax issues that you quoted for the different states. What powered the upside in education, specifically K12 and higher ed? Also if you could give additional color on what happened in the student buy versus your expectations as well given the popularity of Notebooks for students. Then I have one follow-up if I could.\nTimothy D. Cook: Let me start with the last one first. The student buy, you can see those numbers trickling through our retail results and you can\u2019t see this because we don\u2019t quite break it out separately but they significantly helped our online results and the institutions that buy through bookstores so that the back-to-school season again was our strongest ever and I would attribute a great piece of that to the individual business we were talking about. In terms of the institutional business, I have been worried about state spending. I am still worried about state spending. We saw no material stimulus funding slowing last quarter. We saw a little but it was a very small number. We may see more this quarter but it is too early to tell. In terms of the institutional increase, institutions grew about 12% and that increase was the big thing that pushed us over the zero mark there, the state of Maine order. It was extremely key in the education institution achievement.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: On Mac inventory, doing a deeper dive here on the air freight question, I know you won\u2019t talk about the products but what is driving the increase in air freight? Is it timing of new announcements? Are you having issues with component availability? Are you running into manufacturing yield issues? Why the uptick here?\nTimothy D. Cook: What is driving the air freight is we haven\u2019t been able to figure out a way to move the holiday season. We have to get all of these units into the channel for holiday sales. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be more specific than that. You have to have a little bit of fun on these calls.\nNancy Paxton: That concludes our Q&A session for today. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available for two weeks as podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on Apple.com/Investor and via telephone.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Madam. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer and he\u2019ll be joined by Apple COO Tim Cook and Treasurer Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts.  Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts.  For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2008, the Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2009, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.  And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the record June quarter revenue and earnings and to once again report the highest non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history.  It was an extremely busy quarter for new product introductions and customers have responded enthusiastically.  Revenue for the June quarter was $8.34 billion, representing 12% growth over the prior June quarter\u2019s results. We are very proud of this results, particularly given the economic environment around us.  Operating margin percentage for the quarter was over 20%, higher than our guidance due to better-than-expected revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.23 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.35. In terms of non-GAAP measures, adjusted sales totaled $9.7 billion for the June quarter, which was $1.4 billion higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was $4 billion, which was $1 billion higher than our reported gross margin. And adjusted net income was $1.9 billion, $700 million higher than our reported net income.  We continue to believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in you analysis and understanding of our performance.  Turning to the details of our results, I would like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated outstanding sales of 2.6 million Macs, setting a new June quarter record and nearly meeting the all-time quarterly record we set last September. Mac sales increased by more than 100,000 units over the prior year\u2019s June quarter. This represents 4% year-over-year growth and compares favorably to IDC\u2019s latest published estimate of a 3% contraction for the market overall.  We followed up the transition of our entire desktop lineup in March with significant updates to our entire portable lineup in the June quarter, delivering increased performance and value across the lines.  Mac portable shipments increased 13% year over year, driven by continued strong growth in sales of Macbooks and our new Macbook Pros. Customer response to the new portables has been very favorable and we saw an acceleration of sales following the launch.  We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory.  Now I\u2019ll turn to our music product. We sold 10.2 million iPods, which was down from 11 million in the year-ago quarter. There were two key reasons for this decline -- first, we reduced channel inventory by over 400,000. Second, sell-through declined by 4% year over year.  I would like to discuss how we are looking at this market. We have three categories of what we call pocket products. Traditional MP3 players, iPod Touch, and iPhone. For traditional MP3 players, which includes Shuffle, Nano, and Classic, we saw a year-over-year decline which we internally had forecasted to occur. This is one of the original reasons we developed the iPhone and the iPod Touch. We expect our traditional MP3 players to decline over time as we cannibalize ourselves with the iPod Touch and the iPhone.  However, we have a great business that we believe will last for many, many years and which we will continue to manage well and offer the world\u2019s most innovative products.  Despite the decline in our sales, our research shows that about 50% of our recent traditional iPod purchasers are buying their first iPod, including those in our high market share countries such as the U.S., Japan, Australia, Canada, and the U.K.  The iPod Touch did extremely well in the quarter, growing more than 130% year over year. Customers continue to embrace this outstanding platform experience, which has been increasingly enhanced by the tremendous offering for the App store.  Our share of the U.S. market continues to be over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod was the top-selling MP3 player and continued to gain share year over year in nearly every country we track, based on the latest data published by GFK.  We began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.  I would now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold over 5.2 million handsets in the June quarter, compared to 717,000 handsets sold in the year-ago quarter. Response to the new iPhone 3GS has been tremendous, with over 1 million 3GS handsets sold by the third day after its June 19th launch.  We are currently unable to make enough iPhone 3GS\u2019 to meet robust demand and we are working to address this.  Customers and reviewers have been very impressed by its improved speed, 3-megapixel autofocus camera, video recording capability, and hands-free voice control. The iPhone 3GS is available in 18 countries today and we are quickly rolling it out this summer to the rest of the 80-plus countries where iPhones are sold.  Customers are loving the new iPhone OS 3.0 release, which includes more than 100 new features, including cut, copy, and paste, MMS, spotlight search, a landscape keyboard for mail, and expanded parental controls for iTunes and App Store content.  The App Store now offers over 65,000 applications and the iPhone OS 3.0 software has helped pave the way for developers to create even more innovation applications with many new features, including in-App purchases, a new maps API, peer-to-peer connections, and push notification.  Customer response to the App Store has been phenomenal and we were thrilled to announce the 1.5 billionth download last week.  The App Store is a key strategic differentiator of the iPhone and iPod Touch experience and we believe that outstanding software is the key ingredient for a great mobile experience.  Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales, and carrier payments was $1.69 billion during the quarter, compared to $419 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 300%. The sales value of iPhones sold during the quarter was $2.9 billion.  Since we announced specific new features of iPhone OS 3.0 on March 17th, we did not begin to recognize revenue or product costs for any iPhone sold from March 17th until the iPhone OS 3.0 software became available on June 17th. For those iPhones, revenue and product costs are being recognized ratably over the remaining terms of their respective 24-month estimated lives from June 17th forward.  The iTunes Store delivered another great quarter, fueled by strong sales of music, video, and apps. With the introduction of the iPhone OS 3.0 last month, the iTunes experience keeps getting better. iPhone OS 3.0 software allows customers to wirelessly download movies, TV, and audio programs directly to an iPhone or iPod Touch and I am pleased to report that as of last week, customers had purchased and downloaded over 8 billion songs from the iTunes store, yet another remarkable milestone.  I would like to now turn to the Apple retail stores. The stores recognized $1.5 billion of revenue during the June quarter, compared to $1.45 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our stores sold 492,000 Macs compared to 476,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter and about half the Macs sold in our stores during the June quarter were to customers who never owned a Mac before.  We opened six new stores during the quarter, bringing us to 258 stores, and we also completed 27 store remodels.  With an average of 254 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5.9 million compared to $6.8 million in the year-ago quarter.  Retail segment margin was $321 million, or 21.5%, up from $297 million or 20.6% in the year-ago quarter.  We hosted 38.6 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 31.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%.  We successfully launched the new and improved one-to-one program and hosted a record 667,000 personal training sessions during the quarter.  We remain on track to open a total of about 25 stores during fiscal 2009 and to complete the remodel of 100 stores to our new design.  We are also looking forward to opening our first store in France during the holiday quarter.  Total company gross margin was 36.3%, which was 330 basis points better than our guidance. This difference was primarily driven by three factors. First, component costs did increase but not to the level we had expected.  Second, we spent less than we had expected in several operating areas, including warranty and manufacturing tools.  And third, we efficiently ramped our new products in the quarter, spending less than we had planned.  Additionally, and to a lesser extent, we benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and from leverage on higher revenue than we planned.  Operating expenses were $1.35 billion, consistent with our guidance and included $151 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $60 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 29%.  Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $31.1 billion at the end of the June quarter, compared to $28.9 billion at the end of the March quarter, an increase of over $2.2 billion. Cash flow from operations in the June quarter was $2.3 billion.  Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital, which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high quality investment and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio. And while it is not reflected in our June quarter results, in the first week of a September quarter, we made a $500 million pre-payment to Toshiba for future supply of NAND Flash.  Looking ahead to the September quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.  We will continue our practice of providing guidance based on GAAP and we\u2019ll report our September quarter non-GAAP financial measures to you in October when we release our results.  Forecasting in the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging, so we will continue to provide a range of guidance for the September quarter. We expect revenue to be between $8.7 billion and $8.9 billion. We expect gross margin to be about 34%, reflecting approximately $28 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $1.445 billion, including $150 million related to stock-based compensation.  We expect OI&E to be about $30 million, reflective of a short-term interest rate environment, and we expect the tax rate to be about [30%]. We are targeting EPS in the range of about $1.18 to $1.23.  In closing, we are thrilled to report record June quarter results and with customers reception of our new portables, iPhone OS 3.0, and the iPhone 3GS. We are very enthusiastic about the upcoming launch of Snow Leopard and the enhanced performance and user experience it will offer to our Mac customers. We remain confident in our strategy and new product pipeline and we are working hard to continue to deliver the industry\u2019s most exciting and innovative products.  With that, I would like to open the call to questions. \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon and congratulations. Two brief questions -- first on the Mac side judging by the product lead times, the demand for the new lower priced Macbook Pro caught you off guard. How do you see that demand trending through the September quarter? And second, can you just talk from a high level how you see the relationships with the wireless carriers evolving?\nTimothy D. Cook: In terms of the Macbook Pro, there are a couple of models that are somewhat constrained today but I believe we will get beyond this in the next few weeks. We don\u2019t feel that the constraint had a material effect on last quarter and we factored our view of supply into the guidance that Peter shared with you.  In terms of the relationship with the wireless carriers, I think that most of the carriers that we are doing business with are thrilled over the lower churn that they experienced with iPhone and the higher ARPUs and of course, their customers are demanding the iPhone and so I feel like we\u2019ve got a very good set of relationships and we are obviously continuing to look to expand those. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Maybe to ask it more specifically, do you see opportunities beyond the iPhone with the carriers, for example, AT&T with data plans and laptops, or AT&T\u2019s living room initiative with [inaudible]?\nTimothy D. Cook: We have nothing to announce today in terms of other things with the carriers. We are very focused on working with the carriers on iPhone. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, and then I guess on AT&T, any update on the status of that relationship?\nTimothy D. Cook: I think it\u2019s an excellent relationship and we are very happy with it. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Great. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bill Fearnley with FTN Equity Capital. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Thanks. If I could on the mix here, when you look at consumer spending and then you look at K-12 and state and local government and the pro segment in the quarter, is there any detail you can give, particularly on the education and the pro segments? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nTimothy D. Cook: Sure, Bill. Relative to the market, the consumer market performed relatively better for us. The U.S. K-12 institutional business is weak, as you might expect and it\u2019s getting hit by budget shortfalls and last quarter we saw very negligible amount, if any, of the stimulus funds flow all the way to the state and district levels to get spent, so that may or may not occur this quarter.  In the pro business, the pro business has also been affected more by the economy than the consumer business is and you can see that some in our ASPs, it\u2019s people that were buying those that were in commercial accounts and small business accounts are delaying purchases. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Tim, you\u2019ve talked about higher ed growth and K-12 institutional growth before. Can you give us those numbers for this quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: Overall, we were negative 6% in the institutional business. The K-12 business was more negative than that and the higher ed business was around the 0% level. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Okay, and then one other, if I could -- in terms of preliminary view after the price changes on mix with the older Macbook, the 999, and then the newer form factor, any additional details you can give us on the first 30 days of what you saw about mix shift with the price changes?\nTimothy D. Cook: Generally, as you can see from the data sheet that you\u2019ve got, our units grew faster than our revenue in the portable area, and so ASP did fall some and one of the reasons is the price cuts that we took; another is the transitional cost of doing that. What was a major transition of replacing the whole lineup basically in a day.  So we are seeing a mix down versus historic and we think part of that is that the commercial customer who was buying up in the line is delaying purchases in this weak economy.  Of course, we\u2019re thrilled with our overall results -- to grow 4% with IDC forecasting a negative 3 and Gardner forecasting a negative 5, that puts us 7 to 9 points ahead of the market and we are thrilled with those performance numbers. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Bailey from Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: I know you don\u2019t break out the SKUs of the iPhone explicitly but can you give us some idea of how the $99 iPhone is doing relative to the other price points? And have you see a change in mix since the launch, either away from or toward the lower end phone?\nTimothy D. Cook: There\u2019s two pieces of information I can give you, David. One is that as we made the changes, the two changes, both the launch of the 3GS and the price reduction of the 3G, we saw a significant acceleration in total unit sales. I don\u2019t want to give you the precise mix because we view that as competitive data and obviously want to hold that tight.  As Peter alluded to in his opening comments, the iPhone 3GS is currently constrained in virtually every country that we are shipping in, and so the demand for it has been very robust and I think it speaks to the great product that it is and we are working very hard to fill that demand. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great, and then just a follow-up on that -- can you give us an update on the progress you have made in large enterprise accounts with the iPhone and how you look at that opportunity over the next year?\nTimothy D. Cook: Well, I think it\u2019s a great opportunity for us and as you might guess, we are seeing growing interest with the release of the 3GS and iPhone OS 3.0, due in part to the new hardware encryption and the improved security policies.  The phone is particularly doing well with small business and with large organizations that allow people to purchase the phones for individual use, and this is both in corporate and government settings.  Specifically, to give you some numbers, almost 20% of the Fortune 100 have purchased at least 10,000 units or more and there\u2019s now multiple corporations and government agencies who have purchased in excess of 25,000 each.  We also had the iPhone approved in over 300 higher education institutions and so we feel really good about how we are doing and you may have noticed also that the most recent study by J.D. Powers has ranked the iPhone the highest in overall satisfaction with business customers, and so we think that we are just at the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the iPhone can do with the business customer. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks a lot.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, David. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thanks. Peter, I was just wondering, regarding your revenue guidance, you are guiding up roughly 4% to 7% sequentially but you\u2019ve got a couple hundred million of iPhone deferred revenue coming off the balance sheet and obviously you are doing very well with the new products. So I was wondering why you are guiding generally in line with last year\u2019s increase and maybe a little bit below what we consider normal seasonality for the September quarter. Thanks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Rich, we give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving, so no change in our thinking.  Let me talk a little bit about Mac and iPod and iPhone. For Mac, while we usually see an increase in Mac units from the June to September quarters, and we expect to see one this year, we would expect the sequential increase to be less than previous years, since we refreshed every portable last quarter and the desktops in the March quarter, making the comparison sequentially tougher for us.  Additionally, as Tim just commented, the U.S. institution, education institution sales remain under pressure from some budget shortfalls.  As regard the iPod, similar to June we would expect the traditional MP3 players to decline year over year but iPod Touch to grow significantly.  And for phone, last year we sold very few phones in the June quarter as a result of the July transition and $7 million in September, which included 2 million units [of channel fill]. This year we introduced the iPhone 3GS in June, selling 5.2 million in the quarter and in terms of assessing how we will do going from June to September, we are very optimistic about the product, it\u2019s off to a great start but we just don\u2019t have any experience in this seasonality with distribution as wide as we\u2019ve got it, so we\u2019ll report to you in October how we did. \nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Thanks, Peter. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Thank you very much. Peter, could you talk about gross margins? You\u2019ve obviously the last two quarters handily exceeded any of your expectations and guiding above, at one point you said 30% for September and now we\u2019re at 34%. And does that mean that the long-term estimate of 30% no longer holds and that we should probably model something at least higher than 30 due to maybe better execution or something in your business model that\u2019s changed?\nPeter Oppenheimer: The teams are executing phenomenally well and so that\u2019s something that we are very proud of and I think the results have benefited from that.  You know, regarding gross margins for the September quarter, we\u2019ve had a chance to go through our complete process and I\u2019m guiding to 34% for the September quarter, which is down from the 36% that we just reported.  We expect the margins to decline sequentially as a result of a full quarter of back to school promotion and a full quarter of our new portables and also higher component costs.  I don\u2019t want to make comments today about future quarters but I will give you a couple of things that are on our mind. First, for many key components, costs are rising and you are seeing that in the market as well. And secondly, we will continue to focus on delivering state-of-the-art products at price points that our competitors can\u2019t match and we are going to provide customers ever-increasing value. And so as you think about quarters beyond September, I would urge you to consider those factors. \nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Okay, thanks and with regard to the surge at the end of the quarter of iPhones, 5.2 million and you\u2019re constrained on the 3GS, what is the inventory situation like? I mean, you were running at over a million, I believe, Tim, and how did you end the quarter on inventory? And how is the pent-up demand look though heading into the next one?\nTimothy D. Cook: The iPhone channel inventory was flat sequentially, so it was approximately the same number from the beginning of the quarter and at the end of the quarter. And what that means obviously since we were selling a lot more units at the end, that we do not have a channel loaded with the number of units that we would like at this time and you can see that in terms of stock-outs on the 3GS. \nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: What\u2019s that unit number, and then I\u2019ll cede the floor here?\nTimothy D. Cook: The unit number?\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Of inventory?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, consistent with what I\u2019ve said before, you can do the math, but it\u2019s about 1.83 million, just slightly over 1.8. \nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Thanks a lot, Tim. \nTimothy D. Cook: That includes in-transits that we\u2019ve invoiced and demos we\u2019ve counted in a conservative manner. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Ben. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from William Shope with Credit Suisse.\nWilliam Shope - Credit Suisse: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Looking at the response you\u2019ve seen on the 999 Macbook and the more recent Macbook Pro price cuts, can you comment on whether the Mac business is more or less elastic than you previously anticipated and perhaps give us an idea of how you thinking about elasticity in this business over the longer term?\nTimothy D. Cook: We are obviously thrilled with the results that we\u2019ve had since we done the portable announcement. Mac sales did accelerate after the announcement [at WWDC] and shipment of the portables and we feel great about how they are selling.  As we expected, there\u2019s some number of people that are buying up because they can now get a Macbook Pro from $1199, whereas it wasn\u2019t too many months ago that to buy a Macbook Pro, it would cost $1999, and so we\u2019ve made a significant change there.  So we are not thinking fundamentally different about the Mac business than we were before. Our goal has been and continues to be to build the best computers in the world and when we can do that at lower prices, we do that. When we can\u2019t, we won't put the Apple brand on a product that doesn\u2019t stand for innovation and doesn\u2019t have the legendary ease of use that we are known for. \nWilliam Shope - Credit Suisse: Okay, and then just so we\u2019re all on the same page -- any chance you can give us some quantitative color on the gross margin EPS impact from the delayed iPhone recognition in the June quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I can\u2019t do anything specifically. You can make an estimate of what the revenues might have been, now that you know the June quarter sales and you can take a shot at the related gross margin. \nWilliam Shope - Credit Suisse: Okay, great, we\u2019ll do that. Thanks. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you give us an update on Snow Leopard and how we should think about the $29 price point? I\u2019m kind of curious as to what drove the decision to go so low and how are you thinking about potential adoption rates?\nTimothy D. Cook: Snow Leopard is an even better Leopard. It redefines about 90% of the projects which make up OS10 and it includes a lot of powerful new core technologies and builds Microsoft Exchange support right into the OS, which is something that even Windows PCs do not do.  We have priced it very aggressively so that all of our users can upgrade to it and we are hoping that they do that.  As we announced at WWDC, we expect -- we continue to expect to ship it later this quarter. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the commodities -- I\u2019m just curious as to which ones you expect to be sort of challenging going forward and how should we think about the pre-buy with Toshiba and should we continue to expect additional pre-buys, depending on what you think in terms of inventory and demand and pricing?\nTimothy D. Cook: In terms of going forward, the market for DRAM and the market for large sized LCDs have shifted to a constrained environment, and the pricing has moved accordingly. The NAND Flash market has now begun to stabilize and we expect it to move toward a supply demand balance.  Hard drives and optical drives are now recovering from some supply constraints and pricing is declining at less than historical rates as a result.  In terms of the Toshiba pre-buy, we did a long-term supply agreement with Toshiba. As a part of that, as part of the terms and conditions, we paid them $500 million as a pre-pay earlier in the quarter, as Peter had said. You know, we view Flash as a very key component for us because as you know we use it in so much or so many of our products and also we are a reasonable percentage of the user of Flash on a worldwide basis.  In terms of doing additional deals, we are always open to doing additional deals with the right terms and conditions and as you know, we\u2019ve done two in this fiscal year. We announced the one with LG earlier on LCDs and we may do others but there\u2019s not one that we are currently working on but I don\u2019t close that door because we are always looking at different things. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Great. Thank you very much. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. I think last quarter you had commented that the percentage of 999 Macs had increased sequentially. Can you comment on this quarter -- it sounds like there was a mix shift to the low-end because of continued economic uncertainty, yet you lowered Mac prices, which was stimulative or -- excuse me, Macbook Pro prices which was stimulative for the Pro. So give us a sense on how consumers netted out -- was your 999 offering a bigger percentage of total Mac notebooks this quarter than it was last quarter, and can you give us a little more color on the dynamic?\nTimothy D. Cook: Toni, I don\u2019t want to give you exact mix numbers for competitive reasons but let me share with you at a macro point what we saw happening last quarter. After the transition, not our -- our non-education business, we saw a people up-selling from the 999 to the 1199 Macbook Pro. Obviously for $200, it\u2019s a significant amount of features and so we saw that occurring last quarter.  Before the transition, we saw a mix that was larger than after it to the 999, but we did see that change at the developers\u2019 conference.  Education itself, when you carve education itself out, the bulk of what K-12 would buy would be the lower priced unit and we sell it for even lower prices than the consumer price, obviously. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then can you comment on the dynamics on the iPhone side -- it sounds like the lower price point, the $99 3G phone actually served perhaps more as a traffic driver for the 3GS phone than you would have anticipated. Do you think that was ultimately its role or is that product in and of itself a meaningful contributor to the iPhone story?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know, we are focused on total iPhone units and so we are very happy when the total comes out to the 5.2 number that came out and we are thrilled [at that]. I think it\u2019s too early to tell what the ultimate mix of those products will be because as you know, the iPhone 3GS is constrained and also it\u2019s only shipping in 18 countries of the 80-plus that we are in, and so I think it will take some amount of time. Also, there\u2019s a phenomenon at the beginning of purchasing where you had people upgrading and those people that upgrade are obviously more likely to select the new phone, and so it\u2019s only been a few weeks and I wouldn\u2019t want to make any grand statements about what things will happen in the longer term. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then one for Peter -- Peter, I think your sequential gross margin guidance in terms of sequential decline is actually more benign than you have guided for in each of the last two years, which is surprising to me because the component environment I think is tougher than its\u2019 been in either of the last two years. Your back-to-school promotion in terms of geographic breadth are considerably broader this quarter and you have notebook price cuts, which you didn\u2019t have in either of the previous fiscal Q4s.  So was it -- is the offset in terms of your guiding to a lower gross margin sequential decline, is that all iPhone related or are there other considerations relative to previous years that we ought to be thinking about?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Toni, it\u2019s always hard to talk about gross margin year over year because you are typically in different product cycles and you have different component environments and currencies can be different and mixes and a variety of things, so it\u2019s hard.  We are benefiting from a higher mix of iPhone revenues and that is beneficial to our gross margin. So as I think about this year versus last, sure, that is a factor. But as we put our guidance together for the September quarter, we\u2019ve gone through our normal process and we thought about supply, we thought about demand and it resulted in the 34% that we provided you. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: And then final question, you mentioned you lowered channel inventory on iPod about 400,000 units. Should we be thinking about the reduction in channel inventory being somewhat consistent as a percentage of what you anticipate for reduced iPhone sales in the following quarter? Or otherwise, why would you have taken it down by that amount?\nTimothy D. Cook: Toni, if you look at the over 400K that we reduced it by, there were two primary reasons. The first reason was that as you may remember in March, we announced and launched a new shuffle very close to the end of the quarter and also Easter, the Easter holiday was at the beginning of the June quarter, and so to support both of these, we ended March with a bit more inventory. Although still within the target range of four to six weeks.  With these events behind us, we were able to reduce channel inventory and this accounted for about half of the over 400K unit reduction.  The second reason is the overall demand was lower and we believe that this is due to the weak economy, cannibalization from iPhone, and the reduction in the market size for traditional MP3 players that as you heard Peter\u2019s definition for this, we call traditional MP3 players the Shuffle, the Nano, and the Classic.  And as a result of this, we adjusted channel inventories to correspond with this lower demand and this accounted for the balance of the over 400K unit reduction.  But as a reminder, I don\u2019t want to overstate this but we began and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks and so we are staying within the rails that we have forever set as targets. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks very much. Tim, there\u2019s competitors that are unveiling application stores now and media and touch features via software -- can you just talk about maybe the dimensions along which you see continuing to out-innovate competitor user experiences and maintain iPhone momentum and share leadership?\nTimothy D. Cook: Sure, Mike. You know, I don\u2019t want to talk very much about what we have planned in the future but if I just sort of summarize just what\u2019s happened in the last 90 days, we have just shipped the next major version of the world\u2019s most advanced mobile software platform with iPhone 3.0 and the App Store is now available in 77 countries, and reaches an installed base that is now more than 45 million. That\u2019s the sum of iPhone plus iPod Touch.  The App Store I think by any measure has been an unprecedented success with over 65,000 apps now in the store and over 1.5 billion apps downloaded. As you may remember, if you look at the App number, the over 65,000 from the store, that compares to the latest numbers we have for RIM and Nokia put them between 1,000 and 2,000 each. And the latest published number that we\u2019ve seen on Android puts it less than 5,000.  And so we feel like we have a substantial lead on apps for the phone, on software for the phone, and we think we have brought a great deal of hardware innovation for the phone as well. And so we feel extremely good about our competitive position and continue to believe that we are years ahead of other people. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thanks. And do you see additional distribution and pricing models important to sustain either your growth in market share gains in iPhone and do you think you can sustain growth based on the current strategy?\nTimothy D. Cook: Well, I think we just took a major change with the introduction of a $99 product and so the reason we did that was obviously because we knew that there was elasticity there. And in regard to your other question, we are working very hard to continue expanding distribution, both within countries that we\u2019re in where it makes sense to do so and to add new countries because the world has more 80 countries in it, and so we are looking at both of those and we recognize there are some large markets left uncovered currently. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay, thanks. And then just lastly, does the positive response to the Mac price cuts provide you some pause regarding the opportunity that you might have for similar momentum for lower priced entry level PCs? In other words, do you still feel that the lower priced PC category is perhaps not attractive versus your business model? I may not exactly be paraphrasing what you said last time but along those lines. \nTimothy D. Cook: Mike, I would say it differently, really and maybe I haven\u2019t expressed it well -- our goal is not to build the most computers; it\u2019s to build the best. And we will -- whatever price point that we can build the best at, we will play there. At this point, we don\u2019t see a way to build a great product for this 399, 499 this kind of price point unit and we -- but you know, and as I\u2019ve said before and I think this is playing out in several areas, I think some customers, maybe many customers buying these are -- become disappointed and disenchanted after they buy one of these, and so we are going to continue to focus on what we have always done, is making the best, the most innovative, and giving people tremendous value and I feel like the moves that we\u2019ve made across this quarter really puts an exclamation point on those.  When you look at being now able to buy a Macbook Pro for $800 less than someone could have done in October of last year, it\u2019s just jaw-dropping. And so we feel very good about our strategy and our pricing and I think frankly the results bear it out. If you look at it now, we\u2019ve now -- the Mac has outrun the market a staggering 18 of the last 19 quarters, and I think that really says that we do have the right approach. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Thank you very much, Tim. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Mike. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andy Hargreaves with Pacific Crest.\nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities: I\u2019m just wondering on the iPhone -- the services and apps, they are obviously growing really fast -- is that putting or is the growth there constrained do you think by the network capacity of your carrier partners?\nTimothy D. Cook: I think that\u2019s a better question for them but what I see without talking about specific ones, I see them making more investment in order to have faster networks and see them being very happy about driving higher ARPUs and lower churn. You know, this changes their cost of customer acquisition if they are not out churning people left and right and so I think they will continue to make investments to deliver services that people really enjoy, which is faster networks. \nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities: Do you think you guys will end up making investments on the side, whether it\u2019s a knock or a data center or something to help take some of the pressure off them or offload some of that capacity?\nTimothy D. Cook: We have no plan to do so. You know, when we entered this business, we looked at it and came to a conclusion that what we could do really well was deliver a world-class handset because of our hardware and software skills and that we could uniquely play in that world and deliver something that was revolutionary.  I think there are other people that have much more skills at networks and I think we are dealing with a lot of those as partners. I think that\u2019s their business and they are quite good at it. \nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities: Okay. Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Andy. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. A couple of follow-ups, Tim, first on the conversation around 399, 499 netbook or whatever you want to call it -- I understand that the ability of Apple to make something that is high quality at that price point is limited but do you think there is perhaps an emerging market for a truly mobile device that would have perhaps a larger screen where you can do more with it than on the iPhone that is big enough that you may want to participate at, regardless of price?\nTimothy D. Cook: I never want to discount anything in the future and never want to specifically answer a question on new products, as you probably know, Katy. The point I am making right now is that I think most customers that are buying a portable want a full featured notebook and we delivered those and delivered some incredible values in those and we feel like, and we know from our research the customers are very happy with those. I think some of the netbooks that are being delivered or many of those are -- have very -- are very slow. They have software technology that is old. They don\u2019t have a robust computing experience. They lack horsepower. They have small displays and cramped keyboards -- you know, I could go on and on but I won't.  And so that kind of thing I think many people will not be happy with and we are only going to play in things where we can deliver something that is very innovative that we are very proud of. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bryan Marshall with Broadpoint Amtech.\nBryan Marshall - Broadpoint Amtech: Thanks. A question with regard to iPhone activations -- based on my calculations, it seems as though that the U.S. has represented about 40% or so of the total activations over the last couple of quarters. I mean, should we be entering a point here where the international side should start to pick up here and start growing materially faster? I just wonder if you could help us think about this. \nTimothy D. Cook: We don\u2019t release the percentage of iPhone sales by geography and so I wouldn\u2019t want to get into that. We view it as competitive information.  Generally speaking, you would find that smartphones in general are being sold in larger numbers and environments where post-pay is the primary payment mechanism, not that there are zero phones being sold in pre-pay; there are some but it\u2019s much lower and so you can look at and do an analysis of where those post-pay countries are and find that there\u2019s a disproportionate number of phones relative to the total phone market being sold there but that\u2019s not unique to Apple. I think that\u2019s the reality of the smartphone market currently. \nBryan Marshall - Broadpoint Amtech: And Tim, having said that, some of your competitors are sort of tinkering around with some of the prepaid models out there. Is that something that you might be interested in down the road?\nTimothy D. Cook: Well, we\u2019re doing that as well and we see by prepay in markets that are predominantly prepay and I think we have more to learn in that environment. I think this is an environment where we are still a beginner in some ways and I think can make drastic improvements.  I think our business model works quite well in the post-pay category but pre-pay is an opportunity for us. We are trying it in both markets where post-pay is dominant of the two and we are trying it where pre-pay is the dominant, so we have multiple things going on right now and hopefully we\u2019ll learn from that and improve as we move forward. \nBryan Marshall - Broadpoint Amtech: Okay, final question -- any help you can give with regard to the percent of the iPod Touch user base, which we calculate north of 20 million at this point, that actually upgraded to the new iPhone 3.0 software?\nTimothy D. Cook: I would call it a good number and I don\u2019t want to be more specific but obviously we priced that extremely aggressively and we are very much wanting to get the platform out there. It\u2019s great for our ecosystem and the developers will sell more apps as a part of that and so we tried very hard to get people to upgrade. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Bryan. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Whitemore from Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitemore - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Do the supply constraints on the iPhone 3GS in any way impact your rollout for the remaining countries? Or put another way, when do you expect supply demand to reach equilibrium for the iPhone?\nTimothy D. Cook: Let me answer both questions -- one, I don\u2019t want to predict today when supply and demand will balance. I know that it will not balance in the short-term and I don\u2019t want to give a prediction because as you can guess, it\u2019s very difficult to gauge the demand without having the supply there to find out what it is, and so I don\u2019t want to do that.  In terms of affecting the country rollout, I believe the vast majority of the countries that we are selling the 3G in will be selling the 3GS by the end of the fiscal quarter. So it may move a date by a few weeks here or there but I think the vast majority will be shipping in by the end of the fiscal quarter. \nChris Whitemore - Deutsche Bank: Tim, any update on the iPhone in China?\nTimothy D. Cook: Nothing to work, nothing to add today specifically, other than it continues to be a priority project and we hope to be there within a year. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Chris. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: And we\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Wolf with Needham & Company.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: I have a couple of questions. On sales of the iPhone, could you share with us any information you have regarding the division between new activations and upgrades?\nTimothy D. Cook: Charlie, I can\u2019t share that information. Some of that information is confidential to the carriers themselves. The customer signs up with a carrier. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Okay, well, let me ask a question about the App Store then -- in terms of application prices, there appears to be a race to the bottom. I\u2019ve noticed that there\u2019s an increasing number of $0.99 offerings. Do you regard this as a concern and if so, are you taking any steps to enable consumers to separate quality apps from the garbage?\nTimothy D. Cook: Charlie, we are always looking for ways to categorize apps differently and we do have some ideas in this area. As you know, today we do it by type of App and also have show popular apps and top-selling apps, et cetera.  We realize there\u2019s opportunity there for further improvement and are working on that.  In terms of the price, the developer sets the price and so it\u2019s up to the developer what to charge and I think what they are doing is they are doing what any good business person would do, is doing the elasticity analysis and deciding where to best set their price. I would think as the installed base grows more and more and more, it makes more and more sense to have a bit lower prices and -- but that\u2019s totally up to the developers and I am sure each of them may do that in a little different manner. \nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Charlie, and thanks to everyone.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple's COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share, and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2008, the Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of 2009, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased to report the best non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings in our history. These results exceeded our expectations and we continue to be very pleased with our performance in this economy. Revenue for the quarter was $8.16 billion, representing 9% growth over the prior March quarter\u2019s results. Operating margin percentage for the quarter was one of our highest ever at 20.4%, primarily due to higher than anticipated revenue and gross margin. Net income was $1.2 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.33. In terms of non-GAAP measure, adjusted sales totaled $9.06 billion for the March quarter, which was $900 million higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was $3.62 billion, which was $650 million higher than our reported gross margin, and adjusted net income was $1.66 billion, $450 million higher than our reported net income. We continue to believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis and understanding of our performance. Turning to the details of our results, I\u2019d like to begin with our Mac products and services. For the March quarter, we sold 2.22 million Macs compared to 2.29 million Macs in the year-ago quarter, a 3% decline. In the year-ago March quarter, Mac sales increased 51% year-over-year due in part to January 2008 launch of the MacBook Air, creating a very difficult compare. Our Mac shipments in this year\u2019s March quarter compares favorably to the 7% year-over-year contraction in the market overall, based on the latest estimate for the quarter, published by IDC. We successfully transitioned the entire Mac desktop line in March and continue to see a strong year-over-year growth in MacBook shipments. Our overall units sell through of Macs was flat year-over-year and given the tough year-over-year comp and the challenging economic environment, we feel very positive about our Mac performance. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. We experienced strong sales with January releases of iLife \u201909 and iWork \u201909. We believe the outstanding features of iLife and iWork are among the very compelling reasons why customers are drawn to the Mac experience. Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our music products and services. We sold over 11 million iPods, representing a new March quarter unit record and 3% growth over the year-ago quarter. We generated very strong year-over-year growth in sales of iPod Touch as customers continue to embrace the superior features of the platform, coupled with the rapidly growing array of applications available through the App Store. Customers and reviewers responded favorably to the March introduction of the all-new iPod Shuffle, the world\u2019s smallest music player, featuring a great new industrial design, voice-over technology, and convenient new earphone cord controls. We remain very pleased with iPod market share. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% based on the latest monthly data, published by NPD, and we continue to gain share year-over-year in both international markets based on the latest data published by GFK. We saw healthy year-over-year iPod unit sales growth in a number of large markets including the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, Australia, and China. We began and ended the quarter within our target range of 46 weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes Store delivered another great quarter, fueled by strong sales of music, video, and apps. We recently introduced a number of changes to the iTunes Store including the availability of DRM-free iTunes Plus titles from all four major labels, as well as thousands of independent artists. The App Stores continues to be an unparallel success for developers and customers and now offers over 35,000 applications compared to the 15,000 available as of our last conference call. We are within hours of reaching our 1 billionth download, an astounding number given the number of \u2013 given the short nine-month history of the App Store. We believe the App Store is a key strategic differentiator of the iPhone and iPod Touch experience and is more evidence of what we have always said, that software is a key ingredient for a great mobile experience. We continue to believe that we are years ahead of competition and we are very excited about the prospects of even more compelling apps as developers take advantage of the many new features that will enabled by the iPhone OS 3.0 this summer. Turning to the iPhone, we were extremely pleased to have sold almost 3.8 million handsets in the March quarter, a 123% increase over the 1.7 million handsets sold in the year-ago quarter. We continue to expand iPhone\u2019s geographic reach during the quarter and are now selling this in 81 countries. Revenue recognized from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales, and carrier payments was $1.52 billion compared to $378 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 300%. The sales value of iPhones sold during the quarter was over $2.2 billion. On March 17th, we provided developers with a preview of iPhone OS 3.0 and began the developer seeding process. The iPhone OS 3.0 release will include an updated software development kit with over a 1,000 new developer APIs, enabling in-app purchases, peer-to-peer connections, app control of accessories, and push notifications. The iPhone OS 3.0 release will also add over a 100 customer features including cut, copy, and paste, spotlight search, landscape keyboard and view for all key iPhone apps and MMS support. Developers have responded very enthusiastically to the new SDK and we expect that customers will love the many new features of iPhone OS 3.0 and the new apps that will be available. Because we announced these specific new features and plan to provide iPhone customers to them as a free upgrade, we have delayed the start of revenue recognition for all iPhones sold on or after March 17th announcement date until the iPhone OS 3.0 software is released this summer. The revenue and cost of sales associated with these iPhones will be recognized ratably over the remaining terms of respective 24-month estimated lives. Revenue recognition for handset sales prior to March 17th is not affected by the announcement. I\u2019d now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. The stores recognized $1.47 billion of revenue during the March quarter compared to $1.45 billion in the year-ago quarter. Our stores sold 438,000 Macs, about half of which were to customers who have never owned a Mac before. We opened one new store during the quarter, bringing us to 252 stores. With an average of 251 stores open during the quarter, average revenue per store was $5.9 million compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin was $308 million compared to $334 million in the year-ago quarter. We believe that the year-over-year decline in average store sales and segment margin is a reflection of the continued weakness in the spending environment, coupled with third party channel expansions relative to the year-ago quarter. We hosted 39.1 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 33.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 16%. We also hosted a record 644,000 personal training sessions during the quarter, an increase of 11% year-over-year. We remain on track to open a total of about 25 stores during fiscal 2009, about half of which we expect to be outside the U.S. Total company gross margin was 36.4%, which was 390 basis points better than our guidance. This difference was primarily driven by three factors. First, commodity and other hardware component costs were significantly lower than we planned. We have been very disciplined with our inventory management, which allowed us to take advantage of the continued favorable commodity market during the quarter. Second, sales of higher-margin products including software and accessories were better than planned. And third, we benefited from lower freight and warranty costs. Operating expenses were $1.3 billion including $152 million in stock-based compensation expense. OpEx was $26 million below our guidance as we spent less in many areas of the company. OI&E was $63 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 30.3%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $28.9 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $28.1 billion at the end of the December quarter. Cash flow from operations in the March quarter was $841 million. Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital, which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high-quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio. Looking ahead to the June quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We will continue our process of providing guidance based on GAAP and we will report our June quarter non-GAAP financial measures during July when we release our results. Forecasting in the current macroeconomic environment remains challenging. So, we will continue to provide a range of guidance for the June quarter. We expect revenue to be between $7.7 billion and $7.9 billion. This reflects not starting revenue recognition for iPhones sold on or after March 17th until the date of the iPhone OS 3.0 software is released. We expect gross margins to be about 33%, reflecting approximately $30 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $1.35 billion including a $150 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $55 million, reflective of the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 31%. We are targeting EPS in the range of $0.95 to $1. In closing, we are very pleased with our record March quarter results and how well Apple is performing in this economy. We are extremely enthusiastic about the launch of the iPhone OS 3.0 and can\u2019t wait to get it into customers\u2019 hands this summer. We are also very excited about the other products in our pipeline. We remain confident in our strategy and are working hard to deliver the world\u2019s most innovative and extraordinary products. With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: (Operator instructions) Your first question will come from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: All right. Thanks. Well, great job on the quarter and in the absence of too much else to pick on, I guess I\u2019ll ask the standard component question of Tim, what is your outlook in terms of pricing and component supply going into the June quarter, please?\nTim Cook: Hi, Rich. March quarter, we believed that most of the excess inventory in the supply chain was consumed. And so, where we see the component environment still being favorable on an overall basis, it will be some commodities like NAND as an example, which will increase sequentially. NAND in particular has recently increased due to reduced wafer starts from several of the suppliers attempting to address the profitability issues. Other than that, I think last quarter was about wringing out excess inventory environment we continue to be favorable, but I don\u2019t expect to see the level of reductions that we experienced in calendar quarter one.\nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: But you do expect Tim, the aggregate building materials to be down sequentially in the June quarter?\nTim Cook: I expect it to be within a similar range as last quarter.\nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: Okay. All right, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal: Hi, thanks. Peter, for you. Cash flow was actually down year-over-year. It\u2019s the first time going back for some period of time that I\u2019ve seen cash flow from operations to be down on the year-over-year for the March quarter. Could you talk about a little bit of what was driving that and specifically, was there anything on the deferred revenue recognition \u2013 the deferred balance that changed consistent with the revenue recognition policies or the like thereof when you went to the new software platform?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Keith, no, there is nothing with what iPhone or deferred revenue or cost from a policy change that played into that. I was actually very pleased with the cash generation in the quarter, was up over $700 million from the end of the December quarter. But there are three things to discuss with you that did play into the cash generation in the quarter. First, as we talked about in the last quarter\u2019s call, we did make our prepayment to LGD for $500 million [ph]. Second, you\u2019d notice that our accounts payable was down from the December to March quarter by over $700 million. The decline in AP as we leave the holiday quarter and conclude the March quarter is very typical for us. So, there is nothing new there, but that does play into the sequential results. The third component to discuss with you is our tax payments. We made about $1.3 billion in tax payments in the March quarter and there is a couple of things that were driving that. First of all, for the current fiscal year, so this year, fiscal \u201909, we make our first estimated tax payments in the March quarter for the current fiscal year and in fact, there are two that are due in the quarter. This year, the tax payments were higher than what we saw last year because A, we are making more money, and B, given the equity markets, the credit that the company gets from employee option and RSU gains are down. So, we paid more tax for that and then also, we prepaid some potential audit settlements that were accrued on the balance sheet, but we paid them on a cash basis this quarter for prior years and we trued up for fiscal \u201908 this quarter as well. So, all three of those things combine for $1.3 billion in tax payments this quarter and that was up significantly year-over-year.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 Bank of Montreal: Okay. Thank you, Peter.\nPeter Oppenheimer: You\u2019re welcome.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Keith. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: This will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.\nBen Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about the Mac business? It seems that desktop side exceeded our expectations, obviously due to the launch, but sequentially the ASP in desktops if my math is right, looks like it was down quite a bit. Could you just talk about what\u2019s going on in the Mac business, how the new Macs are doing, what you think of your pipeline, but also what\u2019s going on with ASPs like \u2013 am I right that there was a mix down in the desktop area and just what\u2019s going on in particular with regard to the mix with this tough economy in maybe notebooks and desktops?\nTim Cook: Okay. Hi Ben, it\u2019s Tim.\nBen Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Hi Tim.\nTim Cook: Across the quarter, as we got into March and announced a completely new desktop line, we saw an acceleration of sales and it was that acceleration that allowed us on a sell-through basis to approximately be equal to the year before. After we did the desktop launch, we began to ship a higher mix of desktops than we were before the transition and that helped to push the overall ASP down. Within the desktops themselves, the top end of the line, Mac Pro, we had a lower mix to the Mac Pro, a higher mix to the Mac mini than we had before the transition and really all throughout the quarter, the Pro products that are primarily being sold to the creative professionals, were weaker than they were in the year-ago quarter and we believe that that\u2019s mainly economic related, as you would guess, businesses are cutting back on technology expenditures. In addition, education in the U.S. contracted by about 11% year-over-year and this is a result of states not having the tax revenues as projected and we are hoping that as we get into this quarter that the stimulus funds that were approved last quarter begin to flow to the states and we see some benefit from that. But that remains to be seen. So, net-net, yes, ASP did decline, it was \u2013 desktops were a piece of it, but doing all the desktops in a single day, which was \u2013 it\u2019s unprecedented for us to do that, really helped us drive more sales in March and get the Mac business to a much better level by the end of the quarter. In the notebook business, we did have an ASP decline sequentially and that was mainly driven by a higher mix to the $999 MacBook that we had announced partway through the quarter in the October \u2013 late October timeframe. I think that\u2019s actually a good thing, not a bad thing, because I think what you see is, for us anyway, the consumer is holding up much better than the professional, and much better than education. Education is gated by tax receipts and funding and the professional is really cutting back expenses and delaying \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s business we are losing necessarily, but delaying purchases.\nBen Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: It\u2019s no secret that the netbook is obviously doing pretty well. Do you have any thoughts there on that category now that you\u2019ve been able to watch it for a few quarters and what you are thinking and it has obviously held up the market a bit in the recent data and you don\u2019t have it, and you still outperformed the market? Just any thoughts on where you are and where you aren\u2019t that you might want to share?\nTim Cook: For us, it\u2019s about doing great products. And when I look at what is being sold in the netbook space today, I see cramped keyboards, terrible software, junky hardware, very small screens, and just not a consumer experience, and not something that we would put the Mac brand on quite frankly. And so, it\u2019s not a space as it exists today that we are interested in, nor do we believe that customers in the long term would be interested in. It\u2019s a segment we would choose not to play in. That said, we do look at the space and are interested to see our customers\u2019 respond to it. People that want a small computer so to speak that does browsing and e-mail, might want to buy an iPod Touch or they might want to buy an iPhone. And so, we have other products to accomplish some of what people are buying netbooks for and so, in that particular way we play in an indirect basis. And then of course, if we find a way where we can deliver an innovative product that really makes a contribution, then we will do that and we have some interesting ideas in the space. The product pipeline is fantastic for the Mac. We are \u2013 as we look back over the last four plus years, 17 of the 18 quarters of the last four-and-a-half years, we\u2019ve exceeded the market rate of growth. And to exceed in this horrendous economy, I think is quite an accomplishment, especially when you look at the \u2013 that these very low-priced netbooks that are \u2013 I think it\u2019s a stretch to call it a personal computer, are really propping up the unit numbers from the industry as a whole. So, we feel great about our performance. It\u2019s a very solid performance, especially in this environment and the pipeline looks fantastic.\nBen Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: All right, great. Well, I\u2019ll be there in June and look forward to hearing from you. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Okay.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Bill Fearnley with FTN Equity Capital.\nBill Fearnley \u2013 FTN Equity Capital: Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Could I ask a question here on the App Store? Is there any additional color you can give even directionally on the mix between paid and free downloads on the App Store overall, any additional color between the iPhone and the iPod Touch, and then I had a quick follow-up, if I could?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I\u2019m sorry. We don\u2019t disclose the free versus the paid, but we are just hours away from our billionth download and couldn\u2019t be happier with the Store\u2019s results.\nTim Cook: Bill, this is Tim. I would add to that a couple of things. One, one of the keys behind the growth of the iPod this quarter despite the economic environment was that the iPod Touch more than doubled year-over-year. So, it was a tremendous result and as Peter mentioned earlier in his remarks, the sum of iPhone plus iPod Touch is now about 37 million units and so, it provides an enormous platform for developers to develop on and with the \u2013 with our recent SDK changes the developers are working on now, I think it just unleashes a whole new level of innovation that keeps Apple years ahead of everyone else.\nBill Fearnley \u2013 FTN Equity Capital: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then, could you guys provide the direct/indirect sales mix for the quarter and did it have an effect on gross margins for the quarters and does it have any bearing on your guidance here for the third quarter? Thanks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, the direct percent in the March quarter was 48%. It really didn\u2019t have a bearing on gross margin that was reasonably close to what we thought. Now, as we enter the June quarter, the education buying season begins and that is one of the reasons why I expect gross margin to be down sequentially along with the impact of the U.S. dollar and the commodity and component environment.\nBill Fearnley \u2013 FTN Equity Capital: Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Bill. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Bill Shope\nBill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse: Okay thanks guys. Given your gross margin performance over the past several quarters as well as the guidance, how should we think about the long-term 30% gross margin target that you\u2019ve mentioned in the past. It seems that just looking at the product mix, particularly on a GAAP basis is mathematically very difficult to get there without some fairly drastic changes to the business model. How do you guys think about that longer-term?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well I have given you our guidance for the June quarter at about 33%. For the September quarter, I think our gross margins would be about 30%. We \u2013 I\u2019m not going to make comments on fiscal \u201810. I think the important part is as you look forward, it\u2019s just to understand that we are very, very focused on delivering extraordinary products to our customers and we\u2019re going to provide them ever increasing value and we just don\u2019t want you to count on the gross margins that you\u2019ve recently seen which have benefited from just a tremendous commodity and component environment.\nBill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse: Okay. And then you sort of mentioned this when you talked about consumer versus professional and education, but would you say that you\u2019re seeing any signs of stabilization in the consumer market that some of the other tech companies decided in recent weeks and with that in mind, can you comment on the linearity of the quarter and what you sort of saw on a trend line basis as you progressed through the quarter.\nTim Cook: Yes, Bill, we\u2019re not \u2013 we are not economist and so we are not entering the game of predicting bottoms and that sort of thing. We will report our results and give a view of the next quarter. But if you look at the different product areas, which is the way that we think about it, if you looked at the iPod linearity through the quarter and you overlaid last year, you would see very little difference in the two curves. We were up 3% year-over-year, and so very, very similar and not much to mention except for the point I made earlier that from a mix point of view, the iPod Touch is the runaway hit and it\u2019s clearly being driven by the App Store that we spoke about earlier. On the Mac side, as I mentioned earlier, our sells, our unit sell through had accelerated in March after we turned every desktop in the company on the same day. And so March is a very important month for the Mac business. When you look at the iPhones, the iPhones linearity to the quarter, it was reasonably linear business after the first week or two; it was very little up and down in the aggregate. Obviously it\u2019s a new business for us, it\u2019s the first March quarter that we\u2019ve had rolled out to significant number of countries and so we were exceptionally pleased to see that instead of the normal seasonality curve that one would associate with most consumer electronics.\nBill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse: Okay, very helpful. Thanks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Bill. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And it will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Hi good afternoon. Congratulations. I\u2019ve got a question on the iPod. Our survey board suggest the exclusive relationship with the AT&T is the number one reason why people don\u2019t purchase an iPhone and given the revenue shares no longer exist, can you walk us through some of your thinking in terms of why maintain an exclusive with AT&T. Just a follow-up question regarding any update on Steve Jobs? Thanks.\nTim Cook: On AT&T, Gene, we view AT&T as a very good partner. We believe that they\u2019re the best wireless provider in the US and we are very happy to be doing business with them. They have done a very good job with iPhone, they\u2019ve put the full force and weight of their company behind it, it\u2019s a major strategic thrust for them and so we\u2019re very happy with the relationship that we have and do not have a plan to change it.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Is there a structural reason why you need to maintain with AT&T from a technology perspective?\nTim Cook: Well from a technology point of view as you know, Verizon is on CDMA and we\u2019ve shown from the beginning of the iPhone to focus on one phone for the whole of the world and when you do that, you really go down the GSM root, because CDMA is \u2013 doesn\u2019t really have a life to it after a point in time.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then I guess one more before the Steve Jobs question is any color on kind of the hole up as far as getting China up and rolling on the iPhone?\nTim Cook: On \u2013 okay, let me just comment on BRIC in general. We now have of the four BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, we have three of those up and we have 8,000 store counts in those three selling the iPhones and we feel very good about that and we\u2019re putting a lot of energy in growing those. China, we are not in yet. We would like to be in China within the next year and are currently working on that. But I have got nothing specific to announce today on this.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Okay. And on Steve Jobs? I will let Peter make a comment there.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, what is your question?\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Any update regarding Steve Jobs and his return?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We will look forward to Steve returning at the Apple at the end of June.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Great, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Gene. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We will hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit Mac question. Your Mac business was down 8% in the Americas, I presume that the US was potentially worst than that. According to Gartner, the US market was flat this quarter. Though you actually did lose material share and I think as you noted despite the fact that you had a new desktop line up that created a surge in your run rate at the end of the quarter. So I guess given that statement, one, do you care about your market share in the US? And second, given the movement in ASPs that you saw towards the lower end and given your share performance in the US, does that shape or change your thinking about Mac pricing in anyway?\nTim Cook: On \u2013 Toni, it\u2019s Tim. On a worldwide basis, just to make sure we\u2019re in sync with the numbers, IDC projected a \u2013 that the market contracted by 7% worldwide. On a reported basis, we contracted by 3%, but as Peter said in his opening comments on a sell-through basis, we were essentially flat year-over-year. In the US, the US was our weakest, largest geography in terms of comparison year-over-year. But I would remind you that in our US business, a larger percentage of that business is education oriented and therefore subject to the budget constraints that have been significant in many, many other states, actually almost of the states. And so I think that\u2019s one reason why the US is disproportionately affected. And the second is that we saw a less pro Macintoshes being bought in the US on a relative basis to other geographies and we would attribute that also to the economy. There were some mix found there across the world that\u2019s much more so in the US where I think the professional markets have been hit much harder. And so do I care about US share, of course, I do. However, I think cycles come and cycles go. And what we\u2019re about is making the best computers in the world, not making the most, and not getting to a point where we are building products that we are not building products that we are not proud of. And so that first and foremost is our objective and we believe that if we do that over the long-term that we will gain share. We\u2019re \u2013 I am not going to worry about the ebb and flow of each 90 days, because I think that leads you to make a lot of short-term decisions that are not good for the company or for the brand over time.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Tim, could you also comment on your thinking about expanding iPhone adoption. Recently when \u2013 you have said that one area where you are spending a lot of time is thinking about how to increase the adoption of the iPhone and you have been thinking a lot about elasticity. One comment that it struck me was that you were surprised by from your research at the elasticity that you thought was associated with the price of the device. Can you update me on your thinking or what you have learned about iPhone elasticity, now a quarter or later?\nTim Cook: Well, yes, we had a very good quarter in the March quarter. With actually a very small sequential declines for holiday quarter which was far above what our expectations were, so we\u2019re very pleased with how we did. We also announced 3.0 or previewed it developers so that they could begin to change their apps, introduce more apps for the phone, which we believe increases the ecosystem and increases the number of people that want and will buy phone it\u2019s even more. And so we\u2019re very focused on the products side. We\u2019re very focused on the App Store. There we are also focused on geographic rollouts. We spent time this quarter on the Middle East and Asia and rolled up Saudi Arabia, UAE, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand to name a few and we\u2019re obviously focused on more in the future. And so between those the product plans that we\u2019ve got in the App Store and the software that you have seen and then things I can\u2019t talk about, we have a plan that we believe continues to make us the leader in the space, continues to keep us years ahead of others and one of the things that we will make sure is that we don\u2019t leave a price umbrella for people.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: And then finally I guess one for Peter, quickly in response to one of the other questions, you talked about considerations for margins in terms of forces that work to the degree that you can \u2013 can you help give us a bridge in terms of your thinking whether it\u2019s qualitatively or quantitatively about how we think about 36.4% gross margins this quarter to 33% next quarter, can you rank order the forces, can you explain and then rank order the forces in terms of their impact on that expected deceleration?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes on the \u2013 and I will say the larger two out of three are the stronger US dollar and seasonally lower mix driven largely by the beginning the education buying season. Let me talk about each of those. Regarding the dollar, the dollar is all but stronger today than where it was throughout most of the March quarter. But the \u2013 the bigger impact for us on a sequential basis regarding the dollar is our hedges. In our December and March quarter, we had the hedges in place that we\u2019re put in place at the time that the dollar was not as strong and the hedges that we have in place for the June quarter largely we will put in place during March at stronger dollar levels and that\u2019s really what is the \u2013 is really the driving factor behind the sequential impact of the dollar. And of course the ed buying season begins in the June quarter and June tends to be more dominated by K-12s than High Eds. The September quarter historically is stronger for High Eds than for K-12. And K-12 being more of an institutional sale and we expect to be competitive this year especially given the funding situation that tend to strike.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Toni. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next comes from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you very much. I was wondering if you have any information on the percentage of customers that upgraded their iTunes music library now that you\u2019ve launched the DRM free feature. And if you can give us some idea what the revenue from that might have been.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Dave, it\u2019s just been a couple of weeks. So I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s sort of too soon to tell in and I don\u2019t have anything sort of specific on that. The March quarter was very strong for us on the iTunes Store. We saw very, very strong growth in music, video, and of course applications.\nDavid Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs: And then did you say for the September quarter, the margins and gross margin might go down to around 30%, I was just wondering what the reasons you thought it might drop off again would be?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well I am not giving guidance for the September quarter at this point. But in answer to Bill\u2019s question, I said about 34 for the September quarter. We\u2019ll \u2013 we\u2019ll give you more of our thoughts in July on the September quarter.\nDavid Bailey \u2013 Goldman Sachs:\n :\nNancy Paxton: Thanks David. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: The next is Scott Craig with Banc of America.\nScott Craig \u2013 Banc of America: Thanks, good afternoon. Just with regards to cash flow Peter, is there anything in the June quarter that you guys would consider sort of one-timish items that could impact like we saw this quarter? And then I have a follow up.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Let me just kind of quickly go back through what occurred this quarter. So from March to the June quarter, I would not expect the holiday phenomena that we see each year of going from the holiday quarter to the March quarter and necessarily the impact on accounts payable. I don\u2019t have any preface to announce that we\u2019re going to make in the June quarter, so we did make a $500 million repayment in March. And then related to the tax payments, we will make an estimated payment for fiscal \u201909 in the June quarter and then we will make one in the September quarter as well. But I don\u2019t expect to have any of the prior year audit true-ups or to make any more payments on fiscal \u201908, so I don\u2019t expect the tax payments to have the significance in the June quarter that they did in the March quarter.\nScott Craig \u2013 Banc of America: Okay. And then just a follow up on the iPhone for Tim, perhaps, you guys started with Wal-Mart I think towards the end of December last quarter and your sales came in probably higher than most people thought. How much of an impact was Wal-Mart there and then what was the channel inventory in the iPhone as you exited the quarter? That\u2019s it from me. Thanks.\nTim Cook: In terms of Wal-Mart, and as you probably know, they\u2019re a very key partner for us, relative to iPod and we did expand through them for iPhone coverage and we believe they do provide us extended reach in areas that we weren\u2019t heading before. And we\u2019re pleased with the results there thus far, but it\u2019s in the early going and so there is not much to report there yet. In terms of total distribution across the world, we are selling iPhone now in over 50,000 storefronts in the 81 countries, so we have a sizeable presence and sizeable channel in the space. In terms of channel inventory, if you remember last time \u2013 last quarter, I told you that or implied that we had about 1.75 million units in inventory and to remind you in case you guys have forgotten, we are very conservative as to how we count inventory. For example, we count demos that aren\u2019t sellable in inventory and we have about 100,000 of these 50,000 locations. We count units that are in transit from our factories to the carriers that are not physically available for sale and at the end of a quarter, at the end of the last quarter in particular that was around 100,000 units. So just to put your perspective \u2013 to put some context and perspective on now, we also in many cases count inventory all the way to the storefront. I think there are many people in the industry that that count units as sell through and seize to count channel inventory beyond the distribution center, it\u2019s just not the way we look at it. We like to be very disciplined in this environment. So on your specific question, I\u2019m not going to talk about weeks, because we don\u2019t frankly have the experience headed into this quarter about the seasonality given this will be our first June quarter with a \u2013 with a sort of a worldwide spread. But we sold the channel inventory in the countries that we were in at the beginning of the December quarter fall by the end of the quarter. But with the countries that we added which I mentioned before, we added a net of around 80,000 units and so we ended at 1.83 million units. And again that includes all of those categories that I had mentioned earlier. Net-net, we\u2019re very comfortable with the inventory and we have people running more of it.\nScott Craig \u2013 Banc of America: Okay thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Scott. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We will hear from Charles Wolf with Needham.\nCharles Wolf \u2013 Needham: Yes. In view of the explosion in the number of applications for the iPhone and the iTouch, I was wondering what steps Apple is taking to ensure that the iPhone Apps can be discovered? And are these any different from music discovery on the iTunes Store?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Charlie, we are doing a number of things. We include easy to find top 50 and 100 Apps, both paid for and free. We\u2019ve got them associated in various genres as well and we\u2019re expanding those. And so I think the team has done a fantastic job making Apps easy to discover and fun to discover.\nCharles Wolf \u2013 Needham: Are there any kind of unusual patterns in application sales by title versus music sales by title?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Charlie, I would have to say that hitting a billion downloads in about 9 months is every exciting. I think customers are having a lot of fun. I think all of the genres are pretty popular. But of course games and you can see those by the top apps list are a quite popular. And I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why the iPod Touch is an example who has been such a success.\nCharles Wolf \u2013 Needham: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Charlie. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Cross Research, you will hear from Shannon Cross.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Thank you, good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the competitive landscape for smartphones especially as we move closer to the launches of Palm Tree and as well as obviously the iPhone 3.0? And then I have a follow up.\nTim Cook: I think it is difficult to comment on products that aren\u2019t shipping and so I \u2013 there is nothing intelligent I could say on the pre. The iPhone has now sold over 21 million and has the highest overall customer satisfaction of the new order shipping. And so we think that we are in a great position and with the combination of the App Store and affiliates download that should occur tomorrow, we think that we are years ahead. We very much look at this business or see it through the software platform lens and I think that has \u2013 that has benefited us and our customers very well. The breadth of Apps on the store mind boggling from everything from fun things as games to very serious medical kind of applications. And so the power of the device and the ecosystem is enormous and I think we are just scratching the surface now on its opportunity.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Okay, great. And then Peter, we saw your comments on the tape earlier about use of cash, but I figured I would ask the question anyway. Any thoughts on the cash balance, obviously it was not up as much this quarter, but it sounds like given some of the uses of cash. But obviously going forward, there is substantial cash generation. So any thoughts there?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well let me begin by saying for all the right reasons, we are making \u2013 we are working hard to try and be sure that your prediction of entry of cash does occur. But no, nothing new to announce to you today and we continue to be careful with how we\u2019re investing cash and we\u2019re very focused on principal preservations.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: What\u2019s the \u2013 what\u2019s the timing on construction of the new headquarters? Any update there?\nPeter Oppenheimer: No, no update. Things are quite busy here. And well we will begin to focus on that in the future, but no updates today.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Okay, thank you.\nTim Cook: We\u2019re spending all of our energy on constructing new products.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: That\u2019s a good choice.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We will hear from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Your gross margin guidance seemed to \u2013 seems to imply that you expect an unreasonably strong education selling season at least in terms of mix. Was that in consideration and combined with the desktop refresh? Can you help us understand why you expect about a 4.5% sequential revenue decline into the June quarter at its midpoint?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. As we were putting our guidance for the June quarter together, a couple of things. First of all, last year in a much better economy, our Q3 revenue was down 1% sequentially. This year our guidance provides for a couple of more points of \u2013 of sequential decline. Now however it is important to point out that we are guiding for year-over-year growth on a GAAP basis and we would expect our adjusted sales growth to be even higher. But as we think about this year, first, the economy and its continuing impact on consumers and business and the education buying season which we begins this quarter, I discussed earlier that the June quarter is more dominated by K-12 that\u2019s an institution sale and we expect things to be competitive this year given the economy and the funding situations. And we expect some reductions in ASP sequentially as we usually experience in the June quarter. Second, we will not begin to recording revenue on new iPhone sold since our March 17th event. And we will start that when we release the iPhone OS 3.0 software this summer. And finally, I talked a bit about in some of the gross margin discussion the currency environment and we expect the dollars to have an impact not only on gross margin, but of course on our revenue as well largely related to where we got the quarter hedged and the current spot rates.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank: What impact is like software to have on mix in the June quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We don\u2019t give specific product guidance. But in the March quarter, iLife and iWork sales exceeded our expectations and we\u2019re one of the reasons why both revenue and gross margin was higher than we expected.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay. Final question from me is around protecting your IP. Last quarter you talked about rigorously impacting your intellectual property. We haven\u2019t seen any action in the past 90 days, does that say something about either number one, your position, your patent position or number two, the product actually need to ship before you can take action on the IP side? Thanks.\nTim Cook: We think that Apple\u2019s innovation in the iPhone as I said before is leading the industry by years. And we think competition is great, we think it makes all of us better as long as other companies invent their own stock.\nNancy Paxton: Okay, thanks Chris.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, and he will be joined by Apple's COO, Tim Cook, and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler, for the Q&A session with analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes and earnings per share. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecasts. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2008 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC today and the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased to report record results for the December quarter that includes surpassing $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in Apple's history, setting a new record for iPod sales and generating all-time high quarterly earnings. We entered the holiday season with our best product lineup ever and our customers responded. Revenue for the quarter was $10.17 billion, representing 6% growth over the prior December quarter's result and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin for the quarter was better than expected at 20.9% due to higher than anticipated gross margin and strong operating expense management. Net income was $1.6 billion, which translated to earnings per share of $1.78. As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we supplement our analysis of the business internally by using non-GAAP financial measures that correspond to the total sales and product costs of iPhones and Apple TVs sold during the quarter. Our earnings press release provides a full description of these non-GAAP measures, including how we use them, how they are derived and their limitations. In terms of non-GAAP measures, adjusted sales totaled $11.8 billion for the December quarter, which was $1.6 billion higher than our reported revenue. Adjusted gross margin was $4.5 billion, which was $1 billion higher than our reported gross margin, and adjusted net income was $2.3 billion, which was $700 million higher than our reported net income. We continue to believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide added transparency to our business and hope they are helpful to you in your analysis in understanding of our performance during the December quarter. Now turning to the details of our results, I'd like to begin with Mac products and services. For the December quarter, we sold 2.5 million Macs, representing 9% growth over the prior December quarter's results. We are extremely proud of this very solid growth, particularly in contrast to the performance of the rest of the market. In its latest update published last week, IDC estimated that the overall market for personal computers contracted during the December quarter. Customer response to the new MacBook and MacBook Pro introduced in October was very strong, driving year-over-year portables growth of 34% and an overall portable mix of 71%, the highest ever for Apple. Desktop unit sales declined by 25% year-over-year. It's important to remember that in the prior December quarter, desktop sales grew by a phenomenal 53% year-over-year, given the very successful launch of the new iMac in August 2007. In addition to this tough comparison, we believe the year-over-year decline in desktop sales is a reflection of the shift towards portables in the overall market in customer response to our October announcements. IDC's latest published estimate indicates a 16% contraction in global desktop shipments during the December quarter. We are very pleased with overall Mac share gains, and believe our outstanding new features in iLife '09 and iWork '09 introduced earlier this month will distance the Mac experience even farther from the competition. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. Now, I'd like to discuss our music products and services. We sold over 22.7 million iPods, a new quarterly record, representing 3% growth over the previous record sales in the year ago quarter. We were thrilled with customer response to the new iPods introduced in September. Customers love the sleek design and selection of the new Nano, while the superior features of the iPod touch, coupled with the amazing breadth and popularity of content on the App Store have helped establish the iPod Touch as an outstanding gaming, entertainment, communications and information platform. We remain very pleased with iPod market share. Our share of the US market for MP3 players was over 70% in the month of December, based on the latest data published by NPD. And we continue to gain share year-over-year in international markets based on the latest data published by GFK. For the latest period reported, iPod's share of the MP3 market was over 70% in the UK and Australia, over 60% in Japan and over 50% in Canada. We were also pleased with continued year-over-year share gains in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory or a look-forward basis. The iTunes Store had a record quarter had a record quarter; thanks to strong music and video sales and the continued tremendous success of the apps store. We experienced our biggest music quarter ever including our highest sales ever for both Christmas day and Christmas week. We are continuing to change the value proposition for mobile devices with the apps store and developer and customer excitement has been incredible. We now offer over 15,000 applications, an increase of over 10,000 since our last quarterly conference call with many more apps being added each day. We are also thrilled that customer downloads since the July 11 launch had surpassed 500 million. Turning to the iPhone, we sold 4.4 million handsets in the December quarter which brings our cumulative counter 2008 iPhone sales to $13.7 million, well ahead of the 10 million unit goal for the year that we set when we introduced the iPhone. We continue to expand iPhone's geographic reach and we're selling in over 70 countries by the end of the quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales, and carrier payments was $1.25 billion compared to $241 million in the year ago quarter. The sales value of iPhones sold was over $2.6 billion. We're proud of how rapidly iPhone has achieved such remarkably strong traction in the market. Based on its 2008 Business Wireless Smartphone Customer Satisfaction Study, J.D. Power and Associates ranks the iPhone in overall customer satisfaction among business wireless smartphone users, and according to AdMob's December 2008 Mobile Metrics Report, iPhone accounted for 32% of worldwide smartphone ad request in 48% of US smartphone ad request in the month of December, more than RIM, Windows, and Palm combined. It's clear that customers are now attracted to iPhone not only for its amazing functionality and revolutionary multi-touch user interface, but also for its unique ability to let users easily purchase, download, and use thousands of applications ranging from games to social networking to financial planning, and health management and our competitors are scrambling to try and copy our success. The incredible success of the apps store is more evidence of what we have always said that software is the key ingredient for great mobile experience and we continue to believe that we are years ahead of the competition. I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores which hosted a record 46.7 million visitors during the December quarter or 14,400 visitors per store per week. Revenue of $1.74 billion also established a new record and grew 2% year-over-year. Our stores sold 515,000 Macs during the quarter, almost half of which were to customers who have never owned a Mac before. Average revenue per store was $7 million compared to $8.5 million in the prior year and the retail segment margin was $353 million compared to $405 million in the year ago quarter. This reflects the very difficult retail environment in the US where most of our stores are located. In addition, we have expanded Mac distribution with Best Buy over the past year and third-party channels discounted and bundled aggressively this holiday season particularly with iPods to drive profit to their stores. Given the retail conditions around us, our stores performed very well during the December quarter. We ended the quarter with 251 stores, and we now operate retail stores in 10 countries. During the quarter, we opened our first store in Germany in Munich, and it's off to a great start. Our stores achieved the highest ever service volumes as customers came in record numbers for help at our Genius Bars and personal training sessions. Total company gross margin was 34.7% which was above 420 basis points better than our guidance. About half of this difference was due to a more favorable component pricing environment than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The remainder was split fairly between two areas: First, lower than expected transportation, warranty, support, and other costs, and second, favorable adjustments and settlements primarily related to prior quarter supply chain matters. Operating expenses were $1.4billion including $142 million in stock-based compensation expense. Total OpEx was below the low end of our guidance range as a result of lower spending in most areas of the company, particularly in sales, retail and marketing. OI&E was $158 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 29.7%; slightly below guidance, as a result of a onetime benefit from congressional approval of the R&D tax credit which was applied retroactively for January of 2008. Turning to our cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $28.1 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $24.5 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of over $3.6 billion. During the December quarter, we changed our accounting practice for certain fixed income investments to more closely reflect the timing of when those marketable securities will mature. This change resulted in the reclassification of all investments maturing more than one year in the future from short-term marketable securities to long term marketable securities. We have reclassified prior balances to reflect this presentation as well. Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short dated high quality investments and are comfortable with our investment portfolio. Cash flow from operations in the December quarter was over $3.9 billion. Looking ahead to the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We will continue our practice of providing guidance based on GAAP and will report our March quarter non-GAAP financial measures to you in April when we release our results. We are shipping the best products in our history and we remain very confident in our business. Our visibility remains rather low in the current environment, making our forecasting challenging, and we are therefore going to provide a broad range of revenue and earnings guidance for the March quarter. We expect revenue to be between about $7.6 billion and $8 billion. We expect gross margin to be about 32.5%, reflecting approximately $28 million related to stock-based compensation expense compared to 34.7% gross margin in the December quarter. This sequential decline reflects the impact of the stronger US dollar. The favorable supply chain adjustments and settlements from the December quarter are not reoccurring, and the sequentially lower revenue as we have seen in past years. We expect OpEx to be about $1.33 billion, including about $150 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $60 million reflective of the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 31%. We are targeting EPS in the range of about $0.90 to $1. In closing, we are extremely proud of our performance and record results in the December quarter. We are fortunate to have the world's best customers and employees especially in these times. We are continuing to focus on developing the industry's most innovative products, and we are very excited about our new product pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Okay, thanks a lot and nice performance. Well, given that I'm going first, I'll ask how Steve is. I hope he's doing well and I just want to know how you'll run the company differently. With Tim or the same, and if need be, if Tim, do you feel like you would be the likely candidate if the worse case scenario were to happen; were Steve unable to return? Do you feel like you would be the candidate that would steer the helm here?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, it's Peter. Steve is the CEO of Apple and plans to remain involved in major strategic decisions and Tim will be responsible for our day-to-day operations.\nTim Cook: Ben, let me add something to that and backup just a bit. There is extraordinary breadth and depth and tenure among the Apple executive team, and they lead 35,000 employees that I would call wicked smart - and that's in all areas of the company from engineering to marketing to operations and sales and all the rest. And the values of our company are extremely well entrenched. We believe that we are on the face of the earth to make great products and that's not changing. We are constantly focusing on innovating. We believe in the simple not the complex. We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make, and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution. We believe in saying no to thousands of projects, so that we can really focus on the few that are truly important and meaningful to us. We believe in deep collaboration and cross-pollination of our groups, which allow us to innovate in a way that others cannot. And frankly, we don't settle for anything less than excellence in every group in the company, and we have the self-honesty to admit when we're wrong and the courage to change. And I think regardless of who is in what job those values are so embedded in this company that Apple will do extremely well. And I would just reiterate a point Peter made in his opening comments that I strongly believe that Apple is doing the best work in its history.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Thanks a lot, Tim. And I wanted to wish you all the best and Steve as well. The last question for me is just a little more on retail. Could you guys with the flat performance sequentially and what's going on in the environment, are you guys planning to scale down your expansion? And is there anything we should be concerned about long term if retail slows any impact on margin, maybe with regard to capacity utilization or utilization of your properties? Anything you're thinking about there in this type of slower environment?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, we plan to open about 25 stores in fiscal 2009, about half of those will come internationally. And Ron and his team are continuing to be very selective with real estate and won't take a bad site. Our stores are amazingly productive and are providing outstanding service to our customers. I went through some of that in my prepared remarks. The environment around us was a bit tough, but the stores performed very, very well. We are very confident in our stores and the asset that we are building.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Thanks a lot. I'll cede the floor.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Ben. Could we have next question please?\nOperator: And that will come from Bill Shope with Credit Suisse.\nBill Shope - Credit Suisse: Okay, thanks. Peter, in the past you've noted that in Apple's experience at least the iPod segment is fairly price elastic, but the Mac segment is fairly inelastic. Now, that you've had several quarters of iPhone data, could you help us understand whether or not you characterize this segment as elastic or inelastic, and if it is elastic, do you think handset price reductions would eventually make sense in this environment to spur unit demand?\nTim Cook: Bill, it's Tim. This segment is clearly elastic. And you can see that over the course of the time that we have been selling iPhone, you've seen the price. And I'll just talk to the US market for a moment to make this simple. It moved from $599 to $399. We saw a tremendous jump in the run rate. And then as we went from $399 to $199 and introduced the iPhone 3G, we saw another significant jump in the run rate. So there's clearly a price elasticity in this market. We believe that the $199 level. And this includes signing up for contract obviously that this is a compelling value and we see nothing in the marketplace anywhere close to it. We still believe that we're years ahead of the competition from a software point of view. And when you throw in the Applications Store with the statistics that Peter pointed earlier with over 15,000 Apps and over half a billion downloads in a very, very short period of time, we feel very, very good about our competitive position.\nBill Shope - Credit Suisse: Okay. And then a quick question on the gross margin line. Given the gross margin upside and the guidance of the gross margins and the March quarter, I'm assuming it's not still reasonable to assume gross margins will average out at 30% for fiscal 2009, as it did a few quarters ago, is that true?\nTim Cook: Well, we reported our December quarter and I've given you our guidance for the March quarter. But as I look forward, I would see our gross margins being about 30% in the second half of the fiscal 2009. Our guidance in the March quarter of 32.5 is benefiting from a very favorable commodity environment and thanks to our hedging program, we've not seen the full impact of the US dollar strengthening, which began in August of last year. We continue to anticipate gross margins, as I said, about 30 in the second half. Considering the commodity environment and the stronger dollar, we are also continuing to focus on delivering state-of-the-art products at price points our competitors can't match. We want to provide increasing value to our customers and we are not going to leave any pricing umbrellas.\nBill Shope - Credit Suisse: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Bill. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: And the next question from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Okay, thank you. Peter, I guess one for you and then one for Tim. First of all, you mentioned that you were giving a wider range than normal for guidance for the March quarter. However, the range is considerably narrower than the one that you provided for the December quarter. And I realize that you're building up a base of recurring revenue with the iPhone. Is that the only factor that leads you to give a more narrow range for the March quarter? Or is there something else that's giving you confidence in the business going into March, which is traditionally a tougher quarter for consumer companies?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Our models are not as precise as they have been. And our visibility really isn't as good as it had been in the past. And in prior quarters Rich, we had really given more of a single point estimate for the top line. As you know, and as you said in the December quarter, we gave $1 billion range for revenue. But it was a much bigger quarter with a much higher level of sales expected to occur, and actually did occur in the last weeks of the quarter. But I would consider a $400 million range pretty wide for us. Yes, we do have recurring parts of our business. And so we are shipping the best products that we ever have as a company. So that gives us some confidence as well.\nTim Cook: Rich, I would just add that if you think back to the timing of the guidance, we were in a period of time where banks were going down, what seemed like every other day and it does seem like where things, where the economy is clearly in bad shape that it is not as unpredictable as it was in October perhaps.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Okay. And then as a follow-up for you Tim. You typically give us an update on the component pricing environment from quarter-to-quarter. We've seen some pretty dramatic increases at least in spot prices for things like DRAM, NAND, and flat panels here recently. And I'm wondering if you can remind us what you do to mitigate the impact of that on your cost of goods, given that you tend to adjust prices less frequently than some of your PC competition?\nTim Cook: Maybe I should talk about what I think will occur in the quarter and what occurred last quarter. Last quarter was incredibly favorable. Peter said that it was a key factor in the reason our gross margin beat our guidance. We saw several commodities do much better than we thought like DRAM and NAND Flash and LCDs and we saw frankly some commodities selling at or near variable costs and we think further reductions from those levels are just not likely. We do, however, in the aggregate, expect a continued favorable environment, on both supply and price this quarter, for NAND, for DRAM, for LCD, and for drives, and for most other commodities. And so, I think when you look at it in the aggregate, it will still be positive, but the falls from where we were are not going to be like they were in the Q1 time frame.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Okay. And Rich I would caution you to remember that there's a difference between the spot markets and the contract markets.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup: Okay, all right. Thank you, Tim.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon and congratulations. If you talk about the pricing environment to the pricing umbrella on the iPhone, if you look at your addressable markets and almost billion subs that you currently address, about 60% of those markets are non-contractual markets. Are those markets that you're potentially interested in and how should we think about your addressable market, if they're a market that you're basically priced too high for?\nTim Cook: Gene, it's Tim. We are now in over 70 countries in the iPhone and you're correct. Some of those countries are non-subsidized markets. Examples of that are -- the largest example of that would be India in terms of the size of the market that we're currently in and they are like that and our sales are clearly materially less in those markets than they are in the subsidized markets that have post pay contracts. And so, we're constantly evaluating the best way to play in these markets. We know that there's a huge market opportunity there, and we'll make adjustments in the future accordingly to play in a stronger way.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. So when you talk about no pricing umbrella, you're referring more towards the subsidized markets versus non-subsidized.\nTim Cook: Yeah. That clearly, and you know us. We're not going to play in the low end voice song business. That's not who we are. It's not why we're here. We'll let somebody else do that. Our objective is not to be the unit share leader in the cell phone industry. It's to build the world's best phones.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. And second, obviously the strength again came from portables and Macs and if you're going to look at the overall industry growth, there's some evidence that that kind of a sub $500 netbooks are starting to gain share and grow little bit more quickly, which obviously impacts to your overall market share. How should we think about or how do you think about that kind of that sub $500 market?\nTim Cook: We're watching that space. But, right now from our point of view the products in there are principally based on hardware that's much less powerful than we think customers want. Software technology that is not good, cramped keyboards small displays... And so, we don't think that people are going to be pleased with those types of products. But we'll see. We are watching the space, as you know about 3% of the industry or the PC industry last year was in this netbook kind of category. And so, it's a category we watch. We've got some ideas here. But, right now we think the products there are inferior and will not provide an experience to customers that they're happy with.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, one last very quick question in terms of Apple TV. Is there any seasonality that you typically see a little bit of an uptick as any seasonality develops in that business?\nTim Cook : There was a tremendous pickup year-over-year. In fact Apple TV unit sales were up almost three times versus the year ago quarter. However, let me be clear. We still consider this a hobby. It is clear that the movie rental business has really helped Apple TV and there are more and more customers that want to try it. And we're going to continue to invest in it, because we fundamentally believe there is something there for us in the future.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Great thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Gene. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From FTN Midwest we hear from Bill Fearnley.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Yes. Thank you. If I could ask a question on the desktops in the Pro segment. In the Pro segment, how does that affect the Mac numbers and the desktop numbers? Any update on the Pro segment on the audio and video side and then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: The Mac Pro percentage of our desktop business is not large. Our desktop number is primarily iMac. But, to answer your question specifically that the Pro segment was down year-over-year as you might expect because small businesses are cutting back on expenditures in this current economic climate.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Any update? Switching to another end user market is important. And any update on the education market when there is a lot of chatter about what's happening with state budgets and you folks certainly didn't do a lot here in the last quarter in education. But do you start getting a sense of what you might be looking at for the calendar 2009? Any update to the education market here?\nTim Cook: Yes sure. If you look at our results last quarter, we were down 6% year-over-year in total and if you look at the K-12 component of that which is more sensitive to the state budgets, K-12 was down 10% year-over-year. There's very significant funding uncertainty in this environment and as you mentioned state budget shortfalls are almost everywhere. In fact, in the data that we're collecting 39 out of the 50 states have some form of shortfall. And so, K-12 was weak. In the previous quarter in Q4 it was weak again last quarter. We don't forecast individual markets but I don't see this picking up very quickly until there's a huge infrastructure outlay and hopefully now with a new President we may get some of that underway.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: And, if I could switch gears and just get a product update from you as well. Any additional thoughts here on Snow Leopard? You've talked about it in the past. Any updates there on what you might have for a timeline? And if you're not prepared to give a timeline, any thoughts on progress in the development versus your expectations there?\nTim Cook: No comments to share today. Yeah, we're very excited about the next release, but we do not have a specific launch date to announce today.\nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: Thanks guys.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Bill. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Yes, thank you. I have a couple of questions please. Peter on the last call you had stated that iPhone channel inventory was 2 million units. Can you provide an update on that inventory level please?\nTim Cook: Tony, hi, it's Tim. Actually, I think I said last time that we did have a channel build in the previous quarter as you mentioned in the launch quarter of iPhone 3G. It was approximately 2 million units. In Q1, despite launching in 20 or so additional countries and some additional channels within countries that we had previously launched, we ended the quarter with sequentially lower channel inventories. The level that we're at we're very comfortable with. And I think you have to obviously take the changes in channel inventories in both quarters into consideration in looking at sequentially the sell through.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Can you help dimension? How significant was that change or can you help us think through in terms of weeks of inventory? If there was a modest draw down in channel inventory, it may or may not suggest that you're above your targeted range for other products of four to six weeks. Can you help dimension? Specifically, how big was the drawdown in channel inventory?\nTim Cook: Sure. I'll be specific. The draw down was about a quarter of a million. In terms of your question on weeks, that I can't be specific about because we were in 70 countries for the first time last quarter. This is the first time with that many countries that we're moving from a December quarter to a March quarter and so frankly we're uncertain as exactly the seasonal pattern of demand, as we move from quarter to quarter. But, based on the information we've gotten from our carrier partners, we feel very comfortable with our inventory level.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you that's helpful. Can I switch to another topic? Can you comment on relative strength in the iPod business domestic versus internationally? I think relative to investor expectations, iPod numbers were better than expected in part given some of the data points that emerged during the quarter about US iPod sales. Can you comment on relative growth rates of the iPod business in the US versus international? And can you comment on linearity of growth in the iPod business over the course of the quarter?\nTim Cook: Yeah. In terms of geography Toni, if you look at the US, the iPod sales contracted at the unit level about 3% year-over-year. So all of the growth that you -- that you see in our number -- that 22.7 was all international. If you look at the linearity at a worldwide level, it would look very similar for each of the weeks until you get to the last week of the quarter. We saw a rush of buying the last week of the quarter. Specifically, all of our growth occurred in the last week of the quarter. We attribute that to the macroeconomic environment and its effect on consumer buying behavior.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Okay. And then, finally can you help us understand. If you think about your gross margins on a year-over-year basis, what kind of impact mix had on gross margins? Clearly we had some visibility from last quarter that the iPhone margins are substantially higher than the company average. That pushes up gross margins. Can you help us understand given that there were some difference in revenue growth rate across all three products this year, this quarter, and what the mix impact from each product was on the margins in a year-over-year basis?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Toni, as I told you before, we don't talk a lot about year-over-year gross margin changes because there's a lot of moving parts. I think it's more straightforward for us to talk about it sequentially. As you look back this year versus last, we have a very different currency situation for example and a different commodity situation. And you know that gross margins were literally flat in percent terms year-over-year. That's all I can say.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. The first one, Peter, how are you thinking about operating expense? I mean, you gave us the coming quarter's numbers, but just as it relates to revenue growth, is there anything you can talk about because you discussed on the call being a bit more conservative in how you're looking at operating expense? So any thoughts you can give us would be helpful.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Shannon, we're very confident in our strategy, in our business. We're going to invest our way through this downturn just as we did the last one. We certainly saw the benefits of innovative products and quality points of sale as the economy improved the last time around. So we're continuing to invest in such areas as engineering, marketing, the customer experience to bring the industry's most innovative products to market and delight our customers.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay. Given the discussions on currency, can you walk us a little bit through the impact of currency on your P&L? I mean, top-line we can understand, but in terms of sourcing and sort of how we should think about it from a COGS and SG&A standpoint.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. We do have a hedging program. Our European hedges are recorded to revenue and our Asian and Canadian hedges tend to record to COGS. We do have local expenses, but they're not the biggest part of our business that can help in a changing currency environment. The operations team also has the opportunity to have conversations with suppliers as currency rate moves in. As we introduce new products, we will think about changes and local pricing. That's how we manage it.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay. And then, my final question is just on cash. Could you just discuss any thoughts on the use of cash? Obviously $26 billion is a pretty healthy war chest.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, not to make my answer any more difficult, but I am proud to tell you that we're over $28 billion at this point. And that's for all the right reasons; just very strong performance in the business. But there is no new update from what we shared with you last quarter.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And from UBS, we'll hear from Maynard Um.\nMaynard Um - UBS: Hi. Thank you. Can you just speak to the linearity of your guidance? Obviously you have three weeks under your belt here. What in particular does the guidance assume in the remaining two months?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We're not going to give you an update on this quarter. We've provided our guidance for the March quarter. In this environment, I'm thrilled to be providing guidance that has growth year-over-year. And again, we're shipping the best products that we have ever shipped, and thankfully, customers are responding.\nMaynard Um - UBS: Okay. You spoke of some uncertainty about the potential iPhone seasonality, but I presume you have visibility because of the order lead times from operators. Given iPhone 3G is still kind of in its early days and you had some inventory drawdown, do you think you can buck the seasonal downtick that you typically see in the handset industry and see a sequential uptick in units?\nTim Cook: We don't forecast that at a product level. We obviously do internally, but we don't externally, in terms of our guidance. But the fear that we would have and I think that everyone has in this market, is that the economy may slow the adoption rate of smartphones, because generally smartphones generally command higher monthly fees and that may keep some customers to not signing up for higher contracts. But we will see. We feel very good about our competitive position as I said before and extremely good about our product pipeline.\nMaynard Um - UBS: Okay. Great, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Maynard. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will come from David Bailey with Goldman Sachs.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Okay, thank you very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pluses and minuses of adding Wal-Mart as a reseller of iPhone and what's different about Wal-Mart versus Best Buy or your own stores as far as mix and activation capability?\nTim Cook: David, it's Tim. We just started working with Wal-Mart on iPhone at the very end of December, and so we have not enough data to draw any conclusion about performance. From a reach point of view, what Wal-Mart does is reach a tremendous amount more people than we could reach in our stores. Obviously, they have over 4,000 or so storefronts and they are in areas of the country that we have no Apple stores and so they provide a level of reach beyond of what we would provide ourselves or beyond what AT&T stores would provide. And so that's the reason we're there. As you know, we also sell iPods in Wal-Mart and have a good relationship with them and have seen what they can do in that space and it was with that data and knowledge that we entered into this relationship with iPhone.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Thank you. And then you commented a little bit about the linearity on the iPod side; could you talk about linearity on Macs and iPhone in the December quarter?\nTim Cook: Yeah, sure. Macs sales were the second highest in our history as Peter alluded to earlier and only surpassed by just 3% from the previous quarter which had a materially better macroeconomic landscape than we did last quarter. As you might guess, when we announced our portables, sell-through accelerated tremendously in October and the team here did an excellent job on the production ramp and therefore we were able to quickly serve those customers and so the October year-over-year data on the Mac is very good, and the portables all quarter as a matter of fact led to this which is a pretty stunning number a 34% year-over-year unit increase on portables for the whole quarter despite the tough environment. International versus the US, international on Mac was much stronger than the US. The US growth on the Macintosh was 2%. The international growth was 16% year-over-year and we saw several countries that were about 20 like Canada and Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, Italy several countries over 20. So, the linearity itself strong in October after the portable announcements, weak before and I had mentioned that on the last call I believe that we felt that people were delaying purchases on rumors of the new portables and then for the balance of the quarter we saw again a spike at the end of the quarter which I think was not as strong as iPod but something that was created by the economic environment and the consumer behavior reaction to it. On the iPhone, we have little history here to compare to and so it's difficult to say how we performed versus what it was supposed to be like. We saw a very strong ending of the quarter on iPhone, but in terms of during, I really can't make an educated comment on it given that it's just our second December in the business. Our first December in it, a large wide rolled out through many countries.\nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks a lot, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, David. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From JPMorgan, we'll hear from Mark Moskowitz.\nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Thank you, good afternoon. This question is probably more for Ron, but I'll ask it anyway. If you, Peter, and then Tim, as far as the retail stores, can you give us any sort of context around the same-store sales philosophy in international versus US in the past year and the kinds of follow-up on the multiplier effect if you will, when you open up these new stores internationally in the past year, are you seeing that pull through not only in the retail but also online and through some of your third-party folks in those regions where you're opening those stores?\nPeter Oppenheimer: The retail performance outside the US was a bit stronger, and similar to what we saw in other parts of the business. And as Tim just alluded to in David's question, we think that our retail stores are helping us in each of our geographies. They are a great place for new customers, particularly those that are new to the Mac to come and experience our products, understand them and some people choose to buy in our stores and some people may buy elsewhere. We're fine with either. We just want to be sure that the Macs and the iPhones, in particular, have a great point of sale for new customers to come and experience them. And that's why we're opening the stores. As I said a few minutes ago, we plan to open about 25 in fiscal 2009, and about half of them will be international.\nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Okay. And then, the second question you mentioned earlier about the third-party discount theme you took at Best Buy and others. How have you seen those dynamics kind of play out in the last three weeks or so and how are you mitigating those risks?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, I'm not sure there's much to mitigate per se. I mean, the resellers are able to do what they want. Some here in the US, as an example, over the December quarter certainly did do some promotional activities, particularly with iPods, where they may have attached a gift card to it. If that's something they're doing and if they want to do it, it's fine. I've not observed much of that post the holiday as we saw prior to the holiday.\nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Bank of Montreal, we have Keith Bachman.\nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Hi, guys. I had two margin questions. You alluded to or mentioned that there was a supply chain adjustment to gross margins in the December quarter, and I think you said it was going to reoccur in the March quarter. Could you describe what it is and how much it was? And then, I have a follow-up question, please.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Keith, we exceeded our gross margin guidance in the December quarter by about 420 basis points. In the range of a quarter of that were some favorable adjustments and settlements, primarily related to prior quarter items we had in the supply chain. I don't expect those to reoccur in the March quarter, and that's one of the three primary reasons why I see the gross margin declining sequentially from the December to the March quarter.\nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay. Peter, my follow-up question, on the non-GAAP adjustments you provided a schedule this quarter as you did last quarter. The implied or stated gross margin increased substantially. It was about 61% this quarter versus 49% last quarter. What's the reason that gross margins increased so substantially in the non-GAAP adjustments?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. As we explained last quarter, the adjustment column reflects two things. The first is the reversal of the iPhone revenue and product costs recognized during the quarter.\nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Right.\nPeter Oppenheimer: And then the addition of sales value and product costs to the iPhones and Apple TVs sold in the quarter. 61% is just simply the mathematical result of these adjustments, the in and the out to revenue and cost of goods sold. The sales value of the iPhones sold and added in during the quarter was $2.6 billion, and that was much larger than the recognized revenue of $1 billion that was backed out. So, it's really just that overweighting that you saw last quarter. However, on a sequential basis, the iPhone 3G gross margin was higher in the December quarter, and this was a result of lower product costs partially offset by a stronger dollar. But it was less than 61% in terms of its gross margin, just like it was less than the 48 last quarter.\nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Keith. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll hear from Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Yeah. Thanks very much. Maybe shifting to the iPhone. There's now a number of competitors coming to the market, many who will have their own sort of variance on the sort of, say, customer experience that iPhone was famous for initiating, and that includes things like Android and Windows and the Palm Pre. I was just wondering, beyond what's obviously been a powerful leadership in applications, how do you think about sustaining that leadership and brand in the face of these competitive developments in this sector going forward?\nTim Cook: Mike hi, its Tim. I would say first of all, it's difficult to judge products that are not yet in the market. But the iPhone has sold over 17 million units thus far. It's received the highest overall customer satisfaction of products from many different surveys. And, we've said since the beginning software is the key ingredient and we believe that we're still years ahead on software. And I would include in that software umbrella, the Applications Store, and you can see the explosion that has happened in applications with over half a billion downloads. If you look at others, I think when you think about having multiple variations of displays, multiple variations of resolutions and input methods, and many different forms of hardware, it's a big challenge to a software developer and is not very enticing for them to build a different App for every one of these things. But, we shall see what people will do. We approach this business as a software platform business, and so I think we approach it fundamentally different than people that are approaching it only from a hardware point of view. And so, as I've said before, we're very, very confident with where we are competitively. We are watching the landscape. We like competition. As long as they don't rip off our IP and if they do we're going to go after anybody that does.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: That was actually my next question because,\nTim Cook: I thought it might be. And that's the reason I want to go ahead and get that out.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Because, it seems until Palm came out, many of the other players had in fact negotiated carefully around your multi-touch IP; whereas, the Palm device particularly seems to almost directly emulate the kind of touch interfaces that you had innovated and that Steve, when he launched the phone, talked about patented. Is that to what you're referring with regarding to ripping off IP?\nTim Cook: I don't want to talk about any specific company. I'm just making a general statement that we think competition is good. It makes us all better. And we are ready to suit up and go against anyone. However, we will not stand for having our IP ripped off, and we'll use whatever weapons that we have at our disposal. I don't know that I can be clearer than that.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: And lastly, I realize you do have a transition to laptops but given that quarter-over-quarter Macs were down 3%, and amidst a launch of new Macs, can you give us a sense of what you're thinking about either regarding your guidance or just generally on Mac trends going forward?\nTim Cook: If you look at the Mac and the slight decline sequentially and you think about the macroeconomic environment from fiscal Q4 to fiscal Q1, I think it's a fantastic result, so I'm thrilled with it. I'll remind you we grew 9% on a sell-in basis and we did take down the channel inventory some in addition to that. And the market as projected by IDC, IDC has said that the worldwide market actually contracted. So, you're comparing 9% to a negative number. So, I feel very, very good about that. If you look at our unit share in retail in the US, in December it was over 16. If you look at the revenue share it was over 32 and Apple was number 1 in revenue share in retail in the US. I think those are all fantastic results and we're extremely proud of them.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you Mike. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Needham & Company, we'll hear from Charles Wolf.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Yes, I have a couple of questions. On the Apple stores, what was the average number of stores open during the quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Hold on Charlie. 249.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Okay. And how many one-on-one sessions did you have during the quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I don't have that in front of me and I'm sorry. But, we did set a record as I said in my prepared remarks for one-to-one sessions in the quarter.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: And my last question. There's been, I believe, 500 million downloads from the App store. I'm curious what percentage were paid and what percentage were free?\nPeter Oppenheimer: That's something, Charlie, that we're not disclosing. But, we are thrilled with the App store. You know, it was a pleasure last week to be able to say that we surpassed 500,000. And, it's huge to say that there's more than 15000 Apps now on the store, which I would point out is again up more than 10000 since we last talked to you on this conference call.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Yes. And, with respect to the App store, are you going to continue to report revenues within iTunes or are you going to separate that out at some point in the future?\nPeter Oppenheimer: At this point, it's part of iTunes and no plans to make a change at this point.\nCharles Wolf - Needham & Company: Okay. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Charlie. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store. There is a webcast on apple.com/investor and by telephone and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and the confirmation code is 4939950.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're extremely pleased to report the conclusion of a great fiscal year for Apple with outstanding results for the September quarter. Our innovative product lineup is the best ever and customer response has been tremendous. As a result, we set new all-time records for Mac, iPhone and iPad sales in the September quarter, and we are thrilled to report the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history. Revenue for the quarter was $20.34 billion, an increase of more than $8.1 billion over the prior September quarter's result, representing growth of 67%. The very strong growth was fueled primarily by record iPhone sales, the tremendous popularity of iPad and our best Mac quarter ever. Operating margin was $5.45 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was $4.31 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings record by $930 million and represented 70% growth over the year-ago quarter's earnings. These results translated to earnings per share of $4.64. Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We set a new quarterly record with sales of almost 3.9 million Macs, exceeding the previous record established in the June quarter by over 400,000. This represents 27% year-over-year growth, more than double IDC's latest published estimate of 11% growth for the market overall in the September quarter. We experienced strong double-digit growth in both Mac desktop and portable categories led by very strong sales of iMac which was updated in July and the continued popularity of the MacBook Pro and MacBook. Mac growth was strong in each of our geographic segments, led by Asia-Pacific at 56% year-over-year and Japan at 49%. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. Moving to our music products, we sold nearly 9.1 million iPods compared to 10.2 million in the year-ago quarter. In September, we announced a great new lineup of iPods for the holiday season, including our redesigned iPod Shuffle featuring clickable buttons, the reinvented iPod Nano with multi-touch and the new iPod touch with Retina display and FaceTime video calling. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. iPod also continues to be the top selling MP3 player and gained share internationally year-over-year in most of the countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We remain within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-back basis. The iTunes Store also had another strong quarter with revenue over $1 billion. In September, we launched iTunes 10, including a number of new features such as $0.99 TV rentals, AirPlay wireless music playback and Ping, which offers social music discovery to millions of iTunes users in 23 countries. We also introduced new Apple TV which provides a simple way to watch movies and TV shows on your HDTV for the breakthrough price of just $99. I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were extremely pleased to have sold 14.1 million iPhones compared to just under 7.4 million in the previous September quarter. This represents 91% year-over-year growth and is well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smart phone market overall in the September quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessories sales was $8.82 billion during the quarter compared with $4.61 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 92%. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $8.6 billion which yields an ASP of about $610. At the end of the September quarter, we had iPhone distribution through 166 carriers in 89 countries. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth, particularly in Asia, Europe and Japan where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. We were very happy to be shipping iPhone 4 in China as of the last day of the September quarter, and we've been very pleased with the customer response to date. Last month, J.D. Power and Associates announced that for the fourth consecutive time, Apple ranks highest in its survey of customer satisfaction among manufacturers of smart phones, citing particularly strong performance and ease of operation, operating system, features and physical design. Adoption of iPhone within the enterprise continues to accelerate. In fact, since we've shipped iPhone 4, we've seen extraordinary growth from 60% to more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies deploying or piloting iPhone. Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device list worldwide. Most recently, Fortune 500 companies like Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Pfizer, Allstate, and Cardinal Health and Global 500 accounts such as Aviva Group, Total, Novartis, Roche and Sanofi-Aventis have made iPhone available to their employees. We ended the quarter with about 3.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 825,000 to support the launch of iPhone 4. We continue to have a sizeable backlog and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to supply them. Turning to iPad, we're thrilled with its momentum. In just the second quarter of availability, we sold almost 4.2 million iPads with distribution in 26 countries by the end of the September quarter. We're seeing great enthusiasm for iPad from consumers, educators and businesses. Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved device list at an impressive rate. Since the launch of iPad, over 65% of the Fortune 100 is already deploying or piloting iPad. Some recent examples of companies approving iPad include, Procter & Gamble, Lowes, Hyatt, NBC Universal and Novartis. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $2.8 billion. The sales value of iPads alone was about $2.7 billion, which yields an ASP of about $645. We were able to increase the supply of iPads over the course of the quarter, building channel inventory by about 500,000 units to end the quarter with between three and four weeks of channel inventory below our target range of four to six weeks. We are expanding U.S. iPad distribution to include Wal-Mart, Target, Verizon and AT&T stores. We are also expanding distribution internationally. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed cumulative iOS device sales by 125 million last month. During the September quarter, we released iOS 4.1, which builds on the innovations of iOS 4 bringing FaceTime video calling, multi-tasking, folders and Game Center to iPod Touch in addition to iPhone customers. And in November, we plan to release iOS 4.2 which will bring many of the great new features of iOS 4 to iPad. iOS 4.2 will also include AirPrint, Apple's new printing architecture that automatically finds printers on local networks and enables printing from iOS devices over Wi-Fi without the need to install drivers or download software. The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success. There are now over 200,000 registered iOS developers who continue to bring outstanding and creative new apps to the iOS platform, including over 65,000 game and entertainment titles and over 30,000 apps designed specifically for iPad. And we launched iAd in July, which provides marketers with the ability to place interactive ads in popular apps for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. We were very happy with results so far. Customers are loving the media-rich ads and marketers are very pleased with viewer engagement. I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which had a record-breaking quarter. Retail revenue was $3.57 billion compared to $2.04 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 75%. Our stores sold a record 874,000 Macs compared to 670,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 30%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened 24 stores during the September quarter, 16 of which were outside the United States, including spectacular stores in Beijing, Shanghai, London and Paris. Our new Beijing and Shanghai stores opened on the last day of the quarter, and first-day sales from both stores exceeded all previous store openings. Our four China stores are our highest traffic stores in the world and are among our highest performing. We also entered our eleventh country, with the opening of stores in Barcelona and Madrid. That brings us to a total of 317 stores worldwide as at the end of the quarter, with 84 of them outside the United States. With an average of 301 stores opened during the September quarter, average revenue per store was $11.8 million compared to $7.8 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 52%. Retail segment margin was $917 million compared to $564 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 74.5 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 45.9 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 62%. As we look ahead to fiscal 2011, we see great opportunity to continue our retail growth with our focus on international expansion. In total, we expect to open 40 to 50 stores in our fiscal 2011 with over 50% of them outside the United States. We will also begin replacing several stores in the United States to get them right-sized for Apple's current product line and to meet our service goals. Total company gross margin was 36.9%, which was 190 basis points above our guidance. About two-thirds of this favorability was driven by lower commodity and other costs, and the remainder was mostly attributable to a better-than-planned mix of iPhone sales. Operating expenses were $2.07 billion and included $185 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $14 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 21%, about five points below our guidance, largely a result of two factors. First, we had a higher mix of foreign earnings than we planned. Second, we had some discrete one-time tax benefits in the quarter as well. Our tax rate for fiscal 2010 was about 24.5%. Turning to cash, our cash flow short term and long term marketable securities totaled $51 billion at the end of the September quarter compared to $45.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, an increase of $5.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $5.7 billion. The September quarter was the culmination of a monumental year for Apple. In fiscal 2010, we launched several new Macs; establishing record sales of over $13.6 million and achieving 31% year-over-year sales growth, significantly outpacing the growth of the overall pc market. We introduced the tremendously popular iPhone 4 with breakthrough features including FaceTime and Retina display fueling full-year sales of 40 million iPhones, an increase of 93% over fiscal 2009. We launched the groundbreaking iPad, selling nearly 7.5 million to delighted customers in two quarters alone. We also brought great new features to iOS and iTunes, and continue to innovate with completely new designs for iPod. And as a result, we generated record revenue of over $65 billion, an increase of over $22 billion year-over-year or 52%. Earnings of $14 billion grew even faster at 70% year-over-year. To put this growth in a perspective, in fiscal 2010, Apple generated almost five times the revenue and more than 10 times the earnings it did just five years earlier in fiscal 2005. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $23 billion compared to $15.7 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margins to be about 36% reflecting approximately $52 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.325 billion including about $250 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $65 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We're targeting EPS of about $4.80. In closing, we're thrilled with our record September quarter and fiscal year 2010 results. We're very enthusiastic about our innovative product line-up and our significant opportunities for growth as we head into fiscal 2011. And we remain extremely confident in our new product pipeline. Before taking your questions, I would like to turn the call over to our CEO, Steve Jobs.\nSteve Jobs: As most of you know, I don't usually participate in Apple's earnings calls since you are all in such capable hands with Peter and Tim. But I just couldn't help dropping by for our first $20 billion quarter. I would like to chat about a few things and then stay for the rest of the Q&A if that's alright. First, let me discuss iPhone. We sold 14.1 million iPhones in the quarter which represents a 91% unit growth over the year-ago quarter and was well ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 64% growth for the global smartphone market in the September quarter. And it handily beat RIM's 12.1 million Blackberry's sold in their most recent quarter ending in August. We've now passed RIM, and I don't seem them catching up with us in the foreseeable future. They must move beyond their area of strength and comfort into the unfamiliar territory of trying to become a software platform company. I think it's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform after iOS and Android. With 300,000 apps on Apple's App Store, RIM has a high mountain ahead of them to climb. Well, what about Google? Last week, Eric Schmidt reiterated that they are activating 200,000 Android devices per day. And have around 90,000 apps in their App Store. For comparison, Apple has activated around 275,000 iOS devices per day on average for the past 30 days with a peak of almost 300,000 iOS devices per day on a few of those days. And Apple has 300,000 apps on its App Store. Unfortunately, there is no solid data on how many Android phones are shipped each quarter. We hope that manufacturers will soon start reporting the number of Android handsets they ship each quarter. But today that just isn't the case. Gartner reported that around 10 million Android phones were shipped in the June quarter and we await to see if iPhone or Android was the winner in this most recent quarter. Google loves to characterize Android as open, and iOS and iPhone as closed. We find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the real difference between our two approaches. The first thing most of us think about when we hear the work open is Windows which is available on a variety of devices. Unlike Windows, however, where most pc's have the same user interface and run the same app, Android is very fragmented. Many Android OEMs, including the two largest, HTC and Motorola install proprietary user interfaces to differentiate themselves from the commodity Android experience. The users will have to figure it all out. Compare this with iPhone, where every handset works the same. Twitter client, Twitter Deck, recently launched their app for Android. They reported that they had to contend with more than 100 different versions of Android software on 244 different handsets. The multiple hardware and software iterations present developers with a daunting challenge. Many Android apps work only on selected Android handsets running selected Android versions. And this is for handsets that have been shipped less than 12 months ago. Compare this with iPhone, where there are two versions of the software, the current and the most recent predecessor to test against. In addition to Google's own app marketplace, Amazon, Verizon and Vodafone have all announced that they are creating their own app stores for Android. So there will be at least four app stores on Android, which customers must search among to find the app they want and developers will need to work with to distribute their apps and get paid. This is going to be a mess for both users and developers. Contrast this with Apple's integrated App Store, which offers users the easiest-to-use largest app store in the world, preloaded on every iPhone. Apple's App Store has over three times as many apps as Google's marketplace and offers developers' one-stop shopping to get their apps to market easily and to get paid swiftly. Even if Google were right, and the real issue is closed versus open, it is worthwhile to remember that open systems don't always win. Take Microsoft's PlaysForSure music strategy, which use the PC model, which Android uses as well, of separating the software components from the hardware components. Even Microsoft finally abandoned this open strategy in favor of copying Apple's integrated approach with their Zoom Player, unfortunately leaving their OEMs empty-handed in the process. Google flirted with this integrated approach with their Nexus One phone. In reality, we think the open versus closed argument is just a smokescreen to try and hide the real issue, which is, what's best for the customer, fragmented versus integrated. We think Android is very, very fragmented and becoming more fragmented by the day. And as you know, Apple's strives for the integrated model so that the user isn't forced to be the systems integrator. We see tremendous value in having Apple rather than our users' be the systems integrator. We think this is a huge strength of our approach compared to Google's. When selling to users who want their devices to just work, we believe integrated will trump fragmented every time. And we also think our developers can be more innovative if they can target a singular platform rather than a hundred variants. They can put their time into innovative new features rather than testing on hundreds of different handsets. So we are very committed to the integrated approach, no matter how many times Google tries to characterize it as closed. And we are confident that it will triumph over Google's fragmented approach, no matter how many times Google tries to characterize it as open. Second, I'd like to comment on the avalanche of tablets poised to enter the market in the coming months. First, it appears to be just a handful of credible entrants, not exactly an avalanche. Second, almost all of them use seven-inch screens as compared to iPad's near 10-inch screen. Let's start there. One naturally thinks that a seven-inch screen would offer 70% of the benefits of a 10-inch screen. Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. The screen measurements are diagonal, so that a seven-inch screen is only 45% as large as iPad's 10-inch screen. You heard me right; just 45% as large If you take an iPad and hold it upright in portrait view and draw an imaginary horizontal line halfway down the screen, the screens on the seven-inch tablets are a bit smaller than the bottom half of the iPad display. This size isn't sufficient to create great tablet apps in our opinion. Well, one could increase the resolution of the display to make up for some of the difference. It is meaningless, unless your tablet also includes sandpaper, so that the user can sand down their fingers to around one quarter of the present size. Apple's done extensive user-testing on touch interfaces over many years, and we really understand this stuff. There are clear limits of how close you can physically place elements on a touch screen before users cannot reliably tap, flick or pinch them. This is one of the key reasons we think the 10-inch screen size is the minimum size required to create great tablet apps. Third, every tablet user is also a smartphone user. No tablet can compete with the mobility of a smartphone, its ease of fitting into your pocket or purse, its unobtrusiveness when used in a crowd. Given that all tablet users will already have a smartphone in their pockets, giving up precious display area to fit a tablet in our pockets is clearly the wrong tradeoff. The seven-inch tablets are tweeners, too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad. Fourth, almost all of these new tablets use Android software, but even Google is telling the tablet manufacturers not to use their current release, Froyo, for tablets, and to wait for a special tablet release next year. What does it mean when your software suppliers does not (inaudible) to use their software in your tablet? And what does it mean when you ignore them and use it anyway? Fifth, iPad now has over 35,000 apps on the App Store. This new crop of tablets will have near zero. And sixth and last, our potential competitors are having a tough time coming close to iPad's pricing, even with their far smaller, far less expensive screens. The iPad incorporates everything we have learnt about building high value products from iPhones, iPods and Macs. We create our own A4 chip, our own software, our own battery chemistry, our own enclosure, our own everything. And this results in an incredible product at a great price. The proof of this will be in the pricing of our competitor's products which will likely offer less for more. These are among the reasons we think the current crop of seven-inch tablets are going to be DOA, Dead on Arrival. Their manufacturers will learn the painful lesson that their tablets are too small and increase the size next year, thereby abandoning both customers and developers who jumped on the seven-inch bandwagon with an orphan product. Sounds like lots of fun ahead. So thank you, and let me turn it back to Peter for the Q&A session.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And your first question will come from Richard Gardner with Citi.\nRichard Gardner - Citi: I had two quick ones, if I could. One is the supply constraints on iPad. Could you talk about how severe the supply constraints are on that product and how quickly you expect it to improve? And then a follow-up for Peter on gross margin please.\nTim Cook: Relative to iPad supply/demand, we\u2019ve got into a balanced situation in September with the limited number of distribution points in the 26 countries where we sold the iPad. And so we exited the quarter in a supply position that allows us to expand distribution prior to the holidays as we've planned for sometime. And hopefully you've seen some of the recent announcements of added partners in the United States. We're also expanding internationally, and will be launching additional countries as the quarter goes on.\nRichard Gardner - Citi: And then Peter, you mentioned several sequential tailwinds for gross margin during the September quarter. Could you talk about the headwinds in the quarter and what impact they had on gross margin sequentially, please?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I'm sorry, Rich, for the September quarter?\nRichard Gardner - Citi: For the September quarter, yes.\nPeter Oppenheimer: In our last conference call, we talked about several things that we thought would cause margins to come down some. And all those things did play out, but margins came down actually about half of what we thought that they would. And we did a bit better in the quarter because commodity and other costs were better than we thought, and we sold more iPhones than we had planned to.\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we have Gene Munster.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: If you can talk a little bit about the iPad opportunity you went through, and gave us some good insight in terms of the competitive landscape. But as analysts, we're here kind of trying to put some estimates out there and we're not doing a great job of trying to figure out this trajectory in the iPad. Can you help us understand how you think about the business a year or two years down the road in terms of size of your overall business, impact on enterprise, education, anything you can give to help us on that front? And then a follow-up question.\nSteve Jobs: Well, the iPad is clearly going to affect notebook computers. And I think the iPad proves, it's not a question of if, it's a question of when. And I think a lot of development and progress that will occur over the next few years. But we're already seeing tremendous interest in iPad from education, and much to my surprise, from business. We haven't pushed it real hard in business, and it's being grabbed out of our hands. And I talk to people everyday in all kinds of businesses that are using iPads, all the way from Boards of Directors that are shipping iPads around instead of board books, down to nurses and doctors in hospitals and other large and small businesses. So the more time that passes, the more I am convinced that we've got a tiger by the tail here. And this is a new model of computing which we've already got tens of millions of people trained on with the iPhone. And that lends itself to lots of different aspects of life both personal, educational and business. So, I see it as very general purpose, and I see it as really big. And the timing, one could argue about the timing endlessly, but I don't think one could argue that it's going to happen anymore.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Do you think this could be your second-biggest business in iPhone?\nSteve Jobs: I try to not predict, I try to just report. So, we'll keep you posted. As you know, we're already shipping more of them than Macs after just a few quarters.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: On the Flash side, any updates on your stance on Flash?\nSteve Jobs: Flash memory; we love Flash memory.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Peter, just one quick question. Our tracks were that you had about three weeks lead-time in most of your countries on the iPhone throughout the quarter. You mentioned you could have sold more iPhones. How do you think about what the true demand could have been in the quarter?\nTim Cook: I think that which you're referring to is the quote that's on the Apple Online Store. What I would say is that the demand in all countries is absolutely staggering. And at this point I can't predict when supply will meet demand. I feel great about our ability to move the supply and the sales up from an 8 million kind of number to over 14 million. But it's clear, last quarter that wasn't enough. And we are obviously working on that, but it will take some time to increase further.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Were you more supply-constrained in the September quarter versus the June quarter? Totally different dynamics in the quarter, but any perspective on the two quarters?\nTim Cook: It's clear that the iPhone 4 and the announcement of iPhone 4 and the demand for it took the demand to an entirely different level. And we had anticipated a very different level, but it's even higher than that.\nOperator: From RBC Capital Markets, we'll go to Mike Abramsky.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Steve, appreciate your commentary. You know, you are the tablet market right now. And this is I think the second time now you've come on to talk about or certainly at one time during your presentation to talk about competition. And I am just wondering, if much like Apple encroaching on whims, monopoly and enterprise, if you think that Apple's going to able to sustain share growth for tablets amid some of those new competitive headwinds? Some of those players may try different things and strategies like tethering and Flash, multi-tasking, less content and app restrictions and subsidized pricing. And just wondered if you think that, that may create itself a more fragmented market and how you see that rolling out with regard to Apple?\nSteve Jobs: I have a hard time envisioning what those strategies you mentioned are. I mean, in terms of pricing, so far, the little we've seen, the tablets with far less functionality are having a hard time matching us in price. Flash hasn't presented any problem at all. As you know, most of the video on the web is now available in HTML 5. And having the iTunes media store and over 35,000 apps on the App Store for iPad dwarfs anything else. And we think we have a very good product here that's going to be hard to match, and we're not done. We're working on a lot of things for the future. So I don't know exactly what these strategies are. And we've priced iPad pretty aggressively. So we're out to win this one.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: And just lastly, the smartphones, do you see that as a zero sum game?\nSteve Jobs: Well, as you know the largest market of phones today around the world are non smartphones. And so over the next several years, many of those non-smartphones are going to convert to smartphones. And the pie is going to continue to grow, and I think there will be room for some number of companies to be successful. But eventually, as most of those phones do convert to smartphones, it will turn into a zero sum game or at least a lot closer to that. But I think right now it's a battle for developers and a battle for the mindshare of developers and a battle for the mindshare of customers. And right now iPhone and Android are winning that battle.\nOperator: It's Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital.\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: First, for Peter, can you just talk a little bit about gross margins? You have gross margin guidance of 36. With component prices still favorable and probably more iPhone's being sold sequentially, can you just talk about why margins would go down sequentially, which seems also that you released the revenue on the bumper program? And then I have a follow-up for Steve, if you don't mind.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, in providing our guidance we thought about each of those factors that you cited, and we do see a small sequential decline. This has been primarily driven by a higher than expected mix of new iPod's that we just recently announced, and more iPad sales, and which as Steve said, we've been very aggressive with our pricing and are delivering great value to customers. So it's the higher mix of those on a sequential basis that I see impacting the gross margin slightly.\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Okay. And then Steve, can you just comment on how your hobby is doing, Apple TV? You took the hard drive out of there, and it seems like Apple is moving more to a streaming model work, you know, potentially a lot of other things, and I was just wondering what your thoughts were for the Apple TV, maybe that kind of business model proliferating into more products. But I was wondering how Apple TV is doing and what's your thoughts going forward?\nSteve Jobs: Well, we don't talk about unannounced products, but I'm happy to tell you what I know about Apple TV. We have gone to streaming model on Apple TV; it's complete streaming. So all the content is rented from the iTunes store or is streamed from your computer, or soon to be streamed from your iPhone or iPad with AirPlay. And so how is our new model of Apple TV doing? Well, I can report that in just a very short amount of time we've already sold a quarter million of them, over 250,000, and we're thrilled with that. I think that it's a great product and I think its $99 price point is very enticing. And I think when we get the AirPlay stuff in place before the end of this year, it's going to give another big reason for people to buy it. So we're really happy with how it's turned out.\nOperator: The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: First, for Peter, how much of the sequential decline in gross margin related to the iPhone in the September quarter and particularly the bumper program?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Katy, we've recorded a revenue deferral of just over $100 million in the September quarter for the bumper program. We would expect to record that in revenue in the December quarter. We did ship a number of bumpers in the September quarter, and that is reflected in our gross margin, as is the number that we expect to ship in the December quarter. That's reflected in our guidance as well.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: And just to be clear, is the iPhone the product segment that dropped the most sequentially as it relates to gross margins? I guess people are just asking what drove the sequential down tick which we haven't seen for some time.\nPeter Oppenheimer: You mean in the September quarter?\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Yes, in the September quarter.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well again, this was not a surprise to us. And we, on our last conference call highlighted that we would have a higher mix of iPhone 4 sales, and we were very aggressive with feature function there. So it had a different gross margin than its predecessor product. We also sold more iPads. Again, we were very aggressive there with our pricing. And we had the bumper program and some one-time items that occurred in June that we said wouldn't occur in September. So these were sort of the factors we saw bringing down gross margin. To some extent, each of them did occur in the September quarter, but we ended up doing about 50% better than we thought as a result of the commodity market and selling more iPhones.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: And then Steve, just as a follow-up. It seems like you fundamentally believe that Apple should be able to out-ship Android if you add up all the mobile devices over time. What are the key risks you're managing the company to make sure you don't lose that lead, whether it's distribution, or pricing, or features? What do you think the biggest risks are that you need to watch carefully?\nSteve Jobs: Well, our goal is to make the best devices in the world. It's not to be the biggest; as you know, Nokia is the biggest. And we admire them for being able to ship the number of handsets that they do. But we don't aspire to be like them. They are good at being like them. We want to be like us, and we want to make the best ones. So in our part of the market, Android is our biggest competitor. They out-shipped us in the June quarter as we were transitioning to iPhone 4. They out-shipped us for the first time according to Gartner's numbers, which we think are pretty accurate. And so we're waiting to find out what happened in this quarter. We'll find out. I don't know how we'll find out, but Gartner will put out some new numbers, and maybe others will, so one of these days we'll eventually learn. And I imagine we'll be competing with them for quite some time. But we have very different approaches. And we believe in our approach very strongly is providing users products that just work. And we think there is lots of users that want that in the world, and their approach is very different than that. And there maybe lots of users that want that their approach as well. But we're going to pursue ours and we think that's the winning approach in the end.\nOperator: And that will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: I guess this is for both Steve and Tim. I wanted to just better understand your aspirations for iPhone and iPad. Tim, I think I've heard you say, \"Look, we think about the Mac business as being one where we make the best products, but we're competing against kind of strong income and power in Microsoft. And we don't aspire to have high market share.\" In your iPod business it was kind of the opposite. You had very high volume, you drove price points down to entry points in the marketplace. And you have more than 50% market share globally. I think when we've talked about it in the past, you've actually said that you view the iPhone business as being more akin to the iPod business in terms of your aspiration. Steve, it sounded like that wasn't really consistent with what you said. You said very clearly, we don't want to be Nokia, we just to want to make good phone. So perhaps, you can help me better understand how we should think about your aspiration for both the iPhone and the iPad. Steve, you also made a comment about seven inch screens aren't going to cut it, and implying that you're not going to go down to those lower price points. Is your aspiration for iPhone and iPad to be volume players and market leaders? Or is it simply to make good products? And if you have smaller share like you do in Mac, that's fine. Can you help me with that, please?\nSteve Jobs: Sure, and I'll let Tim say what he's going to say too. First of all, Nokia makes $50 handsets, and we don't know how to make a great smartphone for $50. We're not smart enough to figure that one out yet, but believe me I'll let you know, when we do. So our goal is to make a really breakthrough great product. Make the best products in every industry that we compete in and to drive the cost down, while constantly making the products better at the same time. That's what we did with iPod. We updated our products many times every year, with better functionality oftentimes at the same price, and sometimes at a lower price. And it was this relentless improvement, and in some cases a lower price that was able to beat our competition and yield the market share that it did. And as you know, we have a very low market share in the phone market in the single digits, in terms of all the handsets. And we have a very high market share now in tablets, because we're the first mover. But we don't think about it that way. The reason we wouldn't make a seven inch tablet isn't because we don't want to hit a price point, it's because we don't think you can make a great tablet with a seven inch screen. We think it's too small to express the software that people want to put on these things. And we think as a software driven company, we think about the software strategies first. And we know that software developers they're not going to deal real well with all these different size products, when they have to redo their software, every time a screen size changes. And they're not going to deal well with products where they can't put enough elements on the screen to build the kind of apps they want to build. So when we make decisions on seven inch tablets, it's not about cost, it's about the value of the product when you factor in the software. You see what I'm getting at? So we're all about making the best products at aggressive prices. And that's what we will do and that's what we've done with the iPod, and that's what we will do with the iPad as well.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Tim, maybe you want to comment, if I could push you on that Steve. So if the market starts to move towards somewhat lower functionality smartphones in that migration of non-smartphones to smartphones that you talked about. If the market starts to move to dramatically lower price points, you feel you can't make an appropriate product that is good at those price points, you will cede share under those circumstances. Do I hear you correctly?\nSteve Jobs: You're looking at it wrong. You're looking at it as a hardware person in a fragmented world. You're looking at it as a hardware manufacturer that doesn't really know much about software, who doesn't think about an integrated product, but assumes the software will somehow take care of itself. And you're sitting around saying, \"Well, how can we make this cheaper? Well, we can put on a smaller screen on it and a slower processor, and less memory.\" And you assume that the software will somehow just come alive on this product that you're dreaming of, but it won't. Because these app developers have taken advantage of the products that came before with faster processors, with larger screens, with more capabilities that they can take advantage of to make better apps for customers. And it's a hard one because it throws you right back into the beginning of that chicken and egg problem again to change all the assumptions on those developers. Most of them will not follow you, most of them will say, \"I'm sorry, but I'm not going to go back and write a watered down version of my app just because you've got this phone that you can sell for $50 less and you're begging me to write software for it.\"\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: One more if I may, please, Steve? You now have more than $50 billion in cash. You're generating more than $20 billion a year in cash; it rests very comfortably on your balance sheet, earning less than 1% interest. What is your aspiration for that cash? And why are you not more open to returning some of that cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks or dividend?\nSteve Jobs: Of course that's been suggested to us. We strongly believe that one or more very strategic opportunities may come along that we're in a unique position to take advantage of because of our strong cash position. And I think we've demonstrated a really strong track record of being very disciplined with the use of our cash. We don't let it burn a hole in our pocket, we don't allow it to motivate us to do stupid acquisitions. And so I think that we'd like to continue to keep our powder dry because we do feel that there are one or more strategic opportunities in the future. That's the biggest reason. And there are other reasons as well that we could go into. But that's the biggest one.\nOperator: From Cross Research, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Steve and Tim, could you talk a little bit about the corporate opportunity? And what I'm looking for is sort how you're thinking about Apple as it's been positioned over the last several years, sort of more of a consumer focused, SMB focused company, but clearly there is a huge opportunity here with the iPad and the iPhone and probably at some point the Macs into the corporate world. So how do you think about your position from a marketing standpoint, a sales standpoint? Any changes you need to make, or how are you sort of addressing that?\nTim Cook: On the iPad, there have been some comments about this earlier, but just to give you some stats here, about two-thirds of the Fortune 100 are deploying or piloting iPad. And I don't know about you, but I've never seen an adoption like this in my life in enterprise. Enterprise is historically much slower moving on adoption. We're also seeing the iPad begin to pick up interest in K12 which is another market that historically adopts very, very slowly. And so the early data points look great. And as a matter of fact, we have built and are building additional capacity internally in the sales organizations, to call on businesses and obviously we have a huge amount of sales people already there calling on education institutions. We're also enabling in training our carrier partners to do the same. You probably saw a announcement last week with AT&T, and that's a direct result of customers wanting to buy the iPad on a postpaid type plan. And so we're putting a lot of energy in those. iPhone has followed a trajectory that gets into same kinds of numbers as I pointed on iPad where, or a little bit higher by now, is 85% of the Fortune 100 are deploying are deploying or piloting iPhone. And so this isn't a hobby or something we're doing lightly. We put enormous energy in the company, in engineering, in software to build a number of enterprise features in the OS. You've seen that, it gets better and better as we step through the different OS releases. And we're building the sales capability for those groups as well. It's clear that both the phone and the iPad have an enormous opportunity. The Mac is also increasingly getting pulled into an enterprise where the employees are able to select. And of course, this is a trend that we like to see, and that we think will continue in larger ways. But when people are given the choice, they would prefer a Mac, so Macs are being pulled in as well. We don't have as much distribution effort on that, but as we see if it gets any larger, we will move accordingly. The great thing is that we're maintaining our focus on the consumer, and the consumer is a forefront on thinking of all our products. And it's these consumers in the enterprise so to speak that are pulling these products in. And so we're not developing two different lines like many companies do and have enterprise versions and consumer versions. This is another part of our simplistic approach to things that I think will pay us great dividend and is already starting to do so.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: And I had a follow-up for Peter, I am getting substantial questions, as I am sure everybody on the call is, just about gross margin. So one of the questions I have is, as you're seeing the increase in volume, is there any kind of a change in terms of sort of the scale leverage you have from a manufacturing standpoint? I know you guided to lower gross margins, but the Street of course was higher? So, just anything you can give us in terms of color on the gross margins with the iPhone 4 in terms of how that's panning out and how we should think about start up costs that were associated with, both that as well as the iPad, just any color would be great?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We don't provide product specific gross margins but we are always working aggressively to lower our costs whether it's the iPhone or any of our other products. I think we have a very good track record in this regard. And we were happy with our gross margins in the September quarter, they were ahead of what we thought. And we see them being just down slightly in the December quarter as we ship more iPods where we've been quite aggressive and continue to ship more iPads as well.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: I am interested in understanding demand from new carriers to take up iPhone 4 and whether or not you're seeing any pressure on subsidies as you look to expand your distribution networks on the phone business?\nTim Cook: Chris, the pressure that I am getting is on supply. Virtually everyone we're doing business with wants more supply. So that's the pressure that I feel.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Can you give us some color, sorry if I missed this, I jumped on late, but some color in terms of where you are from a number of carriers with iPhone 4, how did you end the quarter? Do you have targets for the December quarter in terms of carrier penetration with existing relationships?\nTim Cook: We have, if you count at the country level, we have about 166 relationships that we ended the quarter with in about 89 countries. And so that's a significant expansion across from last year as we in many countries went from a single carrier relationship to more than one carrier. The latest country that we have done that in or that we've announced that in is Germany and we will be launching both with Vodafone and O2 together with our existing partner T-Mobile in Germany later this month.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: And all 166 of the carriers have the phone 4 by year end, is that the target?\nTim Cook: With iPhone 4, we're in 85 of those 89 countries. And I believe that we will be in all 89 by the end of the year.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: And what is your experience then when you've gone non-exclusive from a subsidy and margin standpoint on the phone, have you had to give anything up in the past?\nTim Cook: We don't give specific information out on the margins. But I think you can look at our ASPs and see that they've generally stayed above $600, and that's despite opening up several markets from an exclusive market to a non-exclusive market.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Steve, you discussed competitors not matching Apple's price point so far on the tablet space. Why do you think you have an advantage on the price point for iPad versus the PC manufacturers?\nSteve Jobs: Well, I think part of it is because we engineer so much of it ourselves. The A4 chip inside it is an Apple creation; everything, again, as I mentioned from the battery chemistry to the enclosures. And we've learned a lot. We've learned a lot from the miniaturization we've done on iPods and iPhones. And we're a very high volume consumer electronics manufacturer. So I think we've learned a lot. We've developed a lot of our own components where other have to buy them on the market with middlemen, getting their cut of things. I think we're systems architects and know how to build systems in a very efficient way. So I think this is a product we've been training for, for the last decade.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks to everyone for joining us today.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are extremely pleased to report outstanding results for the June quarter. During the quarter, we began shipping iPad to millions of delighted customers in 10 countries, we\u2019ve launched the very popular iPhone 4, we shipped iOS 4 with many great new features, and we set a new all-time record for quarterly Mac sales. We are shipping the best products in Apple\u2019s history, and response from our customers has been terrific. And as a result, we are thrilled to announce today our highest quarterly revenue ever, surpassing the previous record set in the most recent holiday quarter. Revenue was $15.7 billion, an increase of $6 billion or 61% over the prior June quarter\u2019s results. The tremendous revenue growth was driven primarily by the very successful launch of iPad, in addition to the strong sales of iPhone and Mac. Operating margin was $4.23 billion representing 27% of revenue. Net income was $3.25 billion up 78% over the year-ago quarter and earnings per share were $3.51. Turning to the details of our results, I would like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated record quarterly sales of 3.47 million Macs, exceeding the previous record established in the most recent December quarter by over 100,000. This represents 33% year-over-year growth compared to IDCs latest published estimate of 22% growth for the market overall in the June quarter. We are pleased to have outgrown the global market in both the desktop and portable categories. We experienced strong double-digit Mac growth in each of our geographies, led by both the continued momentum of iMac, and the very popular MacBook Pro family, which was updated in April with faster processors, more powerful graphics and even longer battery life. We are also pleased to report record Mac sales in our US education institution business despite state budget constraints. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory. Moving onto our music products, we sold 9.4 million iPods, compared to 10.2 million in the year ago quarter. Sales of iPod Touch continued to be very strong with sales growing 48% year-over-year. The continued mix shift towards iPod Touch resulted in an overall iPod ASP increase of 12%, generating total iPod revenue growth of 4%. iPod\u2019s share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. iPod also continued to be the top selling MP3 player and to gain share internationally year-over-year in nearly every country we track based on the latest data published by GFK. The iTunes store had another great quarter with revenue exceeding $1 billion and growing 25% year-over-year. The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success with more than 225,000 apps available including more than 11,000 apps specifically for iPad. iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad users have downloaded over 5 billion apps from the App Store. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory. I would now like to turn to iPhone. We were very pleased with iPhone sales of 8.4 million, including over 1.7 million iPhone\u2019s 4s in the initial five countries where it was launched. This represents 61% year-over-year growth and is considerably higher than IDCs latest published estimate of 38% growth for the global Smart Phone market overall in the June quarter. Customers are loving the great new features of iPhone 4, including FaceTime for video calling, the high resolution Retina display, HD video recording, and the beautiful new glass and stainless steel design. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $5.33 billion during the quarter compared to $3.06 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 74%. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $5 billion, which yields an ASP of about $595. At the end of the June quarter, we had iPhone distribution with 154 carriers in 88 countries. We continued to experience very strong year-over-year growth, particularly in Asia, Europe and Japan. Additionally, we continued to be very pleased with strong sales growth from both long-standing and new carrier partners. During the quarter, we surpassed cumulative sales of 100 million iOS devices. Response to the iOS 4, since its June 21 launch, has been very favorable with customers and reviewers praising its many new features including multitasking, folders, enhanced mail and deeper enterprise support. Turning to iPad, we are off to an amazing start, and we are extremely pleased with customer response of sales to date. Through the end of the June quarter, we shipped 3.27 million iPads to customers in 10 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was 2.17 billion. The sales value of iPads alone was almost $2.1 billion, which yields an ASP of about $640. Feedback from customers continues to be outstanding as more and more of them experience iPad and take advantage of its multi-touch user interface, large screen and high-quality graphics to browse the web, read and send e-mail, read e-Books and much more. We look forward to bringing iPad to customers in nine additional countries on July 23. I would now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had an outstanding quarter generating record revenue and customer traffic. The retail revenue was $2.58 million compared to $1.49 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 73%. Our stores sold 677,000 Macs compared to 492,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 38%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the June quarter were to customers who have never owned a Mac before. We opened seven new stores during the quarter, including four in the US, two in Australia and one in Canada, ending with 293 stores. With an average of 287 stores open during the June quarter, average revenue per store was $9 million compared to $5.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin was $593 million compared to $387 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 60.5 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 38.6 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 57%. We expect to open 24 stores this quarter, including our fabulous new stores in Paris and Shanghai, which opened earlier this month, our seventh bargain [ph] store in London, and our first two stores in Spain to be open in Barcelona and Madrid. Total company gross margin was 39.1%, which was 310 basis points above our guidance. This difference was driven by two categories of factors. The first category accounted for a little over half of the difference. When we provided our guidance for the June quarter, we identified five things that we expected to drive a sequential decline in gross margin from the March to June quarters. These were the first quarter of iPad sales, a stronger US dollar, our portable Mac transition, the beginning of the education buying season, and the iPhone 4 transition. Collectively, these things did have an impact sequentially, but to a lesser extent than we had anticipated in our guidance. The second category of factors, which accounted for the reminder of the difference consisted of unanticipated favorable adjustments, as well as leverage on the higher than expected revenue. Operating expenses were $1.9 billion and included $181 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E for a quarter was $58 million. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.2%, about three points below our guidance as a result of two factors. First, we had a better mix of foreign earnings, and this accounted for about two thirds of the difference. Second, we finalized favorably some prior year US tax audits, accounting for the remainder of the difference. As a result of the better mix of foreign earnings, we have lowered our expected fourth-quarter tax rate from 27% to 26.5%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $45.8 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $41.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, an increase of $4.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $4.8 billion. Our investment priorities for cash continues to be preservation of capital, and We are continuing to focus on relatively short dated high quality investments, and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio. Looking ahead to the September quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. As we announced on Friday, we will be offering free cases to all customers who have purchased an iPhone 4 through September 30. As a result, we will be deferring revenue corresponding to the value of the cases that are yet to be ordered by or delivered to eligible customers under this offer as of the end of the September quarter. We estimate this deferral to be about $175 million, and we expect the September quarter deferral to be recognized as revenue in the December quarter. We will recognize the cost of the cases upon delivery to our customers. We expect revenue to be about $18 billion compared to $12.2 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 35%, reflecting approximately $40 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect most of the sequential decline to be due to a higher mix of iPhone 4 and iPad sales, which have higher cost structures and provide great value to customers, as well as the revenue deferral impact of the iPhone 4 case offer. To a lesser extent we expect the sequential decline to be driven by back-to-school promotion, and the absence of the favorable adjustments that benefited the gross margin in the June quarter. We expect OpEx to be about $2 billion, including about $195 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $50 million reflective of the short-term interest rate environment, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $3.44. In closing, we are thrilled with our record June quarter revenue and strong financial performance. We are very pleased with sales of iPad and iPhone 4. We are working hard on catching up with customer demand for these great products, and we look forward to rolling them out to even more customers in more countries this quarter. We are very pleased with the market share gains for our iPhones, Macs and iPods, and remain very confident in our new product pipeline. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.\nOperator: (Operator instructions) Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Hi, thank you very much and good afternoon. Could you talk a bit about what you are hearing from corporations on their thought on the iPhone, the iPad and Macs, just what you are seeing in terms of corporate adoption.\nTim Cook: Hi, Shannon, it is Tim. If you look at the iPhone, we\u2019re now up to more than 80% of the Fortune 100 that are deploying or piloting the iPhone, and we also see very good momentum in the Fortune 500. In fact, over 60% of the Fortune 500 are deploying or piloting iPhone. This is also transcending into education institution, and we see around 400 higher education institutions, which have included the iPhone for faculty, staff and students. And so, iPhone is really taking off and iOS 4 was another help in doing that. In terms of the Macintosh, you can see the Mac had an incredible quarter. We are still selling principally to consumer and education, but we are seeing businesses with increasing interest in the Mac. It is more difficult to measure, because many of those sales are built into the channel. We\u2019re obviously thrilled with growing 33% year-on-year.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: And then the iPad?\nTim Cook: The iPad, very surprisingly in the first quarter, during the first 90 days we already have 50% of the Fortune 500 that are deploying or testing the iPad. This is incredible. That is the Fortune 100, excuse me.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Okay, and then \u2013 it is great. And then I had a follow up for Peter, when you talked about the growth margin upside this quarter, you mentioned that half of that came from you know those 5 areas performing better than you had expected. Can you give us any more specifics on why exactly those areas, you know, were better than you had anticipated?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure, Shannon, the largest contributors were higher iPhone sales than we had included in our guidance and also higher accessory sales as well.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Okay, great. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: And that will come from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: Okay, great. Thanks. Tim, I wanted to start just by asking to you give us a supply/demand breakdown for each of the product categories if you would, and talk about any notable supply constraints within each product line, and how severe they are and when you expect them to be alleviated?\nTim Cook: Okay. Rich, starting with the Mac there were no significant supply demand issues during the quarter, and they are none currently. On the iPod it is the same, none of significance last quarter and none currently. The iPad and the iPhone are significantly different. Both of these products, the iPad and specifically the iPhone 4 we had backlog at the end of last quarter that we were not able to fill and currently we are still selling both of those products as best as we can make them. So, we still are quoting longer lead times than we like, and we are working around the clock to try to get supply and demand in balance. In the scheme of things, it is a good problem to have.\nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: And Tim, are you willing to provide, I guess any additional color on what the sources of constraint are and when you expect those to be alleviated or is it just simply a demand problem and not so much a supply problem?\nTim Cook: Well, I don\u2019t think \u2013 high demand is never a problem. On the iPad, as I have mentioned last quarter, we went into the iPad thinking that planning of 1 million from our capacity was a very bold move. And in fact if you look at the \u2013 a lot of the industry analysts were predicting that we would only sell somewhere around that number for the whole calendar year. And as you know, we did 1 million in the first month, and then the second million in the second month, and the third million in the third month. So, basically what we are doing is we\u2019re increasing capacity as quickly as we can, and you know there are a number of things that we have to increase in order to do that. But I am fairly confident that we will be able to increase the capacity. It is not a situation where there is something profound that we can\u2019t eventually increase. The iPhone, we just started ramping it in June. We had very limited days last quarter. As you know, we launched on the 24, and the quarter ended on 26. And we were still ramping and increasing volume, but again there is not a specific thing that is overwhelming. It is just a matter of getting up the ramp.\nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: Okay, and then if I could, Peter, you mentioned actually the mix of iPhone 4 and iPad sales as a negative for gross margin this coming quarter, and iPhone 4, well, iPhone in general I guess has typically had margins that are well above the corporate average. Just wondering why you would put that on the negative side of the ledger for gross margins for September, and was hoping you could tell us \u2013 give us a little more detail on the adjustments that possibly affected the gross margin in June.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Let me start with your second question, I don\u2019t want to go into a lot of specificity there, but we did have some adjustments that occurred in our supply chain and some other product cost that benefited us in June, they were the larger contributor or the second set of factors that I outlined for you. As regards to our gross margin for the September quarter, we have just introduced the iPad and the iPhone 4. We are delivering great value to customers, and these products have higher cost structures, and in the case of the iPhone 4 it has a higher cost structure than the predecessor product that we were shipping. So, while the margin there is attractive, on a sequential basis we have been pretty aggressive here with pricing, and it is going to play through a bit on the margin line.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Rich.\nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we will hear from Gene Munster.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Hi, good afternoon and congratulations. The iPhone number was strong despite a lot of moving parts in the channel in terms of inventory this quarter versus a year ago when you launched the 3GS. Can you talk a little bit about what those dynamics were and how they impacted the 8.4 million unit number you printed?\nTim Cook: Yes, Gene, it is Tim. We greatly reduced shipments of the previous generation iPhone beginning around June 7, which was our Worldwide Developers Conference, and coincided with the announcement of the iPhone 4. But as you probably know, we did not launch the iPhone 4 and the new figure by 3GS until June 24, which was only three days before the end of the quarter. The result of that was we had significantly lower sales after June 7 for that period of time, as we waited on the official launch. In fact, if you looked at our year-over-year growth rate prior to June 7, it was around 90%. And as you know we exited the quarter, you can see that from the data sheets, we exited the quarter with total iPhone sales up 61%. And so basically we did a channel adjustment. We pulled the previous generation of iPhones down significantly in channel inventory. We increased from zero the iPhone 4 inventory and the inventory of the 8 GB 3GS, and the net reduction in the channel was about a quarter of a million units from the beginning of the quarter. And I would remind you that as you probably guessed, the run rate associated with the sales of the new product are larger than the run rate associated with sales of the old product, and so in terms of any kinds of weeks of inventory it would be much less than where we were running before.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Okay. So last quarter, I think your comment was you had about 2.7 million units in the channel. Is that correct?\nTim Cook: Yes, that is right, and so ended with about 2.45, and if you look at the ins and outs in that just to give you the numbers, the previous generation drawdown by the end of the quarter was slightly less than 1.3 million, and the combination of iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS was up about a million. And the vast majority of the million was in transit at the end of the quarter lot available for sale.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Okay. So, is it safe to say that you would have printed around 8.7 million iPhones if assuming more of a normalized inventory levels throughout the quarter?\nTim Cook: Well, if we would have held inventory flat from the beginning of the quarter, we would have done a little over 250,000 more units. However, what we really wanted to do is the \u2013 if we had the opportunity quite frankly is to take inventory up quarter-over-quarter, beginning of the quarter, the end of the quarter because the sales run rate was larger at the end of the quarter with the new product.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Okay, and just quickly, I have a philosophical question that I can understand why you guys run out of products and the iPad comes out and it is the first time are you doing it, but these shortages that we have right out of the gate, can you just give us any insight? There is obviously a lot of talk that you guys purposely do this just to create buzz. I suspect that that's not the case, but can you give us any insight into a company that understands how to build products as well as you do that we still have these problems going into those product launches?\nTim Cook: Well, on the \u2013 let me answer that in two different ways. If you look at the previous generation product, we call the number of units that we are going to sell many weeks beforehand, and when we run out, we run out and quite frankly we tend to manage that aggressively on purpose because we were ready to market and moved very quickly to the new product. And that is what happened here, and frankly speaking I\u2019m glad that it happened, and it is exactly the way that we want to manage it. In terms of the new product, we do not purposely create a shortage for buzz. I\u2019m not sure where that comes from, but that is certainly not our objective. We would like to fill every customers order as quickly as we can. The demand for iPhone 4 is absolutely stunning. And we\u2019re working very hard to catch up with demand and I can\u2019t predict when that will occur that I can tell you that everyone is working very hard to do it.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: And just last question and I will turn it over. Since the issues with the antenna have you seen any changes in demand or what changes have you seen in demand for iPhone 4?\nTim Cook: We are, Gene, let me be very clear on this. We are selling every unit we can make currently.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Great. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Gene. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.\nBen Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks. I guess I just want to elaborate on that last question a little more, Tim. So you haven't seen any slowdown in order rates online or your lead times remain the same, and is that what you mean you haven't seen any slowdown in order rates or any increase in returns that are noticeable in the marketplace?\nTim Cook: My phone is ringing off the hook for people that want more supply. So, right now it is hard to address the real question that you are asking about is there an effect or not because we\u2019re selling everyone that we can make, and so you can\u2019t run the experiment that way.\nBen Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: And on the return issue, is there anything noticeable, maybe I will tease the answer because we're not seeing a huge blip up but are you?\nTim Cook: The returns that we have seen on the iPhone 4 are less than the iPhone 3GS that Pete shared in the presentation of products, and the ones for this specific issue are extremely small.\nBen Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay. Moving on with regard to the iPad, when do you think supply and demand will be in balance? And maybe if you can refer back to your experience with other products that have soaring demand and when you got the equilibrium or is there any other experience that's comparable that you can give us any indication of when you feel you could be in equilibrium for such a hot product?\nTim Cook: We honestly don\u2019t know the answer. We have been pleasantly surprised at how fast this product has gotten out of the shoot. If you look at how long it took us to sell the first million iPods, the 20 plus months versus the one month of iPad, it is just a phenomenal difference. It is not following a typical early adoptive curve, and then, you know, taking a long time to cross into the mainstream. And so I don\u2019t know how high it is. Our guts tell us that this market is very big, and we believe that iPad is really defining the market. And we want to take full advantage of it and so we\u2019re investing enormous time and resource in increasing our capability and getting iPad out to as many people as we can.\nBen Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay. And then just finally maybe, Peter, for you are you surprised on how many people want the 3G product for the iPad, and since you launched that product what is the split between 3G and Wi-Fi?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not going to disclose the split between that, but all of the models have been very popular as I commented in my prepared remarks, and Tim just did. The demand has just been amazing and this is off to an incredible start, and overall ASP in the June quarter for iPad was about $640.\nBen Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Just would seem like that's the base ASP because now have you a better mix of 3Gs, so that might be the low point. But okay, I will cede the floor. Thank you so much.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We will move on to Brian Marshall with Gleacher & Company.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Gleacher & Company: Thanks. Nice quarter. A question with regards to the upside that you saw in the Mac as well as the iPhone units, I mean that's pretty impressive considering iPad came in very strongly this quarter as well, so do you have any updated thoughts kind of longer term philosophical perspective about how the iPad will potentially cannibalize or take away some dollars from some of your other product lines going forward?\nTim Cook: It is a very good question, and it is one that we do talk about internally. And we have only been selling for three months, and so I think the real answer is that it is too early to tell. If you do want to take the quarter that we just finished, we\u2019re thrilled that we reported our best Mac quarter ever in the same quarter that iPad sold almost 3.3 million units, and so for us it is a jaw dropper.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Gleacher & Company: Okay, and was wondering if you can give us any updates on how the iAd business is coming to fruition here?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes. We have just launched the iAd in the early part of July. We are going to learn a lot this calendar year and build a foundation for the future. And beyond that, I don\u2019t have any further specifics to share with you today.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Gleacher & Company: Okay. And final question is I was wondering if you can you give us just an update on how the data center build in coming along in North Carolina and that's it. Thank you\nPeter Oppenheimer: North Carolina is on schedule. Everything is going fine.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Gleacher & Company: Can you share with the schedule is with us, Peter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We expect to complete it by the end of the calendar year and begin to use it.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 Gleacher & Company: Great. Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Brian. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We will hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit the gross margin question, please. Peter, on your guidance last quarter, you basically said about a quarter of the expected sequential decline in gross margins was expected to come from iPads, about 150 basis points. Relative to your expectation on that, what kind of impact did iPad have on gross margins versus your guidance, and why may it have been different?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Toni, the factors that we cited last quarter largely on a collective basis were as we thought. And we did about 310 basis points better than we had guided too, and a little more than half of that was those five factors, not being as quiet as deep as we thought. And the biggest piece of that difference really came from selling more iPhones and selling accessories. So the other factors were generally about what we thought they would be.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: So if we think about it, you are expecting to be down about 570 basis points, you were down about 260 basis points, but you had mentioned you had a favorable benefit as well as some operating leverage. What was the collective impact of those two positive forces of operating leverage in favorable? So were you down? You thought you would be down 570 from those factors and you were down 400 to 450, and then you had favorable impact of 150 from the other two factors, or how do we think about that in basis points?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. So, we were ahead of what we thought by about 310 basis points. A little more than half of that came from the 5 factors not being quite as deep as we thought, and it was mostly selling more iPhones and more accessories that drove that. A little less than half of the 310 basis points occurred from the unanticipated favorable adjustments and the leverage on the higher revenue. And the favorable adjustments were the bigger piece of that segment growth.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Okay, thank you. That's helpful. On the favorable adjustments, can you comment on whether they were one-time and whether they are discretionary, any more color you can provide on those?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I don\u2019t expect them \u2013 the ones that we benefited from to reoccur, and again I don\u2019t want to be specific but these were things that really just occurred in our supply chain and with other product costs.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: And on the \u2013 Tim, you had talked a little bit about channel inventory. It sounds like, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you might have 1.4 million in existing channel inventory of the older 3GS, the 16 and the 32 gig. Is that a correct, and where and how are those being sold currently?\nTim Cook: Toni, we had about 1.4 on June 26, which was the end of the fiscal quarter. Currently, we have materially less than that. And those are being sold at basically most, not all, but most of the \u2013 in most of the countries that we sell the 3GS.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: And have you been able to take up that so since the end of the quarter the June 26th have you had any progress in increasing your total channel inventory or you feel like you are fighting a losing battle?\nTim Cook: I never feel like I am fighting a losing battle. But on iPhone 4, we are selling things as quickly as we make them, and so we have more work to do there.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: But I guess that implication would be if you have taken down inventory of the non-iPhone 4 product, and you are selling them as quickly as you can, that would actually suggest your total inventory would be even lower now than it was on June 26th?\nTim Cook: Well, keep in mind that we also sell the iPhone 3GS 8 gig, it is a new model in the line. And so the 1.4 million that I was referring to that I assumed that you were also referring to for the iPhone 3GS units that were in the previous generation.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Correct. Thank you.\nTim Cook: You would have to look at the whole line.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: And final question, you had talked a little bit about cannibalization of iPad on Macs and I know you talked about the iPod and iPod Touch on a year-over-year basis, but sequentially, your ASPs fell quite a bit on the iPod business. Do you think there may be any cannibalization of iPad on iPod Touches and specifically can you comment on whether iPod Touch was a higher percentage of units sold or actually if you sold higher percentage of units sold in Q3 versus Q2?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Toni, our iPod ASPs were down about $7 sequentially. And that really was driven by the start of the back to school promotion, which we began in the month of June and a stronger US dollar. We did mix on a year-over-year basis up into iPod Touch, and I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have on a sequential basis the test mix in front of me.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Toni. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Hi. Thank you. I had a couple as well. Peter, when the iPhone, when you were using the accrual accounting or the deferred accounting rather on the iPhone, the deferred balances indicated that margins went up over time. Would you anticipate that the iPad margins would increase as we move forward?\nPeter Oppenheimer: We were purposely aggressive when we launched the iPad, because we absolutely believed we had a great product and we had a great first mover advantage. So, we were aggressive coming out of the shoots, and as both Tim and I have commented, we are selling them as quickly as we can make them. I think it was a very, very good way to launch the product for us.\n :\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Okay. A few to follow-ups, Peter, is there any comments that you could make on the impact of the bumpers? I know you said you were incurring the costs in the September quarter. Is there any way to quantify in terms of a basis points or any other metric that you can give us for the impact in the September quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, there are two impacts of this. The first is we will need to defer revenue for the iPhone 4s that we sell, where we have not delivered the bumpers, and where we have not heard from the customers wanting to place an order. And I expect the accrual that we will need to make, which is a revenue accrual with no cost to be about $175 million in the September quarter, and I would expect to have that be recorded as revenue in the December quarter. We will expense the cost of the bumpers when we ship them to customers, and our most important objective there is to take care of every customer and delight them.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Okay, I guess the last question for me then is directed to Tim if I could. Android-based shipments are certainly increasing and gaining a lot of press. I wondered if you guys could give any color about where you might be seeing Android as competition to the iPhone family in terms of GO or customer sets or any other color there, and that's my last question. Thank you.\nTim Cook: You know, I haven\u2019t seen the android results for June, since it is some of several companies\u2019 shipments. But iPhone sales were up 61% in the June quarter despite the inventory drawdown and the transition that we spoke about. And that is against the IDC estimate Smart phone market growth of 38%. And so we are growing substantially faster than the market.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Keith. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From RBC Capital Markets, we will hear from Michael Abramsky.\nMichael Abramsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Hi, thanks very much. Tim, do you think that there has been some sort of I think still some questions around sustainability of iPad demand after early adopters and international channel fill, even with new product cycles given that it is still a relatively new category, and I am wondering what your thoughts are there, and also given that there may be some competitive subsidized 3G tablets coming in the fall. How do you see that potentially impacting or not the iPod pricing strategy or demand? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Mike, the only thing I can share right now is that on iPad, we are absolutely selling every unit that we can make, and it looks good in every country that we have launched in so far, and we are excited about launching in additional countries this coming week. And anecdotally it does seem to me that it is beyond an early adopter stage, already as I indicated earlier, just based on watching the people that are using it. And so, it is the fastest that that has happened in any product I know of, or have ever been involved with. So, I think it is extremely unique and extremely special. In terms of what the competition does, I don\u2019t know what they will do and what they will try. It is no secret that everybody is trying to work on something to come out with it, but we are extremely happy with our competitive position, and the business model that we have. If you look at the US as an example, since everybody can look at that model where you have a very affordable rate structure that starts at $15 with no commitment at all. And a very aggressive price that seems to be what the end-user really desires. And so yes, somebody could come in and jack the rate plans way up, and subsidize, I\u2019m not so sure that people are really going to want another contract. We will see if somebody tries that and we\u2019ll both learn. Right now we\u2019re thrilled with our position.\nMichael Abramsky \u2013 RBC Capital Markets: Thanks, Tim.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will come from Charles Wolf with Needham & Co.\nCharles Wolf \u2013 Needham & Co.: Yes, in the past, iPhone software developers have complained not about the App Store rules, but the fact that they were arbitrary. Has Apple done anything to address this issue?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Charlie, I think that we are always looking to make our developers happy. We have over 225,000 Apps on the store with over 5 billion downloads. We were thrilled to have very recently crossed $1 billion in payments to our developers, and we\u2019ve just launched iAd, you know, with the primary objective of developing another revenue stream for that. So we care deeply about our developers and want to have many, many great Apps for our iOS products and the success that we\u2019ve had on the store today is unparalleled.\nTim Cook: Charlie, I would just add that the vast majority of Apps are retrieved within seven days of their submission, and that many of the Apps that aren\u2019t approved have bugs in them, and are eventually resubmitted and approved. And we obviously I think all of us want to ensure that pornography and graphic scenes don\u2019t make their way to the platform, and so you know, I think these are things that I realize not 100% that everybody is going to agree with. I think many of us would want us those to occur.\nCharles Wolf \u2013 Needham & Co.: Well, just asking the question slightly differently, do you think the concern of developers is really misplaced?\nTim Cook: We value the input of every developer and very much listen to them and modify the programs accordingly, when it\u2019s appropriate to do that and so I\u2019m not going to say every concern out there is misplaced. We\u2019re very open to any kind of feedbacks.\nCharles Wolf \u2013 Needham & Co.: Okay, thanks, Tim.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Charlie. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Next question will come from Shaw Wu with Kaufman Brothers.\nShaw Wu \u2013 Kaufman Brothers: Thanks. I have two questions. First, just on your desktop Mac business, normally it is up sequentially from March to June and I understand there is a secular trend towards portables. Is there anything else, any color you can share there that's occurring?\nTim Cook: Shaw, it\u2019s Tim. You have a little bit of ying and yang when we announce new portables. You will see a substantially move to portables and when there is not a new desktop announced at the same time, so I think that\u2019s more of what we saw than anything else, but yes there is clearly a move to mobility and in the long, long, long run, I think you\u2019ll see portables grow as a percentage of mix continually.\nShaw Wu \u2013 Kaufman Brothers: Okay. Thanks for the color. And then just second question is just on FaceTime, you talked about how you wanted to turn that into an industry standard. Just wondering how you plan to roll that out? I mean, will it be available on Windows? Will it be available \u2013 I imagine today it is on the iPhone. What about on the Mac? Any color you can share there? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Shaw, I want to make sure that we get to all of the financial related questions today. So I\u2019m going to hold that one for another day.\nShaw Wu \u2013 Kaufman Brothers: Okay. Thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shaw. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Morgan Stanley, Katy Huberty.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Yes, Thanks. Good afternoon. Tim, when Peter was walking through the iPhone business, he said the iPhone revenues and units were particularly strong in Asia, Europe and Japan. Would love your sense as to why North America isn't on that list. Are we hitting lot of large numbers, or is there anything you can do to really reaccelerate the growth in the domestic market?\nTim Cook: I don\u2019t think we are hitting lot of large numbers. I think that the market over time will increasingly \u2013 the phone market will increasingly become a smart phone market, and you know, Steve said that long ago, and we\u2019ve seen that forecast has come true as the smart phone market continues to grow at multiples of the basic handset market that is shrinking. I think we have a lot of opportunity domestically and in the other parts of the America for that. I think Peter\u2019s comment was more that our growth as a company whether you look at Mac, iPhone or iPod is we\u2019re growing faster internationally than we are domestically and you can see that in the revenues as well; however, I think you have to put that in perspective because the company\u2019s revenues in Americas are growing over 40%, and so this is a huge number. We\u2019re not talking about a low number. It\u2019s just that the international numbers are absolutely killer.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley: And just on a more global basis, a lot of the iPhone growth has come from broadening distribution among carriers and in new countries, can you just cover the opportunity that you see or don't see to broaden within countries you are already in to go after emerging markets like China and India and then just quickly thoughts on prepaid markets and whether that is an opportunity for you?\nTim Cook: Yes, I think both on the Mac and the iPhone and later the iPad as we roll it out to more places, I think there is still extraordinary opportunity left. I mean if you look at the Mac as an example, in Asia Pacific the Macs grew 73% year-over-year. This is phenomenal. You know, that we could grow by this much and in China we grew 144%. In Korea, we grew 184%. In Hong Kong, we almost doubled and even in a country like Spain where the economy has clearly been very difficult the Mac grew 59%. And so you know, there is some very, very extraordinary numbers in there. In the iPhone space, we are doing well in basically all of the key markets, and so in terms of expanding that, we \u2013 learning what we have learned with the exclusive deals and continuing to look market by market as I\u2019ve indicated in the past, we\u2019ve elected to open Spain up, and at the end of this month, we will go from an exclusive carrier market to having three carriers, and so that\u2019s one example. There are also more countries remaining, and frankly there is still increased distribution and increased market penetration like enterprise and consumer and a general move in the marketplace from the basic voice and text phones to the smart phone, all of which are in the iPhone favor, and so honestly I just see an enormous amount of opportunity out there and our biggest challenge is to decide which of these two deploy resources against not to have good ideas about which ones are \u2013 about making the list of ideas.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From JP Morgan, we will go to Mark Moskowitz.\nMark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan: Thank you. Two quick questions. Tim, just coming back to the iPad for a second, I know there is a lot of speculation about potential cannibalization down the road while it is still premature to speculate. I am just trying to get a sense, could there actually be a reverse effect where Apple maybe benefits from a halo effect where folks buy the iPad, and then they also decide maybe to buy some other Apple devices to keep at home when they're using the iPad on the road? In the early stages, has your data shown that where you are seeing someone buying an iPad, and then there is a subsequent purchase of a MacBook or iMac or an iPhone?\nTim Cook:\n : And so could that happen on iPhone and iPad. You know, we\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t want to predict it but I do think that with our Mac share, the Mac has outgrown the market 17 straight quarters. However, the Mac share is still low and so there is still an enormous opportunity for the Mac to grow and certainly the more customers we can introduce to Apple through iPads and through iPhones and through iPods, you would think that there would might be some synergy with the Mac there, and there may be synergy between the iPad and the iPhones and so on and so forth and so that\u2019s the way that we look at it internally instead of the negative although I know everybody is more focused on the negative piece of it. You know, this is for it\u2019s great to be to have a lower share because if it turns out that the iPad cannibalizes PCs that I think it\u2019s fantastic for us because there is a lot of PCs to cannibalize. It\u2019s still a big market.\nMark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan: Thanks, Tim. Maybe I can shift gears to Peter real quickly. Peter, have you had a chance to kind of formulate what could be the scenario whereby some of the subcontractors that you work with that they do have to put through significant wage hikes over the next course of the contract, renewals over the next year, subcontract renewals over the next year or so, how would that impact Apple? You have to absorb any of those kind of pass through on the wage hikes or where those subcontractors have to absorb 100% of the wage hikes?\nTim Cook: You know, this is Tim again; we don\u2019t want to get into the terms of our commercial agreements. We hold these to be competitive advantages and do not want to release those.\nMark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan: Okay. That's fine. Thank you\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: And that will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. Tim, earlier you mentioned a lot of opportunity domestically for the iPhone. Do you need to expand your carrier relationships to tap that, or do you think there is plenty of head room with AT&T?\nTim Cook: No, I don\u2019t want to get into what we will or will not do. I would say that we\u2019re very happy to be a partner with AT&T, and you know, they have been a first-class partner and have really pioneered the smart phone growth from a network point of view in the US, and that\u2019s all I have to say about that.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay. Secondly on the gross margin guidance just back of the envelope it seems to suggest iPhone margins will be down maybe 10 or 15 points quarter-on-quarter. Is that in the right neighborhood, and if so can you provide a little more color which components are driving that? It seems to contradict third party data around the bill of material costs for that product.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Chris, it is Peter. Let me begin by suggesting that you don\u2019t put a lot of credence in these third-party reports that you see. It\u2019s always amazing to me the cost categories and the components that never seem to make it into the reports, and as I, I think answered in Toni\u2019s questions with the iPhone 4, we have been very aggressive here. This is the best iPhone that we have ever shipped. We are delivering great value to customers, and then has a higher cost structure than the predecessor product, and I don\u2019t want to comment on its specific gross margin.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Okay, Last question for me, back to you, Tim. Just trying to ballpark the size of the supply/demand gap for the iPhone and the iPad, again back of the envelope, are we talking about a couple million iPhone units short of demand and maybe half a million iPads short of demand? Is that the kind of gap we're talking about?\nTim Cook: I don\u2019t know. You know, that question is very difficult to answer because the way that you truly find out what it is at least from my own experience and prospective is you have enough supply to serve the demand, and then you know what the demand is, and today we don\u2019t have enough from either iPhone 4 or iPad, and so I truly don\u2019t know. Obviously we have taken bets internally in terms of the capacities that we are going for and we have rolled those into the guidance that I think you can get from the guidance that I think is extremely strong, but we\u2019re pretty confident that we have been able to pick up the supply.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank: Thanks a lot.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Chris.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks. \nPeter Oppenheimer:  Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are thrilled to report outstanding March quarter results that exceeded our expectations. The strong momentum we experienced in the holiday quarter continued in the March quarter. As a result, we are reporting our best non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings ever, the highest quarterly iPhone sales ever and a new record for Mac sales in the March quarter. We are delivering the best products in Apple\u2019s history and our customers are responding enthusiastically.  Revenue was $13.5 billion, a 49% increase over the prior March quarter\u2019s results. This very strong performance was due primarily to the more than doubling of iPhone sales and the strong momentum of our Mac products. This resulted in a much smaller sequential revenue decline from the December to March quarters than we normally experience. Operating margin was $4 billion representing 29.5% of revenue. Net income was $3.1 billion up 90% over the year-ago quarter and earnings per share were $3.33.  Turning to the details of our results I would like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated record March quarter sales of 2.94 million Macs. This represents 33% year-over-year growth compared to IDCs latest published estimate of 24% growth for the market overall in the March quarter. We were very pleased with Mac sales growth in each of our geographic segments and we experienced strong, double digit growth for both desktop and portable categories.  We made our portable lineup even stronger last week by introducing an updated MacBook Pro line with faster processors, more powerful next generation NVIDIA graphics and even longer battery life. We began and ended the quarter with between 3-4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.  Moving onto our music products we sold 10.9 million iPods, about equal to the 11 million we sold in the year-ago quarter. iPod Touch continued to be very strong with units growing 63% year-over-year. The strong mix of iPod Touch resulted in overall iPod revenue growth of 12%, the strongest iPod revenue growth rate in the last two years. Our share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD. iPod was also the top selling MP3 player and continues to gain share internationally year-over-year in nearly every country we track including high market share countries such as Australia, the U.K., Canada and Japan based on the latest data published by GFK.  The iTunes store delivered its best quarter ever with sales of $1.1 billion due to continued strong demand for music, video and apps. iTunes has the world\u2019s largest online music catalog with a selection of over 12 million songs and in February we crossed the 10 billion mark for songs purchased and downloaded. The App Store continues to be a phenomenal success with more than 185,000 apps and well over 4 billion downloads to date by iPhone and iPod Touch users in 90 countries. We are very excited to have launched the iBook store as well as over 3,500 new apps designed for iPad. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4-6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.  I would now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold 8.75 million iPhones during the quarter, an all-time high exceeding the previous record set in the most recent holiday quarter. This represents 131% year-over-year growth over the previous March quarter\u2019s results and is more than three times the IDCs published estimate of 41% growth for the Smart Phone market overall in the March quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $5.45 billion during the quarter compared to $2.43 billion in the year-ago quarter. The sales value of iPhones alone was about $5.3 billion and dividing this by the 8.75 million units yields an ASP of about $600.  We have continued to expand iPhone\u2019s reach by adding both carriers and countries and we now have iPhone distribution with 151 carriers in 88 countries. We experienced very strong year-over-year growth in each of our geographic segments and particularly in Asia, Australia, Japan and Europe. We were very pleased with the significant sales growth in both existing and new carrier partners. We were also very pleased that customers once again ranked iPhone first in JD Power and Associates\u2019 2010 U.S. Wireless Smart Phone Customer Satisfaction study.  We are also very excited about the release of the iPhone OS4 this summer. Developer response to the beta release and new SDK has been very positive and we believe customers and developers will really enjoy the over 100 new features including multitasking for third-party apps, folders, enhanced enterprise support, the iAd mobile advertising programs and much more.  Turning to the iPad we are extremely pleased with sales results during the past couple of weeks and the critical reviews and customer feedback has been outstanding. Customers are loving the iPad and its revolutionary multi-touch user interface that lets them browse the web, read and send email, enjoy and share photos, watch HD videos, listen to music, play games, read eBooks and much more. We are on track to begin shipping the 3G version of the iPad in the U.S. on April 30th and to begin shipping both versions of the iPad in nine additional countries at the end of May.  I would now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue in the quarter was $1.68 billion compared to $1.38 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%. Our stores sold 606,000 Macs compared to 438,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 38%. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who have never owned a Mac before. We opened two new stores in the U.K. during the quarter as well as a new store in Germany to end with 286 stores. With an average of 284 stores open during the March quarter average revenue per store was $5.9 million compared to $5.5 million in the year-ago quarter.  Retail segment margin was $373 million or 22.2% compared to $317 million or 23% in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 47 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 39.1 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 20%. We also conducted over 700,000 personal training sessions and we ended the quarter with 607,000 members in our One to One program. We remain on track to open 40-50 new stores in total during fiscal 2010 with over half being in international locations including London, Paris and Shanghai.  Total company gross margin was 41.7% which was 270 basis points above our guidance. This difference was primarily driven by several categories of positive factors compared to our forecast. In order of relative impact these were; first, a stronger product mix including more iPhones and accessories. Second, lower cost. Third, fixed cost leverage from the higher than expected revenue in the March quarter as well as a few other small items.  Operating expenses were $1.65 billion and included $194 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was $50 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 24%. We have previously forecasted a 29% tax rate for the full-year but have revised our forecast to about 27% based on a higher mix of foreign earnings. The 24% tax rate for the March quarter was required to true up year-to-date provisions to 27%.  Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $41.7 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $39.8 billion at the end of the December quarter, an increase of $1.9 billion. Cash flow from operations was over $2.3 billion. Our investment priorities for cash continues to be preservation of capital which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.  Looking ahead to the June quarter I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between about $13-13.4 billion compared to $9.7 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 36% down from 41.7% in the March quarter and reflecting approximately $36 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect about 25% of the sequential gross margin decline to be driven by the first quarter of iPad sales.  As we said in January when we announced the iPad we have been very aggressive with pricing and are delivering tremendous value to customers. We think the market for the iPad will be large and we want to capitalize on our first-mover advantage. We expect the remaining three quarters of the margin decline to be due to four factors of roughly equal impact including; a stronger U.S. dollar, our Mac portable transition, the beginning of the education buying season and future product transitions.  We expect OpEx to be about $1.83 billion including $185 million related to stock based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $45 million reflective of the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 27%. We are targeting EPS in a range of $2.28 to $2.39 compared to $2.01 in the year-ago quarter.  In closing, we are thrilled with our record March quarter results and the momentum of our business. We are very pleased with the market share gains for our iPhone, Mac and iPod products and with the tremendous customer response to iPad. We are looking forward to the release of both iPad versions in nine international countries at the end of May and we are very enthusiastic about iPhone OS4 arriving this summer. We are very confident in our new product pipeline and are excited about the months ahead.  With that I would like to open the call to questions. \nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Gene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray. \nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray : It is clear the iPad is off to a fast start. Based on our work it looks like it has the potential to become the Mac of the masses, if you will. My question is what insight did you gain in the last three weeks in the U.S. market in terms of gauging what the impact of the iPad has been on the demand for the overall Mac and has there been any cannibalization? I would guess there is some data somewhere that would give us some insight into answering that question. \nTimothy Cook :  If you look at last quarter we made the announcement as you know of the iPad in January. In our view the last quarter there was no obvious impact on either the Mac or the iPod but you can look at the numbers we are reporting and judge that for yourself. Going forward now that we are selling into April we really don\u2019t have enough experience to come to a judgment yet. We will see how it goes. We are obviously thrilled with the sales of the iPad. They have far exceeded our expectations and it has been a relative great start. \nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray : Throughout the March quarter if you were to look on a month-to-month basis based on some of the third-party data we saw a deceleration in the growth rate of Mac in the month of March. Do you think any of that could have been attributed to people holding off on buying a Mac for an iPad and what would you attribute that step down in the month of March to? \nTimothy Cook :  If you look at the previous March, the base quarter you are comparing to, we announced a new iMac and a new Mac Mini. So our compare point was to a month we announced two new products versus a month we didn\u2019t announce any new Macs. I wouldn\u2019t think you could really judge the Mac business on a month-by-month basis. I think looking at a longer period of time is correct. Certainly, our internal expectation was that the comparable would come down through the quarters and begin to comp against those products. \nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray : On the mix between 3G versus WiFi any sort of flavor you can give us on how to model that out. \nTimothy Cook :  Honestly it is too early to tell. We have only been selling WiFi other than the pre-orders and we feel we really need to be selling both models side by side in an unconstrained environment before we are able really to know what the mix will be. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital. \nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: I wonder if you could talk about your guidance and a follow-up. You talked about the many margin hits sequentially. Can you talk about revenue? For example you have the iPad which you have never had before which should help sequentially. Usually Mac is up in the June quarter sequentially and obviously the iPod are usually maybe down a little. Can you talk about the puts and takes sequentially? Is there something going on with the iPhone where there is a transition that hits that sequentially and that is why you are guiding down revenue sequentially? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We are thrilled with the performance of our business and to be providing guidance year-over-year for growth of 34-38% for the June quarter. In coming up with that we factored several points into the guidance including sequentially lower ASPs from the beginning of the education buying season, a stronger U.S. dollar and product transition. We have also factored in sequentially lower iTunes which is typical as holiday gift cards are used in the March quarter and also sequentially lower accessory and software sales. For Mac we would expect to see a sequential increase in Mac unit sales as a result of the beginning of the education buying season and a recent refresh we just did in the Mac Pro line.  For iPod our in-stock in the March quarter was better than last year which helped us achieve the 10.9 million units. This year we would expect to see a bigger sequential decline in the June quarter than the 7% we saw last year. For iPhone we don\u2019t have much experience with seasonality with our current country and carrier distribution. We are very confident in our product but we will see what occurs and we will report to you in July. For iPad we are thrilled with customer response to the iPad and we will begin shipping both the WiFi and WiFi 3G versions in the U.S. by the end of April and 9 additional countries by the end of May.  We feel very, very good about the start of iPad. \nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: I wanted to hear more about iPhones. Why was it so good? The number was actually frankly staggering due to the expectations in my opinion. There seems to be good strength overseas. Can you talk about why, what happened there and how was China and also channel inventory? \nTimothy Cook :  That is a lot. On the channel inventory our channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning of this quarter compared to the end of the quarter. If you look in terms of geography we had some staggering growth rates as you mentioned. If you look at Asia Pacific as an example the iPhone units in Asia Pacific grew 474% year-over-year. Japan grew 183%. Europe grew 133% and so these are some fabulous numbers we are seeing just incredible demand for iPhones. Some of this was led by adding eight carriers in some key countries.  For example Vodafone in the U.K. and Ireland as well as some other carriers in key countries in Asia. We also had very strong performance from existing carrier partners really around the world. It was widespread and just generally terrific results. \nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Did China meet your expectations? \nTimothy Cook :  China has been interesting. If you look at greater China which we define as mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the iPhone units were up year-over-year over 9 times. We added another 800 points of distribution in China. The revenue, we have never released this number before but I will do this in this particular case, through the first half of the fiscal year that we just completed for the six month period our revenue from greater China was almost $1.3 billion and this is up over 200% year-over-year. So we are well pleased with how the company is positioned to take advantage of the growth in greater China. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross - Cross Research. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Could you talk a little bit about data points for the success of the App store? And how you are thinking about the App Store with the addition of the higher ASP apps related to the iPad? \nTimothy Cook :  We are thrilled with the App store and customers are loving it. It has seen well over 4 billion downloads from the App store and have over 185,000 apps and now over 3,500 for the iPad alone. We have just begun shipping the iPad. Early in the first week we released some data about customer downloads related to the iPad. They are clearly loving it and I think it is a very strong part of the overall product offering to customers. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Can you talk a little bit about your production capacity on the iPad side? Clearly you pushed out, because of demand in the U.S., you pushed out your international launch. How are you feeling about your ability to produce there? How quickly can you ramp up production? Are there any [gating] factors with any commodity components or anything like that? \nTimothy Cook :  We have done very well versus our planned capacity. There is not a production problem. It is sort of a good kind of issue to have that the demand in the U.S. was much, much stronger than we predicted and so regrettably we had to push out the international launch to be able to launch the 3G unit in the U.S. and to get the WiFi units into the United States. We are adding capabilities. We will see where this thing goes but it has shocked us the level of demand at least initially. We will see what happens from here. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Bill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse.\nBill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse: I may have missed it but I didn\u2019t hear you comment on component pricing in your gross margin outlook. Can you give us a sense of what you are seeing in terms of the component pricing trends and where you are seeing any signs of pressure or easing? \nTimothy Cook :  The DRAM market is constrained. We do expect higher pricing sequentially as a result of that. The bulk of the other commodities including the key commodities of [demand] and LCD and HD we see generally in-supply demand balance. Other components we expect to decline consistent with historical trends. \nBill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse: I know it is still early stage here or actually pre-stage but can you help us understand how we should think about the economics of the iAd business. Is it a potential profit center or are you looking at it as a break-even type of business like iTunes and the App Store? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We are putting our toes in the water but don\u2019t expect much from us this calendar year. We think we will learn a lot and build a foundation for the future. \nBill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse: Can you give us an update on where you think AT&T is with its network improvement plans and are you still comfortable that the performance of the network will be up to par this year? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  I think they continue to work very, very hard and we look forward to continued improvement. They clearly made big strides in some areas with some of the recent surveys have pointed out and I think it will continue. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: You kind of alluded to the growth from new carriers versus existing carriers. I don\u2019t know if it might be possible for you to quantify how much of the year-over-year growth came from new carriers or what percentage of the units were contributed by carriers you did not have one year ago? \nTimothy Cook :  We don\u2019t break it out at that level of detail. I would tell you both were very important to us. Both the additions and the existing carriers. You can look at the number of carriers we added which was eight as I had mentioned, and out of the 151 carriers at the country level it is a good number but not a significant number. Obviously the existing carriers performed very well in addition to the adds. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Taking that one step further, can you update us on your thinking about incremental distribution for the iPhone? A couple of calls ago you talked about not really believing in exclusive distribution and really trying to broaden distribution as quickly as possible. I think on the last earnings call it almost seemed like you had softened that and said look there may be regions where we actually don\u2019t care to operate beyond one carrier at our choice. Can you update us on your thinking about incremental distribution? How important is it? Is it available to any carrier in any country? How are you thinking about pricing the device for incremental distribution? \nTimothy Cook :  Let me see if I can word it like this. There are three main countries where iPhones have a contractual exclusive relationship. That is the United States, Germany and Spain. There are a few smaller countries where we have an exclusive or co-exclusive but those three are the ones that are the major markets. Over the past year we have moved a number of markets from exclusive to non-exclusive. In each case as we have done that we have seen our unit growth accelerate and our market share improve. But that doesn\u2019t mean we view that formula works in every single case. I would just sort of reiterate what I did last time that this is how we are learning so far. That is the result we have seen so far. We think very carefully about each of these at the country level to conclude what is in our best interest. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Let me just switch to one other topic if I may and Peter I think this is probably for you. Bear with me, I am going to just plug through some numbers. You said gross margin is going to decline 600 basis points sequentially in the quarter that would be due to the iPad. So that is 150 basis point negative impact from the iPad. If you assume the iPad is 10 points lower gross margin than the company average which is way, way lower than most third-party tear-down services which it would suggest it basically means for that contribution to be true for your guidance iPad would need to be 15% of your revenue or $2 billion. So either iPad is going to be more than $2 billion in terms of revenue per your guidance for next quarter and have a gross margin that is less than 10 points less than the company average or the gross margins of the iPad are more than 10 points lower than the company average.  Can you comment? The math I think is pretty self-evident. Can you comment on whether we should be thinking about this device as having dramatically lower margins than the company average or should we be thinking about this as something that has perhaps a bit more volume than many investors are thinking about? \nTimothy Cook :  Let me comment on the iPad margin first. As you know we don\u2019t give out specific margins for products but really refer to the company gross margin. That said I would point out when we priced iPad we priced it very aggressively in order to deliver tremendous value to our customers. We think the market size for the iPad is very large and we want to capitalize on our first mover advantage. As we have done in other products, although I am not forecasting it, you can see we have a good track record of writing down the costs per with value engineering and volume manufacturing or at least that has certainly been our experience with other products. Those are the things I would point out. Peter do you want to add something to that? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  No, that is definitely our view. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: But the implication of writing down the costs would be unless you pass that on in the form of much lower prices your margins are going to get better. I gather that statement suggests to the degree you want to drive volume you are going to be open minded about price changes? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We have nothing to announce relative to those things today. I am just saying that we have a great product. We have seen great demand. We have priced this extremely aggressively and we did that because we believe there is a huge market for it and certainly the initial results suggest that is the case. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup. \nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: You talked about the headwinds on gross margin going into the second calendar quarter. In the spirit of balance I was hoping you might be able to talk about what you might consider tailwinds on gross margin going into June? In particular whether you would consider component pricing overall to be a headwind or a tailwind in the June quarter sequentially? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  I don\u2019t really consider component pricing to be a headwind or a tailwind. Tim I think answered in Bill\u2019s question his view on what we were going to see in the June quarter. So [costs] are by themselves necessarily a big factor. I think what we think is going to occur in the June quarter is we have introduced a new product that we couldn\u2019t be more excited about. We have been very aggressive and we will take advantage of our first-mover opportunity here.  Then we have some other transitions. We have a stronger dollar and we are heading into the Ed buying season which we anticipate being competitive this year. So that is really what has gone into our thinking on gross margin. \nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: I wanted to ask you about the accounting treatment for the iPad. Whether you could give us a sense of whether you are going to be deferring a portion of the revenue associated with iPad software upgrades or whether you are going to be charging for those upgrades? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We will discuss that with you on our July conference call when we report the June quarter results which will include our first shipments of iPad. \nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup:  Could you talk about the performance of your China stores in particular and your plans for additional store openings in China this year? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Sure. We are very excited about China not only for retail but for Apple. Tim talked about the success we have had in greater China to date with revenue being up about two time\u2019s year-over-year. With regard to retail stores we will open two stores in Shanghai this summer and with targets of having about 25 stores open in China by the end of calendar 2011. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Maynard Um \u2013 UBS. \nMaynard Um \u2013 UBS: If I look at your iPhone units across your 151 operators it is roughly about 58,000 units per operator. Understanding some operators are smaller and others larger, can you talk about the dynamic there and how you drive those units up more materially on a per operator basis? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  The 58,000 to be honest with you is not a very meaningful number because the variance is from one particular carrier that does a few million to some that do very, very low numbers. So the average itself isn\u2019t very meaningful. The things we do to drive overall iPhone demand is focus on product innovation. That is software that hopefully you saw with the preview we gave with new iPhones that will be coming this summer is new hardware and new products. It is new distribution points. It is additional carriers and geographic expansion which we will continue to do. It is really all of those things and great marketing. \nMaynard Um \u2013 UBS: Apple has been a little bit more aggressive defending its patent portfolio against infringement. It doesn\u2019t look like we are really seeing an impact here to OpEx. I am curious how we should think about legal expenses relative to your operating expenses? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We have certainly factored into the guidance we have given you for the June quarter and results we have reported for March our legal and other expenses. Whatever we are incurring in that area is included. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Brian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech. \nBrian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech: I guess some of the iPhone upset I was expecting last quarter actually happened this quarter and based on my calculations your international carrier partners probably represented roughly 75% of the mix for iPhone shipments in the quarter. And taking that one step further I think there was roughly 100 basis points penetrated of that international carrier base, call it post-paid sub base of those total carriers, roughly half a billion units. The question is have you learned any lessons with regard to how the international markets have ramped up relative to what you have experienced in the U.S. over the past 2.5 years? \nTimothy Cook :  I think the key thing is the smart phone category specifically is a great market to be in. It has very high growth rates from a market point of view and Apple with the iPhone unit growth of 131% outgrew the market by three times. So we feel great about that. Those numbers were even better outside of the U.S. than inside the U.S. We have learned a number of things and we are trying every day to take everything we have learned and do something better from a product point of view and do something better for distribution and our carrier relationships and so on and so forth. I don\u2019t want to go into each of those on here because I don\u2019t want anybody to copy those. \nBrian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech: With regard to the Apple TV clearly it seems as though you have been very successful attracting additional media content on the iTunes and the App Store platform. I was wondering if we could get an update on ambitions with regard to Apple TV? Clearly broadband is still somewhat lagging in terms of quality of the service I think and cell phone areas need to get better. I wanted to get your thoughts there. \nTimothy Cook :  The units were up for the quarter 34% year-over-year but the absolute number of units are still small and we still classify the product as a hobby for the company. I would just repeat what I have probably said before. If you look at the other markets that Apple is in, the Macintosh competes in a market of 300 million or so units a year. The iPhone competes in a market if you look at all phones of maybe 1.2 billion a year. The iPod competes in a market that has 100 million plus or minus units per year.  So these are enormous sized markets and clearly the market that AppleTV is in is not in our view nearly that large as yet. That is the reason we classify it as a hobby so that no one gets the wrong impression that we have a vision that it is anywhere close to the size of the other businesses. However, a number of us love the product, use the product and we continue to think there is something is something interesting there and we continue to invest in it. \nBrian Marshall \u2013 Broadpoint Amtech:  A final question with regard to the iAds. Do you think this could be a significant source of potential incremental earnings down the road as I think what you offer advertisers is a pretty compelling demographic user base with the information and emotion you are able to convey?\nPeter Oppenheimer :  I think I commented on a prior question, at this point we are putting our toes in the water so we don\u2019t expect much this calendar year. We think we are going to learn a lot and we will work to build a foundation for the future. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: Just wondering why you didn\u2019t see, or whether you expect any touch cannibalization from the iPad and what is your sense for do you think iPad is cannibalizing maybe competitive netbooks?   \nTimothy Cook : I can only tell you in the quarter we finished, Q2 we finished in March, although we announced the iPad in January there was nothing obvious in the iPod number or the Mac number to suggest cannibalization. There is an obvious announcing and people know it is coming and it is starting to sell. So that part of the equation we don\u2019t know yet. We will find out. We are thrilled with how the iPad is selling and the enormous response that we have received. We also announced net MacBook Pro that you probably saw last week and the whole line change. So we are also happy about how the Mac business is positioned and the level of product innovation in those notebooks. It is enormous. It is taking battery life up to 10 hours. That is absolutely amazing.  In terms of the iPad competing for customers who are considering a netbook, you know I am the wrong person to ask that. To be it is a no-brainer. iPad/Netbook, it is sort of 100 to zero. I can\u2019t think of a single thing the netbook does well. iPad does so many things very, very well. I am already personally addicted to mine and couldn\u2019t live without it. So I am probably not the right person to ask that question.  \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets:  You talked about you see it as a huge independent category and given all the public debate over its positioning which you obviously have some strong views on can you elaborate on why it you see it as a huge independent category given it is a new market, you just sort of listed off a lot of markets that are pre-existing. But you stated in this case you also feel [inaudible]. Why do you think Apple\u2019s approach will outpace of that of big competitor tablets or vertical devices like ebooks? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  I think we did extremely well as usually in positioning the product in the January announcement when he talked about if a product category were to exist between the notebook and Smart Phone then it would need to do something better than either of those. I am just saying from my personal use there is a variety of things I would put on that list and I love notebooks personally but I would put email on it. I would put browsing on it. Listening to music. Watching videos. Watching TV shows of any type. Reading books. The list goes on. Of course you have the entire App store and the ecosystem built around that and so people that like to play games now they have that larger handbook to play games on and other apps from serious apps to less serious apps the larger handbook provides the artist a lot more room to do things that are very cool.  I think it is a new category and certainly it is early but we really, really like what we see right now. We had what we thought were high hopes and it exceeded those. That is all I can offer for now. I would love to talk to you in July and tell you how the quarter went for the June quarter. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Katie Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley. \nKatie Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley : In a previous question you walked through some of the incremental demand drivers for the iPhone. The one you left out was price because Apple along with the carriers has done a good job lowering the price of the hardware over the last couple of years. But with the low end at $99 it seems the incremental demand from here would come from more affordable monthly service plans. So I guess my question is whether Apple has any influence via the carriers to get more aggressive on the total cost of ownership for the iPhone? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We do everything we can to try to get the best deal possible for the consumer. By the way I feel like each of the carrier partners we have worked want to do the same. I think everybody is focused on that. When we dropped the subsidized price of the phone to $99 last year we were actually surprised that the mix to the 3G was very, very high. As you know, that was at $199. I think it is important. I think that price is important on the device but I think there are other things people really want like an extremely innovative product and all the apps and the ecosystem and the great OS and incredible hardware we have got. I think it is one of the factors. \nKatie Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley : As a follow-up on the discussion around margin for iPad, either one of the upside drivers of revenue and margin for the iPhone has been the aftermarket sale of things like accessories. What have you considered about attach rates to the iPad relative to what you have seen on iPod and iPhone and could that maybe be an upside driver to gross margins for that portfolio over time? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  The accessory portfolio is good for us. Over 5,000 accessories that work for the iPhone and iPod largely work for the iPad. We have come out with some great accessories for the iPad in the first weeks and the developer community has rallied around it as well. Let\u2019s give it a little time and presumably some great things will happen there just like it has for iPhone and iPod. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets. \nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : I wanted to ask about retail. In your same store sales comments I think retail on same store sales were up about 7% and total retail was up about 22% in terms of revenue. Therefore, as investors look out is the retail number really driven by new store openings or is there something unusual that was going on? If you could give a little bit of color of the drivers of the retail business that would be great. \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Sure. Our retail stores had a great March quarter. The average increase of revenue per store was actually up 8% and this was the best we had seen in six quarters. The Mac did incredibly well in the stores, up 38% overall. Same store Mac sales were up over 20%. Phone did well. I think the stores are really going to be a great place for customers to come in, look at and buy iPads. We are very confident in our retail stores. The experience it is giving customers and finally just after 10 years of retailing we are just ecstatic about the fact that roughly half of the Mac sales that occur each quarter are to people that have never owned a Mac before. \nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Right but the data has been fairly consistent that the revenue growth in retail at least that category is dependent upon new store openings. \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Again, the average store was up 8% and in the quarter our average revenue was $5.9 million. So if you annualize it that is incredibly high by retail standards particularly for the size of store we have. I would say good growth coming not only from new stores that we open but the stores that we have had open for a number of years are performing very, very well for us and cash flow from those stores is quite strong. \nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : I wanted to ask one follow-up if I could. I know Rich had asked about the iPad. Could you at least let us know where that will be categorized as a line item? Will it be independent or included in something else? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Sure. We are going to report the iPad very similar as we do iPhones. It will be a line item on our data summary and the revenue we report will be for the iPad units and the iPad specific accessories. Again, similar to what we do for iPhones. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Yair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer.  \nYair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer: Recognizing the iPad is still in very much in early days but have you been able to pick out anything about the apps performing? Are consumers buying different kinds of apps than they typically have for the iPhone and is the ASP panning out to be different than the types of apps people bought for the phone to this point? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  It is very early days. We put out some information after the first couple of days. Customers are loving the iPad. They are going to the App Store and getting apps, getting books. It has been really a great thing for customers but we will talk more in the future about how that goes. I would say we are not focused on trying to make a lot of money on the App Store as we haven\u2019t on the iTunes store. We have run the store just over break-even and we just want to offer tremendous value to customers. \nYair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer: Europe appears to be performing exceptionally well. Can we finally say you are seeing a halo effect from the iPhone there? To what extent has that been playing out at the stores? Are more than 50% of Mac buyers in European stores new to Mac? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We tend to not break it down by country but I can tell you we are thrilled with our new to Mac all over the world. \nYair Reiner \u2013 Oppenheimer: You mentioned $600 ASP for the iPhone. Does that include the ratable revenue from software or is that purely for the hardware? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  It is based on the sales value of the iPhone so it doesn\u2019t include anything from carrier payments, any of the deferral or accessories. So it is the sales value in the quarter of the handset sales. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan. \nMark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan: Earlier you mentioned that Apple was shocked about the reception in the U.S. for the iPad. Can you talk about how you are shocked in terms of customer penetration? Are there any customers in the early days that are taking the iPad that are completely new to Apple? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Of course. The numbers right now are so preliminary and based on such a small amount of time we don\u2019t read a lot into those. So they are not something we would disclose at this point. \nMark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan: Not too far beyond the iPad but in the prepared release you said there are other extraordinary products in the pipeline for this year. Are those incremental categories similar to the iPad or are they just enhancements of existing products? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We are just not going to help our competitors so that is not a question I can specifically answer for you. Let me reiterate we are very confident in our new product pipeline and are very excited about the coming months. \nMark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan: In terms of the education vertical as far as the commentary around the margin hit for June, how much of that is driven by competitive dynamics versus maybe just your own ability here to try to cough up demand because of the troubles facing some of the school districts out there? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  You read the same things we do about the state budget situations and the school districts are under a lot of pressure in pretty much every state around the country. I have seen no evidence we are losing market share in education and so I think it is really just a budget issue. We have now entered in the June quarter the education buying season. June tends to be more dominated by K-12 and then September will be more dominated typically by higher ed. This year we expect it to be competitive but we are going to put on our uniforms, suit up and we look forward to competing. \nNancy Paxton : Thank you Mark. Thanks to everyone for joining us.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks. \nPeter Oppenheimer:  Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are thrilled to report our best quarter ever. We posted Apple\u2019s highest quarterly revenues and earnings and set new records in sales of Macs and iPhones.  We are shipping the best products in our history and customers love them. Today we are reporting our current results as well as all historical comparisons under the new accounting principles we discussed with you on our last earnings conference call which I will explain in detail after going through the highlights of our record breaking December quarter.  Revenue for the quarter was $15.68 billion, growing 32% from the prior December quarter\u2019s results and surpassing our previous quarterly record by almost $3.5 billion. Operating margin was Apple\u2019s highest ever at $4.73 billion representing 30.1% of revenue. Net income was $3.38 billion, up 50% over the year-ago quarter and was almost $850 million higher than our previous quarterly record. Earnings per share were $3.67.  Turning to the details of our results, I would like to begin with our Mac products and services. We generated record Mac sales of 3.36 million, beating our previous record set in the September quarter by over 300,000. Quarterly Mac sales grew 33% year-over-year and this compares extremely favorably to IDC\u2019s latest published estimate of 17% growth for the market overall in the December quarter. We are extremely proud of this result and believe our Mac hardware and software are providing outstanding innovation and value that our customers really love.  Response to the new iMac introduced in October was very strong contributing to 70% year-over-year growth in desktop sales. Customers are thrilled with the iMac\u2019s tremendous new features, including enhanced performance, wide screen LED display, wireless keyboard and new magic mouse. Portable sales were also robust during the quarter increasing 18% year-over-year based on strong sales of both MacBook and MacBook Pro.  We experienced very strong demand following the October launch of the new MacBook, which features a durable, unibody design, brilliant LED display, glass multi-touch trackpad and enhanced performance. The new iMac and MacBook launches fueled very strong results in our education business during the quarter. Overall Mac sales through our US education channel increased 16% year-over-year as we set new December quarter records for both K-12 and higher ed channels. We began and ended the quarter with between 3-4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.  Now I will turn to our music products. We sold almost 21 million iPods compared with 22.7 million in the year-ago quarter. As expected, sales of our traditional iPods declined year-over-year but the very strong 55% year-over-year growth in sales of iPod touch resulted in an overall iPod ASP increase of 9% and revenue growth of 1%. Our share of the US market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod was the top selling MP3 player and continued to gain share internationally year-over-year in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.  The iTunes store delivered a record breaking quarter with strong sales of music, video and apps. iTunes has the world\u2019s largest online music catalog with a selection of 11 million songs. iTunes also features over 8,000 Hollywood films including 2,000 in HD video, 10,000 music videos and over 50,000 TV episodes. The App Store continues to be an unparalleled success with more than 3 billion downloads to date by iPhone and iPod touch users in 77 countries. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4-6 weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-forward basis.  I would now like to turn to the iPhone. We are thrilled to have sold over 8.7 million iPhones during the quarter which is a new company record and an increase of 100% over the prior December quarter. This compares extremely favorably to Canalys\u2019 latest published estimate of 35% growth for the smartphone market overall in the December quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset sales, accessory sales and carrier payments was $5.58 billion during the quarter compared to $2.94 billion in the year-ago quarter. The sales value of the 8.7 million iPhones sold in the quarter was over $5.4 billion resulting in an ASP of about $620.  We added 17 new carriers during the quarter including Canada Bell and Telus, Orange in the U.K., China Unicom and KTF in South Korea. We now have iPhone distribution in 86 countries and we are very pleased with the international growth we achieved as we have added both countries and carriers. We experienced very strong year-over-year growth in a number of major markets including Japan, Australia, the U.K., France and Germany.  Satisfaction and demand for the iPhone in the corporate environment remains strong. In fact, business customers have ranked iPhone the number one smartphone in JD Powers\u2019 Customer Satisfaction Survey for the second year in a row. We have continued to see a rapidly growing number of enterprise CIOs who have added iPhones to their approved device list. Specifically we now have over 70% of the Fortune 200 deploying or piloting iPhone. This penetration has doubled since the iPhone 3GS first shipped this past summer.  I would now like to turn to the Apple Retail stores. Revenue in the quarter was $1.97 billion compared to $1.75 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 13%. Our stores sold a record 689,000 Macs compared to 515,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter. About half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.  We opened 10 new stores during the quarter including the spectacular new stores at the Louvre in Paris and on the Upper West Side in New York bringing us to a total of 283 stores in 10 countries. We also completed 32 store remodel projects during the December quarter bringing us to 100 remodels in the calendar year. With an average of 278 stores open during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $7.1 million compared to $7 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment margin was $481 million or 24.4% up from $409 million or 23.4% in the year-ago quarter.  We hosted a record 50.9 million visitors in our stores during the quarter compared to 46.7 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 9%. We also conducted 586,000 personal training sessions and sold 280,000 memberships to our one-to-one program. We now have 52 [ph] stores outside the US and we are on track to open 40-50 stores in fiscal 2010, at least half of which we expect to be in international locations. We remain very pleased with the performance of our stores and customers continue to truly value the great experience our stores provide.  Total gross margin was 40.9%. Operating expenses were $1.69 billion and included $168 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was $33 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 29% better than we expected due to a higher mix of foreign earnings.  Turning to cash, our cash plus short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $39.8 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $34 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of $5.8 billion. Cash flow from operations was about $5.8 billion. Our investment priority for the cash continues to be preservation of capital which has served us well in the current environment. We are continuing to focus on short-dated, high quality investments and remain comfortable with our investment portfolio.  As we discussed on our last conference call, in September 2009, the FASB amended the accounting standards that determine how we account for sales of iPhone and Apple TV, as well as certain other types of transactions related to revenue recognition arrangements with multiple deliveries. We elected to adopt these new accounting principles on a retrospective basis in the December quarter. Because we began selling both iPhone and Apple TV in fiscal 2007, we retrospectively adopted the new accounting principles as if the new accounting principles had been applied in all prior periods.  Consequently, the financial results of each quarter from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 have been revised. We believe retrospective adoption provides analysts and investors the most comparable and useful information and better reflects the underlying economic performance of our business. Under the old accounting principles, we were required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription accounting because we indicated we might provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge.  Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight line basis over 24 months, which resulted in significant amounts of deferred revenue and deferred costs on the balance sheet. The new accounting principles require us to account for the sale of each iPhone and Apple TV as two deliverables. The first deliverable is the hardware and software provided at the time of sale. The second deliverable is the right to receive future, unspecified software upgrades and features when and if they become available.  The new rules require us to estimate the standalone selling price for the software upgrade right and to recognize that amount ratably over our estimated 24 month life for iPhone and Apple TV. For all periods to date from 2007 we have estimated the selling price of the upgrade right to be $25 for iPhone and $10 for Apple TV. The difference between the total iPhone or Apple TV sales price and the $25 or $10 estimated selling price of the upgrade right is recognized as revenue immediately.  As a result, substantially all of the revenue and all of the product costs, including warranty expense from the sales of iPhone and Apple TV are recognized at the time of sale. Therefore, you will see much less deferred revenue and no deferred cost on the revised balance sheet related to past iPhone and Apple TV sales. The accounting for OpEx is unaffected by the new accounting principles.  The new accounting principles also alter the way we previously accounted for some other aspects of the business, including some education and other shipments and some international carrier payments, none of which were significant. For example, under the old accounting principles, we were required to recognize revenue from certain education sales over multiple years because we could not meet the strict criteria required for immediate revenue recognition. Under the new accounting principles, we are permitted to make estimates of the value of the elements that need to be deferred and recognized over time.  Therefore, in our revised financial statements, a significant portion of the revenue from such transactions has been recognized as of the time of sale. The results of the December quarter as well as the revised results in each of the past three fiscal years reflect the new accounting principles. In addition to filing the 10-Q for the December quarter with the SEC today, we also filed an amended 10-K for 2009 to reflect the retrospective application of the new principles to prior years. To assist analysts and investors in their understanding of the impact of the new principles, we also filed an 8-K today to provide quarterly financial schedules reconciling the application of old and new accounting principles to historical income statements, balance sheet, cash flow from operations, deferred revenue and summary data information. These schedules will also be available later today on our website at Apple.com/Investor.  We are very pleased by the FASB's ratification of the new accounting principles as we believe they will better enable us to reflect the underlying economics and performance of our business and therefore we will no longer be providing non-GAAP financial measures.  Looking ahead to the March quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We will provide a range of guidance for the March quarter under the new accounting principles.  We expect revenue to be between $11-11.4 billion compared to $9.1 billion in the March quarter last year under the new accounting principles. We expect gross margin to be about 39% reflecting approximately $40 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $1.64 billion including about $190 million related to stock based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $30 million reflective of the short-term interest rate environment and we expect the tax rate to be about 29%. We are targeting EPS in a range of about $2.06 to $2.18 compared to $1.79 in the year-ago quarter under the new accounting principles.  In closing, we are extremely pleased with the results of our record breaking December quarter, including our 32% revenue growth and 50% net income growth. We remain focused on delivering the industry\u2019s most innovative products and great value to our customers and we are incredibly excited about our new product pipeline.  With that I would like to open the call to questions. \nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Gene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray. \nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: The Mac was impressive, 33% growth, third quarter consecutive extraordinary [ph] Mac growth rate, I should assume by a combination of new products and a better economy but before the slow down, Macs were growing at 41% in June of 2008. Besides the law of large numbers, is there any reason to think the Mac growth rates won\u2019t continue in these just reported ranges? \nTimothy Cook :  We are thrilled to see the Mac at 33% growth rate. It is about two times the market and so I wouldn\u2019t want to predict what will occur in the future. As you know, we don\u2019t do that other than to give guidance. I would point out that some of the markets that we are in, the Mac group was absolutely spectacular. As an example, Italy, France, Switzerland and Spain all grew at 40% or higher. Australia was up over 70%. China was up almost 100%. So there are some markets out there that we are doing extremely well in, and we will just have to see where it takes us. We believe that we are shipping the best products that we have ever shipped before and are very confident about the pipeline. \nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray:  Regarding AT&T, 40% of your iPhone users are on AT&T by our estimates. Obviously AT&T has had a lot of bad press here recently and obviously that impacts your brand. Can you remind us what the benefits and the virtues of sticking with a single carrier in the US are? \nTimothy Cook :  First of all, AT&T is a great partner. We have been working with them since well before we announced the first iPhone to get it out. I think it is important to remember that they have more mobile broadband usage than any other carrier in the world. In the vast majority of locations, we think that iPhone customers are having a great experience from the research that we have done. As you know, AT&T has acknowledged that they are having some issues in a few cities and they have very detailed plans to address these. We have personally reviewed these plans and we have very high confidence that they will make significant progress towards fixing them. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup. \nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup: I wanted to ask you about gross margin. I know you have switched over the accounting but it looked like under the prior accounting method. your gross margin would have been somewhere north of 37%, which is well above the 34% you guided to on the last call. I was hoping you could, as you usually do give us a sense of the puts and takes on gross margin during the December quarter and for the March quarter as well? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Well, as you know, we are reporting our results for the December quarter today under the new accounting principles, and the guidance we provided as you said was under the historic principle, so the two are not comparable. Let me try and help. Actually I would like to first start with revenue. Our actual revenue of $15.68 billion exceeded the guidance that we gave under the old accounting principles by over $4 billion and roughly half of that was attributed to the performance of the business. We set records for Mac and iPhone shipments, had a great iTunes quarter and by the way iPod touch up very strongly 55%.  The accounting change accounted for the other half of the $4 billion. We focused our attention on converting to the new accounting which was really complex and I am so proud of how hard the finance team and the systems teams worked to accomplish this so quickly after the FASB amended the standards. So we didn\u2019t spend as much time really diving into the gross margin but I can tell you that the December quarter gross margin of 40.9% was a bit better than we expected heading into the quarter due to three factors. The first is we did experience a better commodity environment than we had anticipated. Second, we had better warranty performance and lower freight and duty costs than we had planned and we did benefit from the higher revenue and leveraged some of our fixed costs.  As we go forward to the March quarter, I would expect gross margin to be about 39%, down a little bit sequentially as a result of three factors, all about equal in size. The first is we do expect a higher component environment and some other costs in the March quarter relative to what we saw in December. Second, we will have a very typical seasonal decline in revenue, so we won\u2019t have as much leverage on our fixed costs and we won\u2019t have the benefit of a couple of small one-time items we had in the December quarter not repeating. Finally, the US dollar has strengthened here in the new calendar year from where we were in the December quarter and that is having an impact as well. \nRichard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup:  Could you elaborate on which component prices you expect to be up in the March quarter? \nTimothy Cook :  For this quarter compared to last quarter, we are continuing to see the market is very constrained in DRAM, and we do expect that will drive prices higher sequentially. For the vast majority of the other commodities, it appears to us that the excess inventories that caused prices to fall last year have been depleted and are more in a supply/demand balance. The one exception to that is the 3.5 inch drive which will be supply constrained. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Bill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse. \nBill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse: First of all, a clarification, did the guidance you gave include any impact from unannounced products this quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  I think you are maybe alluding to our event on Wednesday. I don\u2019t have anything to share with you today. So please stay tuned. \nBill Shope \u2013 Credit Suisse: Off of that, now that the iPhone business has been around for several years, could you provide some color on how we should think about the March quarter seasonality? Also could you give us an update on how we should think about channel inventory within the iPhone business? \nTimothy Cook :  First of all, on the channel inventory question, we ended the quarter with approximately 2.7 million units in the channel. I would remind you that includes demos and also includes in-transit inventory that has been invoiced at the carrier and so we probably count that in a more conservative manner than others might. In terms of seasonal, I think Peter will comment on that. \nPeter Oppenheimer :  I will talk about all three of our product areas. For Mac, we would expect to see a sequential decline, which is very typical in the March quarter from the December holiday quarter. For iPod, we certainly would expect to see the same. Given that our expectations of traditional iPod sales will decrease over time, the sequential decline may be a little bigger than we have seen in prior years. We don\u2019t have a lot of experience with iPhone, but are certainly gaining some, and given the quarter ended after Christmas, we would expect to see a sequential decline in the March quarter from December, which is we think very seasonal. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital.\nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Your free cash flow was $5.88 in the quarter if I calculated it right and higher than EPS. Do you see any dynamic that would change the way you are generating free cash flow versus earnings and do you think that will remain the case over the long-term? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Well, the cash generation in the quarter was very, very strong. GAAP earnings under the new accounting, which have a very small deferral for iPhone and Apple TV were just under $3.4 billion and our cash increased by $5.8 billion. Our cash flow from operations was about equal to our total cash generation. That really speaks to the power of our business model and our asset management. To answer your question, I don\u2019t see that changing. We are very, very good with our receivables and inventory management and with payables as well. We have been operating on a cash conversion cycle in a range of about a negative 40 days for as many years as I can remember and I am not looking to see that change. \nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: With regard to the iPhone, could you talk a little bit more about China, in particular did that meet your expectations in the quarter? How is that looking into this year? Do you think you will add more partners over time in that area as well? \nTimothy Cook :  We typically do not disclose units by country, but given the visibility of this one, I will do so. We started selling in China as you know at the very end of October and beginning of November. Earlier this month, we had cumulatively activated over 200,000 units, crossing the 200,000 unit mark. We ramped the point of sales across that period of time to end at about 1,500 by the end of Q1, and we are very, very focused on the quality of the point of sale and customer experience. We would prefer to move slow because we are building the brand for the long-term and we are very much focused on the long-term in that market because we think there is significant potential there.  I wouldn\u2019t want to forecast where sales will go and what we may or may not do from a partner point of view. We are very happy with working with China Unicom. They are an excellent partner for us and I am thrilled we are underway and have got about 2.5 months experience under our belt. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Can you comment on your comfort level with iPhone inventory? You mentioned you expect iPhones to be seasonally down but the channel inventory was up. I know you were kind of below where you wanted inventory to be last quarter. So perhaps you could just clarify is 4-6 weeks the right number? Are you right in the middle of that? How do we think about iPhone channel inventory? \nTimothy Cook :  You are correct. Channel inventory grew by about 230,000 units from the beginning to the end of the quarter to around the 2.7 million level. We are completely comfortable with it. We could have sold a lot more and elected not to because we are managing inventories very tightly. I am not putting a target of 4-6 weeks out there on iPhone. We do have that target on iPod as you know and we have a target on the Mac of 4-5. We ended under the Mac number and we ended within the iPod number despite although we did pull the inventory on the iPod down from beginning to end of the quarter by about 150,000 units.  On the phone, we obviously had expansion through the quarter in terms of the number of carriers we are dealing with within some existing countries and also launched some larger countries like China and Korea and really needed more inventory than we started with. I feel totally comfortable with it. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Any update on litigation, obviously relatively a high profile suit from Nokia. Can you give us an update at all or equally importantly can you confirm that there is no potential material risk to Apple\u2019s financials from litigation expense or settling patent infringement lawsuits going forward? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  As you know, we have a long-standing process of not commenting on pending litigation. \nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: On the gross margin side, I think you are guiding on your new GAAP basis for gross margins to be down from 40% last year to 39% this year. How do we think through that given the iPhone gross margins are 60%. iPhones just grew [ph] 100%, year-over-year growth is going to be very strong. So you are going to have a huge mix shift to iPhone. How do we reconcile the notion on a year-over-year basis that overall company gross margin should be going down given that mix shift? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  As I commented before, it is very difficult for us to talk about gross margin on a year-over-year basis because we are in different product cycles, different commodity cycles, currency and mix could be different and other factors as well. I do see our gross margin coming down a bit on a sequential basis form where we ended the December quarter and I can go back through that if you want but I answered that in Rich\u2019s question. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Charles Wolf \u2013 Needham & Co. \nCharles Wolf \u2013 Needham & Co. : The iPhone application approval process has come under constant criticism for delays and reportedly arbitrary guidelines for acceptance. First, is the problem the model itself where Apple acts as the gatekeeper or is it the implementation of the model? Second, have you received any feedback from iPhone owners who shop at the store? Would they also prefer an alternative? \nTimothy Cook :  I think it is important to keep this in some perspective that we have over 100,000 apps on the store and that over 90% of the apps we have had have been approved within 14 days of submission. We created the approval process to really make sure that it protected consumer privacy, safeguards children from inappropriate content and to avoid apps that degrade the core experience of the phone. Some types of content such as pornography are rejected outright. Some things like graphic combat scenes and action games might be approved but with an appropriate age rating. Most of the rejections however are actually bugs in the code itself. This is protecting the customer and the developer to a great extent because they don\u2019t want customers unhappy with the app. So I think what you have here is something that the noise on it occasionally may be much higher than the reality with over 90% approved within 14 days I think is pretty good. \nCharles Wolf \u2013 Needham & Co. : On the second question, have you got any feedback from the iPhone owners who buy at the stores and are they comfortable and happy with it? \nTimothy Cook :  I have not. In the research I have seen from our team I don\u2019t see it in the research. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Mike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: In view of the fact you did indicate in your release and I think probably everybody except some folks on the moon know you are going to be unveiling something exciting soon, how do you feel maybe about sort of new product category opportunities ahead? Can you see things that are as large an opportunity for Apple as has been the iPhone, the iPod and the Mac? Or is that perhaps setting expectations too high? \nTimothy Cook :  I wouldn\u2019t want to take away your joy of surprise on Wednesday when you see our latest creation. So I will delay that for Wednesday. \nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets: When we see your latest creation will you perhaps give us visibility to things like whether it is in your guidance or not or so on and so forth to help us understand a little bit better how to think about how things will unfold from an analyst and investor point of view? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Stay tuned. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Katie Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley. \nKatie Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley : I want to revisit the discussion on China and emerging markets from a broader perspective because these regions tend to share characteristics that are very different than the mature markets where you have had lots of success, particularly the percentage of customers that purchase phone service on a prepaid basis, lower average income levels, etc. As you think about those barriers, is it appropriate to rollout iPhone and other products and pricing and distribution in a homogenous or global way or might you down the road have to look at it on a country by country or region by region basis? \nTimothy Cook :  We have just really got going in China. I really like what I see so far. Although the average income is not nearly as high as perhaps the United States and some other western European markets, there is a significant size middle class and up there. I think to do a real deep analysis, you really have to look not just at the averages but at the distribution of income within these countries. We have been selling in Brazil for a while and are learning about Brazil as well. The Brazilian economy is different than the Chinese economy because the duties are very significant and the taxes are very significant there which tends to compound the price.  But we are very focused on these markets. In fact, if you look at greater China last quarter, which is China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, our revenues tripled year-over-year in that geography which is I think phenomenal by any measure. We have a tremendous focus on it. As was alluded to earlier in the call, 58% of our revenue last quarter was from outside the United States and it is clear as you can look at our numbers our growth rates are much higher outside the US. We realize we must do well in these markets to continue to grow. \nKatie Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley : As a follow-up, you mentioned the plans for store openings in 2010 but what are your expectations for non-retail store CapEx? And if it is growing what types of projects should we think about? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We expect our CapEx in fiscal 2010 to be about $1.9 billion. That is unchanged from what we told you a quarter ago. About $400 million of it is in retail and about $1.5 billion not in retail. The areas we are focused on that exclude retail are of course our facilities and infrastructure and some of our systems areas and manufacturing. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross - Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: On the App Store, could you provide more color regarding what you are hearing from developers and customers? What you are seeing in terms of any changes, paid versus free apps? I think you gave a 3 billion download number. You are probably not going to give me an update but how have you seen the success of App Store? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  For competitive reasons, we don\u2019t want to share much of the answers to the question you asked. I am sorry. Again it is for competitive reasons. What I will share with you is we are way ahead of our competitors with over 100,000 apps on our store. That dwarfs anybody we are competing with. We provided many, many great applications with our developers to customers. That is helping us with both iPhone and iPod touch. It was one of the few reasons why iTunes set a record in the quarter. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: A follow-up question, perhaps, you could talk about\u2026you made a comment that your corporate clients that are looking at the iPhone more than doubled. Are people writing specific apps? Is there any anecdotal evidence that the iPhone sales within corporate are helping to drive overall Mac acceptance in the office environment? Is there anything you could give us in terms of sort of your corporate strategy? \nTimothy Cook :  I think it is early to comment on the halo from the iPhone to the Mac. As you know, we did feel strongly that did exist with the iPod. On a corporate basis, the iPhone really saw a significant acceleration of acceptance and exploration after we announced the iPhone 3GS and associated operating system in the mid part of the year. As I think Peter mentioned in some of his opening comments, 70% now of the Fortune 100 are actively piloting it or deploying it. If you look internationally, about 50% of the FT 100 is doing the same.  So there are some\u2026those are some pretty staggering numbers when you think about the time period we have been in the business. It is only 2.5 years. Several of the requests from enterprises really implemented in the June/July timeframe, so we feel great about what is happening there. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of David Bailey - Goldman Sachs. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: For the iPhone, have you seen any change in the financial model when you moved beyond the first carrier in some of the more mature markets where you've had exclusive agreements in the past? \nTimothy Cook :  Primarily, what we have seen in the countries that we have done this in is that the sales are largely incremental as we add carriers. As you know, we have added carriers in the U.K. I think when our market share comes up there you will see a significant change. We have added carriers in France. I am pleased to say the latest GFK numbers for market share in France is over 60% for the October/ November timeframe. We have added carriers in the Scandinavian countries and saw market share increases. I think we will see the same in Canada when we get the market share numbers for Canada.  That is what we have seen so far. However, we have also selected in most cases countries that we thought that would happen in. I don\u2019t want to imply that would happen in every market or that we are headed that way in every market. \nDavid Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Is there something you are doing specifically either on the sales side or on the technical support side to drive higher corporate growth on the iPhone segment? \nTimothy Cook :  We have done a tremendous amount on the product side itself by implementing tons of features in the latest OS for iPhone that several of our enterprise customers had desired. Secondly, we have added sales staff to assist the carrier staff in selling the iPhone in several of the major geographies. So, yes, this is a key focus of ours. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan. \nMark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan: On the longer-term strategy, could you give us an update in terms of the recent acquisitions of Lala and Quattro? How should investors think about Apple\u2019s longer-term strategy? Will it be only content and device driven or could we see more of a services type flavor longer-term? Any help there would be greatly appreciated. On the tax rate, given the increasing contribution to growth from international, should we think about tax rate having downward pressure as we go into the back half of this year? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  I will start with the second question first. We did have a lower tax rate for the first quarter and your tax rate is really the one part of the guidance where under GAAP it is annual. So at this point we expect our tax rate to be about 29% for fiscal 2010 and when I last spoke with you in October we had expected it to be 30%. So yes it is down a point and it is down a point because of a higher mix of foreign earnings. So if foreign earnings were to grow beyond what we had thought about for the year then our tax rate may very well be lower.  In terms of our Quattro and Lala acquisition, we acquired Quattro because we wanted to offer a seamless way for our developers to make more money on their apps, especially those that are providing free apps. We occasionally acquire small companies from time to time for their technology and talent. That is why we do it. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Maynard Um \u2013 UBS. \nMaynard Um \u2013 UBS: We have seen a number of industry revenue forecasts for applications and just given kind of the expected explosive growth there I am just wondering if that is still a break-evenish type of business as you look forward over the next couple of years? A question on the cash, as the economy starts to improve hopefully and we move away from cash preservation, can you talk about uses of cash because it seems like it can fund the M&A and then some solely through cash flow? In particular I am curious about the company\u2019s appetite for share repurchases, dividends, etc. \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We have told you our philosophy on cash. I don\u2019t have a change in that philosophy to share with you today but nothing is forever. Regarding the App Store and the iTunes stores, we are running those a bit over break even and that hasn\u2019t changed. We are very excited to be providing our developers with a fabulous opportunity and we think that is helping us a lot with the iPhone and the iPod touch platform. \nMaynard Um \u2013 UBS: As the revenues start to ramp there, are there any kinds of fixed costs that would grow with it on a like for like basis that would prevent it from being good operating leverage? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  There are some fixed costs but the variable cost structure is high and we are investing a lot in these stores. As revenue grows, we are just continuing to invest more to give both developers and customers the best experience in the world. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : A clarification on the new accounting standard, will there be $25 of deferred revenue going forward on the sale of iPhones as well? I know it is on a look-back basis. \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Let me clarify this for you. I talked about how we are accounting for an iPhone sale in two elements, the first being the initial hardware and software that somebody would buy and walk out of the store with. The second element being the right to receive future upgrades when and if they become available. We have estimated the selling price of that upgrade for iPhone to be about $25. So in terms of what we have done here in the revision of our financial statements we went back and applied a $25 deferral to all iPhones we had sold in the past and a $10 deferral to Apple TV. When you look at all the things we put out today in terms of income statements, balance sheet and cash flow, you will see there is substantially less deferred revenue on those balance sheets and no deferred costs.  We are recognizing the deferred revenue from the $25 deferral each quarter in our balance sheet. So to help you be sure you have your models correct on a go-forward basis, we essentially recognized about $110 million in the December quarter for the $25 we deferred for all the iPhones we sold over the past two years. So we deferred $25 on the 8.7 million iPhones that were sold in the quarter, so that came out of revenue. But then we put in about $110 million from the amortization that occurred from the past few year\u2019s sales. Does that make sense?\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : For you, on Asia Pac and Japan, CPU sales were particularly strong. And moreover if you look at Asia Pac the revenues were about, the year-over-year growth rate was about three times than the CPU units. I just want to try and understand in Japan and Asia Pac, it looks like a pretty strong mix up in terms of computers but also just underlying strength. I wanted to hear if you could offer some color around that please. \nTimothy Cook :  In Japan, what is going on there is the iPhone has been a runaway hit. The iPhone was up over 400% year-on-year during the quarter. So that is what is driving the huge revenue growth you see in Japan. The Mac growth is above market but we believe we can do better in the Mac area in Japan. In Asia Pacific, Asia Pacific is doing an incredible job with the Mac growing 54%. It is our highest performing region in terms of growth. In the iPhone, the iPhone was up over 500% in Asia Pacific. As you probably remember, we talked about China on this call, but we also added Korea during the quarter, and we added several other countries throughout the year after Q1 of last year. iPhone really drove an incredible amount of the total revenue growth you see on the (inaudible) of 140%. \nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : I think you said it but I might have missed it, what revenue and EPS would have been under the previous accounting policy for the December quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  Actually, I did not say that. That is actually not something that we have the time to try and figure out. As I said before, the team did just an amazing job to implement this new accounting within four months of the FASB ratifying it. The comments I made was our revenue of $15.68 billion under the new accounting exceeded the guidance we gave under the old accounting by over $4 billion. About half of that was driven by the amazing performance of the business and the other half was driven by the accounting change. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank. \nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: I wanted to follow-up on earlier questions around mobile advertising in the application store. Specifically I am interested to understand what role if any you expect mobile advertising to have on your business model going forward? Can you characterize the changing relationship you have with Google as they have entered the smartphone space? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  We work with Google in some areas and we compete with them in others. I think mobile advertising is just in its infancy. And with the great folks we have acquired and are going to be working with at Quattro, we look forward to providing our developers with a great opportunity from mobile advertising and that is what we know at this point. \nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Do you anticipate mobile advertising as being a significant revenue earnings contributor going forward or is this primarily a similar strategy as we have seen in iTunes and the App Store to drive demand for your devices? \nPeter Oppenheimer :  No, we are in infancy and I honestly don\u2019t know. We will have to see. We are going to work hard to provide the developers a great opportunity and we will see where that takes us. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: In the Pro segment, could you update us on what you are seeing in the Pro segment since the last call? And as you look at the upcoming year, are you seeing improvement there? And if you do, is it helping the Mac Pro product line or is it helping sales of higher end MacBook Pros and the iMac? What did you see after the quarter, what do you expect? \nTimothy Cook :  We saw a small year-over-year increase in Pro software sales. This is Final Cut, Aperture and Pro Audio space. We use that as a proxy for how many of our Pro machines are being sold in that space. I would still describe that as an economically challenged area currently. I hope we see improvement as we move forward but I am not projecting it. \nBill Fearnley - FTN Midwest: If I can switch gears to education, what are your latest thought there? In the past, you have made comments about the tax revenues and budgets have gotten worse and certainly the headlines have become even worse since the last time we talked to you. What is going on with K-12 that helps you above the problems that are there and in higher ed with declining endowments is the student purchase segment, your focus on higher ed, if you could give us some more color on K-12 and higher ed and what is happening right for you and why it would be helpful? \nTimothy Cook :  The great thing is, and I am talking about the Mac here specifically, was the combination between K-12 and higher ed in the US was up 16% year-over-year and that is the best growth rate we have seen since before the recession began. So we feel great about how we came out of the quarter. We had very few orders that were supported with stimulus funds. I would hope that would change in the future although I don\u2019t know if that will happen or not.  Our whole ed business is based on we really understand teaching and learning and student achievement at a very deep level and we think we are the only technology company that really gets it. So we sell a lot more than just boxes as many other people do. I think with staying very focused on that market, I think we can continue to do well and I was thrilled to see the results we hit last quarter. \nNancy Paxton :  Thanks to everyone for your participation.

Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Apple CEO, Tim Cook, for introductory remarks.\nTimothy D. Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. This is our first earnings call since the passing of Steve Jobs. The world has lost a visionary, a creative genius and an amazing human being. Steve was a great leader and mentor and inspired everyone at Apple to do extraordinary things. His spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple, and we are dedicated to continuing the amazing work that he loved so much.  Only Apple brings together software, hardware and services into such a powerful and integrated experience for our customers. As we move forward, we will continue doing that with relentless focus. I'd like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for all of the condolences and expressions of support that we have received following Steve's passing.  With that, I'd like to turn over the call to Peter to discuss our Q4 results. Peter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Tim. We are very pleased to report record September quarter revenues and earnings. We set a new all-time quarterly record for Mac and iPad sales, and we established a new September quarter record for iPhone sales. We're very proud of these results and with the momentum of our business.  Revenue for the quarter was $28.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 39%. The year-over-year increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad, Mac and iPhone sales. Operating margin was $8.7 billion, representing 30.8% of revenue. Net income was $6.6 billion, increasing 54% year-over-year and translating to earnings per share of $7.05.  Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new all-time quarterly record with sales of 4.89 million Macs, exceeding the previous record set in the last December quarter by 760,000 Macs, representing a 26% increase over the year-ago quarter's results. That is more than 6x IDC's most recently published forecast of 4% growth for the PC market overall in the September quarter. Mac sales increased strongly in each of our operating segments led by Asia-Pacific with growth of 61% year-over-year.  The increase in Mac sales was fueled by the very strong growth in MacBook Air as well as the continued strong performance of MacBook Pro. In July, we updated the MacBook Air with the next-generation processors, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O technology and a backlit keyboard. And while the portables represented 74% of the total Mac mix, we also generated record desktop sales in the quarter primarily due to continued strength of iMac.  We launched Mac OS X Lion on July 20 and customer response has been tremendous with over 6 million Lion downloads during the September quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory.  Moving to our music products. We sold 6.6 million iPods compared to almost 9.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Though down year-over-year, total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continue to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory.  The iTunes Store generated record results with revenue in the quarter of almost $1.5 billion. The iTunes catalog continues to grow, and customers have downloaded over 16 billion songs and 650 million TV shows to date. We've also been very pleased with the growing popularity of the iBookstore with over 180 million downloads of iBooks to date.  I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 17.1 million iPhones compared to 14.1 million in the previous September quarter. This represents 21% year-over-year growth and a new September quarter record. We experienced particularly strong iPhone sales growth in our Asia-Pacific segment where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year.  We were pleased with the iPhone sales growth as we prepared for the transition to the iPhone 4S. We expected iPhone sell-through to decline sequentially from the June quarter as a result of new product rumors following the announcement at our Developers Conference in June that iOS 5 and iCloud would become available in the fall. As we predicted, iPhone sell-through did decline across the quarter especially in the second half as new product speculation intensified.  We ended the quarter with about 5.75 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential decline of about 180,000, which places within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $11 billion during the quarter compared to $8.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 24%.  Given the October launch of the iPhone 4S, we opted to defer new carrier and country additions from this September quarter until after the launch. As we indicated 2 weeks ago, we were very pleased to have recently added Sprint and KDDI to our carrier line up. These additions bring us to 230 carriers in 105 countries. For the sixth consecutive time, iPhone ranked highest in consumer reports, wireless consumer smartphone customer satisfaction survey, achieving the highest ratings for overall satisfaction as well as for performance, ease of operations, features and design.  iPhone continues to be adopted as the standard across the enterprise with 93% of the Fortune 500 deploying or testing the device, up from 91% last quarter and 60% of the Global 500 testing or deploying iPhone, up from 57% last quarter. A recent example of iPhone's enterprise success is Lowe's. Lowe's is in the process of rolling out over 40,000 iPhones with a custom application to allow their store associates to execute realtime inventory checks, product orders and interactive customers with how-to videos.  Additional examples of companies around the world supporting iPhone on their corporate networks include L'Oreal, Royal Bank of Scotland, SAP, Texas Instruments, Jacobs Engineering Group, Tenet Healthcare, Jaguar Land Rover, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Lincoln National and CSX Corporation. And of course, we're thrilled to begin shipping iPhone 4S this month.  We are extremely enthusiastic about Siri, the iPhone 4 intelligent assistant that helps you get things done by just asking, and we think customers will love the performance of the iPhone 4S' dual-core A5 chip, all-new camera and full 1080p HD video recording. Now shipping in 7 countries, we are working hard to get iPhone 4S in customers' hands as quickly as possible. We look forward to rolling it out in 22 more countries by the end of this month.  Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its incredible momentum. We set a new record with sales of 11.1 million iPads during the September quarter compared to 4.2 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 166%. We've said from the beginning that the tablet market is a huge opportunity for Apple, and we are very excited with our current performance and the tremendous customer enthusiasm for iPad.  We launched iPad 2 in additional 20 countries, ending the September quarter with distribution in a total of 90 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter were $6.9 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 146%.  We ended the quarter with about 2.5 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about $1.45 million, which places within the target range of 4 to 6 weeks. It's been just 18 months since we introduced iPad and the pace at which businesses worldwide are adopting this technology is unprecedented. Today, 92% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPad within their enterprises, up from 86% last year. Internationally, 52% of the Global 500 are testing or deploying iPad, up from 47% last quarter.  Every day, we learn about innovative new ways our enterprise customers are using iPad. The airline industry is a great example of the momentum we're seeing. United Continental Holdings is putting iPads in every cockpit to replace heavy, paper-based flight bags. In Japan, All Nippon Airways is now using iPad in training programs for flight attendants.  Sonic Automotive is using iPad for customer check-in at the service department and also to provide analytics to regional managers. Aflac, Biogen and General Mills have developed internal apps that their field sales teams leverage daily, and technicians of Siemens Energy are bringing iPads along when they do maintenance work at the top of their wind turbines.  Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed the 0.25 billion cumulative iOS device sales in the September quarter. We were very pleased to begin delivering iOS 5 last week and customers are loving its many new features, including Notification Center, iMessage, Newsstand and Reminders.  We're also very excited to launch iCloud last week, with breakthrough services including iTunes in the Cloud, Photo Stream and Documents in the Cloud. We believe iCloud is the easiest way for customers to manage their content going far beyond anything else available today and early reviews have been excellent.  The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 500,000 apps available and over 18 billion downloads to date. We expanded the App Store to 33 additional countries during the September quarter, ending with a total of 123 countries.  I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue was $3.6 billion, an increase of 1% over the prior-year quarter. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in Mac and iPad sales, which was largely offset by decline in iPhone sales given the tough comparisons in the year-ago quarter when iPhone 4 was launched and compounded by speculation about a new iPhone this year. The stores generated record-breaking Mac results, with sales reaching 1.1 million compared to 874,000 in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 25%. And about half of the Macs sold in our stores during the September quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.  We opened 30 new stores in the quarter, 21 of which were outside United States. On the last weekend of the quarter, we opened 7 stores in 6 countries, including our first store in Hong Kong. With our highest opening day for Mac sales ever, our Hong Kong store joins our 5 other China stores as the highest traffic and among our highest revenue stores in the world. We ended the quarter with a total of 357 stores. With an average of 336 stores opened, average revenue per store was $10.7 million compared to $11.8 million in the year-ago quarter.  Retail segment margin was $679 million compared to $917 million in the year-ago quarter. Store traffic continues to be very strong. We hosted a record 77.5 million visitors in the September quarter. As we look ahead to fiscal 2012, we will continue to focus on international expansion. In total, we expect to open about 40 stores with approximately 3/4 of them outside United States. We will also be expanding or replacing higher volume stores primarily in the U.S. that are simply too constrained to deliver our desired customer experience.  Total company gross margin was 40.3%, which was 230 basis points higher than our guidance. This difference was almost entirely due to lower component and other product costs. Operating expenses were $2.67 billion and included $253 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $81 million. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.7%.  Turning to cash. Our cash and short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $81.6 billion at the end of the September quarter, compared to $76.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of $5.4 billion. This increase was net of cash paid for the acquisition of Nortel patents and the Nokia settlement during the September quarter. Cash flow from operations was $10.4 billion, an increase of 84% year-over-year.  As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. I'd also like to remind you that approximately once every 6 years, we add a week to the December quarter to align our fiscal periods with the December calendar. So this December quarter will span 14 weeks rather than 13 and will end on December 31.  We expect revenues to be about $37 billion compared to $26.7 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 40%, reflecting approximately $60 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.25 billion, including about $350 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $85 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 24.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $9.30.  In closing, we're extremely pleased with the strong conclusion to our record-breaking fiscal 2011. Over the course of the year, we generated revenue of over $108 billion, an increase of $43 billion or 66% over our fiscal 2010 results. We blew past historical records by selling over 72 million iPhones, 32 million iPads and almost 17 million Macs in fiscal 2011.  We expanded our reach by opening 40 new retail stores, adding scores of new carrier and leaseholder relationships and broadened our online presence through Apple stores and App Stores around the world. And last but not the least, we generated almost $26 billion in net income during the year, an increase of 85% year-over-year, which was even faster than our revenue growth. We're thrilled to begin selling iPhone 4S and to bring iOS 5 and iCloud to our customers this month, and we remain very enthusiastic about our new product pipeline.  With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Bill Shope.\nBill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I have a few iPhone questions if I could. Given that the 4S was launched so close to the holiday selling season, can you give us an idea of your confidence in the production ramp and the distribution ramp and how you've mitigated the risk of a shortage during peak consumer demand?\nTimothy D. Cook: Bill, it's Tim. We've gotten off to a great start with the 4S. We've sold over 4 million in just 3 days after launch, and so we're thrilled with the start that we have. We're confident that we will have a large supply, but I don't want to predict when supply and demand might balance because the demand is obviously extremely high right now. But I'm confident that we will set an all-time record for iPhone this quarter.\nBill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Now and just a question on the September quarter iPhone dynamic. So it sounds like the primary negative impact on shipments was purely from a sell-through pause. You didn't have any real channel inventory drawdown issues affect shipments. Is that correct?\nTimothy D. Cook: Not entirely. If you look at on the sell-through basis, the sequential comparison is down 2.4 million units. That's 19.7 million from the previous quarter, which had an inventory build in it to bring it to a sell-in of over 20 million and to 17.3 million this quarter, which had an inventory reduction of a little less than 200,000, which Peter talked about in his opening remarks. That 2.4 million was much less of a reduction than what we were expecting and was a large factor in our revenue exceeding our guidance by over $3 billion. We expected it to be greater than 2.4 million because we knew that there was great anticipation of the June or July new iPhone because that was the pace that we have been on for the last several years. And as we had predicted, that sell-through decline did occur in the quarter, but not nearly to the extent that we fought and therefore, we significantly beat our guidance. The reduction happened largely in the back half of the quarter as the speculation hit extreme highs. However, we're thrilled to be shipping the new iPhone 4S and iOS 5 and iCloud, and we're very confident that we will set an all-time record in the December quarter for iPhone sales. We -- in our wildest dreams, we couldn't have gotten off to a start as great as we have on the 4S.\nOperator: From Morgan Stanley, we'll hear from Katy Huberty.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Peter, this quarter you were able to print north of a 40% gross margin despite the mix shift away from your high-margin product and towards lower margin products. So just curious why you don't think you can do better than 40% in December given how well the iPhone 4S is already doing and the favorable component cost environment, and then I have a follow-up for Tim.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. I understand your question, Katy. We expect the gross margin to be relatively flat on a sequential basis. And we expect this because as you pointed out, we do think a favorable component cost environment will continue, and we certainly expect a very strong mix of iPhones, both of which are positive for gross margins. However, we expect both of these to be basically fully offset by the impact of higher cost structures and reduced price points for the recently introduced iPhones and iPods as well as the stronger U.S. dollar. It's really strengthened in the last couple of weeks from where we were across the summer. So that's why.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And then Tim, over the course of the last year, you've provided great insight into Apple's traction in China. So I wonder if you could update us on how you're tracking in that region, but also provide some insight into how substantial China could be to Apple over time. For instance, is there any reason that China couldn't be as big as the U.S. market once you open more stores and optimize the product set there?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, thanks for the question. Should the China progress has been amazing, if you look at our Greater China revenue, it represented just 2% of Apple in our fiscal year '09. And in the fiscal year we just ended, it accounted for 12%, and if you just look at the quarter that we just ended, it accounted for 16%. So it's our fastest growing major region by far. It delivered $4.5 billion of our revenue for the current quarter, and that's up almost 4x or about 270% year-over-year. That brought the total revenue for the fiscal year to over $13 billion. And to further put that in context, a year ago in fiscal year '10, we were just right above $3 billion. So it is growing at a feverish pace. We have placed new retail stores there as you know. We now have 6 in Greater China. Our online store opened at the end of last year, and so we have still -- we haven't hit our one-year anniversary there yet. We have over 200 Mono-branded stores that we call APRs, which are resellers on there. That's a very premium shopping experience, and we are now up to over 7,000 point of sales on the iPhone in Greater China. And so we're continuing to make investments in this. How far can it go? Certainly in my lifetime, I've never seen a country with as many people rising into the middle class that aspire to buy products that Apple makes. And so I think it's an area of enormous opportunity, and it has quickly become #2 on our list of top revenue countries very, very quickly and we're obviously placing additional investment. We're building more stores there as well as doing quite a few other things to continue to deliver our great products to the people of China. We're also placing additional focus on some other areas that have shown great promise over this fiscal year such as Brazil. Brazil was up 118% year-over-year and went over the $900 million mark. Russia is also beginning to look more and more promising. As I've mentioned on the last call, the Middle East we believe has significant opportunities. So there's several of these markets that historically Apple has not been strong and that the iPhone has really opened up and introduced Apple to a whole set of customers that didn't get excited about looking at other products that we have. And I think certainly, the iPad will be doing the same. And so I think China, the sky is the limit there, and I wouldn't discount some of these other places that I've mentioned as well.\nOperator: We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.\nMark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Two questions. First for Tim. If you weigh in a little more on Apple's historic strength in terms of manufacturing and supply chain strategies, I know we talked about this before, Tim. But can you give us an update in terms of your margin flexibility as you start to use more than one source for certain parts of your supply chain manufacturing chain? And I have a question for Peter after that.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes. Mark, I think we have an outstanding team in this area and a track record that's unparalleled in the industry. Although we keep trying to improve it all the time, we've also used our balance sheet in a favorable way here to do some strategic deals on different parts that we felt were very, very important to Apple across a series of products. As we get larger, there are some areas where we've elected to diversify some. However, our approach has been and I think will always be to do business with as few people as we can so we can be very deep with them and do great innovative stuff together, and you can't tend to do that when you go out to many, many different people. And I think they give us great quality and also reasonable prices, and so that winds up helping our margin.\nMark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then the second question is around the iPad. Recently, Amazon with the Kindle Fire is trying to make the tablet market more of a soapbox derby in terms of lower price points but maybe limited feature sets. Can you kind of weigh in on what your view is? Is this making more of a hybrid market where it's not really a tablet but kind of a hybrid and Apple has not really seen any effects from a demand perspective at this point?\nTimothy D. Cook: We had an outstanding quarter last quarter with setting a record with doing over 11 million, and at the same time we were setting a Mac record, which is I think very phenomenal in and of itself. But we've seen several competitors come to market to try to compete with the iPad over time. They've had -- some had different form factors, different price points. And I think it's reasonable to say that none of these have gained any traction thus far. And in fact, as all of those competitors were coming to market, our share actually went up such that in the June quarter IDC -- according to IDC, we were responsible for 3 out of every 4 tablets sold. And I think when you really assess this thing and look at iOS 5, iCloud, the ecosystem with iTunes and the App Store and books and movies and the fact that we have over 140,000 native apps for iPad versus a number in the hundreds for the other guys, I feel very, very confident about our ability to compete and extremely confident in our product pipeline.\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.\nCharles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And Peter, did I hear that right that you mentioned the deferral of iPhone for new carriers and new country additions? Wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on what that was and the potential impact on the numbers?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, that's in my prepared remarks. We opted to defer adding new carriers or countries during the September quarter knowing that we would launch the iPhone 4S very early in the October month, and we wanted to launch our new carriers with our latest products so we waited. I think that did have some impact on the September quarter. I think the biggest impact were the rumors that were just very pervasive, particularly in the second half of the quarter. There just seemed to be the rumor of the day. But that's behind us. We have just started selling the iPhone 4S and it's off to a fantastic start, and we're thrilled to be including Sprint and KDDI in our carrier lineup. And we're heading into this holiday season with the best product lineup Apple has ever shipped and tremendous momentum.\nCharles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And Tim, I realized the Amazon Fire question is out of the way here, but do you have any just high-level thoughts on the size of the tablet market? I mean, it's not netbooks. It's computers. I mean, how do you think about, internally thinking about, how big this market could be in the next 2 years?\nTimothy D. Cook: We thought, Gene, from the beginning of this that it would be a huge market, and it has been even greater than we thought. And we've now sold 40 million on a cumulative basis. And it's pretty clear to me that if you forecast out in time that the tablet market -- I still believe it will be larger than the PC market. That's not a guidance number. That's just something that I very much believe. There will be many, many more people that can access it, and the ease of use is so phenomenal and off the charts that I think it's a huge opportunity for Apple across time.\nOperator: From Barclays Capital, we will hear from Ben Reitzes.\nBenjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I was actually wondering if we could talk a little bit more about the iPhone. Just do you have any idea of what -- how many units do you feel were pushed out and deferred into the next quarter? And in general, what do you think -- how should we be thinking about the 4S launch given the pent-up demand from the quarter? And anything else with regard to the velocity and how it worked into your guidance of $37 billion?\nTimothy D. Cook: Ben, I think the number -- you can't run the experiment twice. So we can't tell you with precision how many units we would have sold if there had not been rumors and people weren't expecting a new iPhone. But I certainly believe it was a substantial, and that's the reason that we called it out. And I think anybody monitoring the press would probably come to the same conclusion. You could go out and talk to a group of customers and probably get the same kind of answer. On the 4S, I think it's off the charts. If you do a comparison of the 3 days after launch of last year on iPhone 4, we came in at 1.7 million. This year, we were over 4 million in the same time frame, and so that's the mother of all uplifts. And so we're thrilled with how we've gotten started, and the feedback that we're getting from customers is just fantastic. And so I couldn't be more pleased with where we are.\nBenjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And just my follow-up is with regard to the iPad category, now that it's, I wouldn't call it maturing, but a few more quarters of experience, do you -- generally in Macs, you're up a little sequentially lately in the fourth quarter. You have an extra week now. Any thoughts on how the iPad seasonality may be working in the iPad over the next quarter or 2, just in terms of more experience or gut feel for how that product progresses?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, it's Peter. I'll give you some thoughts on the December quarter but we're not going to provide our thoughts yet for the March quarter. We would expect to establish new company records for both the iPhone and the iPad in the December quarter. These are fantastic products, and the momentum here is tremendous. And for Macs, we would expect to outgrow the market on a year-over-year basis and report to you our 23rd consecutive quarter of outgrowing the market.\nOperator: Shannon Cross with Cross Research Financial.\nShannon S. Cross: My first question. Tim, can you talk a little bit more on how you see Siri and how you see Siri in the future? I mean, is this a feature or do you see it more as a key way that consumers are going to interact with their devices? Just any color you could give would be great.\nTimothy D. Cook: The number of people using it already is amazing, and the questions and so forth and the personality that it has is also incredible. And so we see this as a profound innovation. And I think over time, many, many people will use it in a substantial way. And what percentage of their input will be by that, I don't know. And what percentage of their searches, I don't know. But our guts have been since the beginning of this is that it is substantial and it's an incredible innovation, and that's the feedback that we're getting from customers.\nShannon S. Cross: Okay. Great. And then can you make a comment just on the supply chain given the HDD issues in Thailand? What are your thoughts -- any clarity you've gotten from the people on the ground there?\nTimothy D. Cook: It's a very good question. Our hearts go out to all the people in Thailand who have experienced these devastating losses of life and property as a result of the monsoons and the flooding. Like many others, we source many components from Thailand and have multiple factories that supply these components. There are several factories that are currently not operable, and the recovery timeline for these factories is not known at this point. As you can appreciate, the weather really hasn't allowed an ability to assess those. From the work that we have done, we would say that our primary exposure is on the Mac because as you point out, of the number of drives or drive components that are sourced in or -- Thailand is a significant portion of the total of worldwide supply of drives. And so I can't give you a precise accounting. It is something that I'm concerned about. We do expect -- I'm virtually certain there will be an overall industry shortage of disk drives as a result of the disaster. How it affects Apple? I'm not sure, but we placed our assessment to the degree that we can make one in the guidance that Peter has already given you in the $37 billion number.\nOperator: Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nA.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your ongoing patent disputes most notably versus Samsung and other Android OEMs? Specifically, I'm wondering if you can characterize what your ultimate objectives are from litigation. Is it to get injunctions on violating products? Is it to capture royalty fees? Or what is it?\nTimothy D. Cook: Toni, I don't want to comment on any particular litigation. It's our policy not to do that. But basically as you know, we spend a lot of time and money and resource in coming up with incredible innovations, and we don't like it when someone else takes those. And so that's why we -- unfortunately, we've been pushed into the court system as a remedy to that, but I don't want to comment about any particular lawsuit.\nA.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Just, I mean, generally speaking, you said as a remedy. What kinds of remedies do you see coming from the court system?\nTimothy D. Cook: That's one of the things I particularly don't want to comment on.\nA.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the price reductions on the 3GS offering. You've gone to free on postpaid and dramatically reduced the price $160 to $200 in most countries on the prepaid offering. Do you -- how are you thinking about this price reduction in terms of its potential elasticity? Do you see it as targeting a new segment of consumers? And how are you thinking about whether this will largely resonate with prepaid customers or with postpaid customers?\nTimothy D. Cook: We did it because we wanted to make the iPhone more accessible to a broader market. And so not only did we take the 3GS to free on a postpaid basis and that's the U.S., but it's free on postpaid in many, many other markets as well. But we also lowered the price of the iPhone 4 to $99. And so we've done both of those because as we looked at it, these are still fantastic products, and we think that we can do reasonably well selling those in the postpaid markets. It also has the advantage of having a lower price in the prepaid markets. Obviously not free and $99, but lower than where those entry points were previously. And so we did it for both markets, Toni, both the postpay and the prepay markets. Both of those are very, very important to us, and it has been our thinking for a while to do that.\nOperator: From Citi, we'll hear from Richard Gardner.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Tim, as a follow-up to Shannon's question, I was hoping that you might be willing to give us a more general view of how you view component supply demand and pricing going into the fourth quarter. And then also, particularly unibody casings given the issues that you've had with one of your suppliers in that area as well, do you expect that to have any significant impact on MacBook Pro or MacBook Air supply in the fourth quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: On the second question first, we treat every concern that we hear about our suppliers very, very seriously, and we're currently investigating and assessing the situation. And we factored our supply outlook as we currently see it into the numbers that Peter has given earlier. In terms of the general market for components, NAND and DRAM, which really declined last quarter and LCDs, we see all 3 of these generally in a very positive supply situation and therefore, we expect the pricing to continue at favorable levels. Most of the other components we expect to fall at or above historical trends. And so generally speaking, it's a very positive market from a supply point of view. Now that is with the asterisk of the disaster that just happened in Thailand aside, and I'm not sure how that will play out. But I do believe that the risk there is more focused on the Mac portion of our product line.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And if I could ask a follow-up, I guess, for Peter and Tim. I know you don't give operating margin guidance or gross margin guidance. But it does seem like we could be moving it to a new phase for the company where potentially, several of the fastest growing products in the product line, whether it be iPad or these lower priced iPhones that could see some good price elasticity at the low end, could be the fastest growing products for the company next year and could start to put some pressure on gross margins. I'm just wondering if you, a, agree with that assertion. And b, if that is the case, is it still reasonable to think that the company can maintain or expand operating margins next year if gross margins come under pressure due to product mix?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Rich, it's Peter. Let me make some comments about the December quarter, and then I'll give you more of our philosophy beyond. We're not providing future quarter or future year guidance. For the December quarter, we anticipate our gross margin being about 40% and having nice leverage on OpEx yielding an operating margin of just over 31%, which would be quite strong. As we look forward, we are going to continue to offer the very best products to customers that we can. We are going to be extremely innovative. We're very confident and excited about what's in the product pipeline. You'll see us be aggressive in the future. And where customers want to buy, that's fine with us. We just want them to buy our products. As I look back over the last couple of years, I think we've done a very good job gaining market share and growing our top and bottom lines and running a great business, and we're just going to keep coming to work every day to do that in the future.\nOperator: We'll go to  Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.\nKulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: I've got just one clarification, one question. On the iPad side, could you just speak about where we are on the distribution rollout of that product, in particular, where we are on countries and carriers and point of sales? And was there any pause around that in the September quarter? And then a question for Tim. Tim, you mentioned just the growth not only in China but also the potential that may exist in Brazil and Middle East and Russia, and I guess you could throw India in there as well. What do you practically need to do to actually realize the potential there? Is that a case of local manufacturing in some of those countries? Is it a case of carrier distribution? And how long might it take to realize that? Because I understand the focus now is on China, but I'm trying to understand what Apple needs to do to realize the potential of the emerging middle class in those countries as well.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, we are in 90 countries on iPad. We have about 40,000 points of sale around the world. To put that in some context, we have about 50,000 on iPod and about 120,000 on iPhone. So you can get a feel for the extent of the rollout there. There are still countries left to do, but we are in the main countries with iPad. Do I think there was a slowdown on iPad? Where the iPhone numbers, it's crystal clear in looking at the numbers that there was a slowdown. That is not the case on iPad. And so where I believe we are from a supply-demand point of view on iPad is that we, somewhere during the quarter, entered a supply-demand balance and stayed there for the balance of the quarter. If you recall on the last call, I said that we were coming in balance in a few countries. And then sometime thereafter, I think that we went into a supply-demand balance around the world. And you can look at the share numbers that third parties have reported, and we're doing extremely well there. We feel -- we couldn't feel better honestly. And the extent of the usage, the comScore group said that 97% of the web usage of tablets in the U.S. is from the iPad, so it's just mind-boggling. So we feel very, very good about that. In terms of the other countries outside of China, we have already started placing efforts in the places that I mentioned. It's not something that we are going to start next week or so. It's something we've already done or I wouldn't have brought it up, frankly. Obviously, we wouldn't have done over $900 million in Brazil with no effort. There are some countries in the world that have protectionalist type of structures where the prices of the goods are extremely high if there's not local content involved. And so we'll assess each of those and decide what's in our best interest. But today, I don't have anything to report there. The basic approach in all of the countries are the same as the game plan that we used in China, and it's just a matter of the course, the rate and pace of the rollout and whether to involve every one of the things that we did in China. In China, we picked everything that we knew to do. We are building retail. We went in with an online store. We're building an APR channel. We're building a third-party channel. We're doing significant advertising. We're really doing everything basically that we're doing in the United States, we're doing in China. We would not be doing that in each of the other countries I named, but we would be doing portions of that and have already started to achieve the numbers that we did last year.\nOperator: From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we'll go to Scott Craig.\nScott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Tim, I was wondering first call as CEO, any thoughts on, any different strategy as far as cash allocation goes? And by that, I mean, dividend and a possible share buyback and maybe talk about these supplier investments also. And then the second question is, you mentioned the tablet market potentially being even bigger than the PC market at some point. Can you discuss the cannibalization levels that you think you're seeing right now versus the PC market?\nTimothy D. Cook: Let me start with the second question first. I do believe that we're seeing cannibalization. I think that it's showing up in 2 ways. I think that some people are electing to buy an iPad rather than a Mac. However, I believe a materially larger number of people are electing to buy an iPad instead of a Windows-based PC. And so I think we are overwhelmingly coming out very, very well in that cannibalization question. And I would point out that despite that, the Mac had its best quarter by far ever last quarter. And so even with having the best quarter on iPad with some cannibalizations in Mac, the Mac has its best quarter ever, which is almost unbelievable. And so with cannibalization like this, I hope it continues. On your cash question, to date as you know, we've wanted to maintain flexibility. I think everyone that knows us knows that the cash isn't burning a hole in our pocket and we're not the type of people to do silly things with it. We invest it conservatively. If you look at Gary and his team's track record, they've done a phenomenal job in a extremely difficult market for the last few years. We've also taken money and done things with it that are in Apple's best interest. For example, we've acquired several companies. We've acquired some IP as you know. We've invested in the supply chain, and we used money to build out our stores and provide for a lot of new product tooling and the like. And so I believe what we're doing with cash, the way we're -- this cash that we do spend we're doing an extremely good job of it and we're very frugal about using it and using it in the right places. That said, I'm not religious about holding cash or not holding it. I'm religious about a lot of things but not that one. And so we will continually ask ourselves what's in Apple's best interest and always do what we believe is in Apple's best interest. And so it's a topic for the board on an ongoing basis, and we'll continue to discuss it.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Scott, I'd like to add to Tim's answer, just to remind everybody that of the little over $81 billion of cash that we ended in the September quarter with, a bit more than $54 billion or 2/3 of that was offshore.\nOperator: From RBC Capital Markets, we'll hear from Mike Abramsky.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Tim, just following up on your last question, maybe I'll just ask this just absolutely directly. Is buying back shares with your cash, which seems to be sort of the thing that everybody wants you to do, at least certain investors want you to do it, is that perhaps kind of a philosophical white flag that you're not able to create value through product innovation?\nTimothy D. Cook: Mike, I think anyone looking at us and the track record that we've got would not come to any conclusion that we're waving a white flag on innovation. We've had a series of unbelievable products that we believe the best products in the world and our customers tell us that, which is more importantly than us saying it, and we've got a pipeline that's unbelievable.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Sorry, Tim. I didn't mean to convey that you were doing that. I meant to say that would that be holding you back philosophically from buying back shares?\nTimothy D. Cook: No, I view those to be totally separate and distinct things. So no, I don't believe it sends that -- it certainly doesn't send that signal from my point of view. The cash is always a topic, and we'll always conclude to do what we think is in Apple's best interest. And I think we've done that so far, and if you look at where we've spent it, I think it's -- I think you would agree.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay. And then the original goal for the iPhone, at the time it was obviously classed as audacious, with 1% of the market in the first fiscal year after launch. And you achieved 5x that, Tim. In the recent presentation when you highlighted that, there's 95% of the market to go. I'm wondering if in your minds you have established a similarly audacious goal for the next couple of years for market penetration.\nTimothy D. Cook: Not one that I published, but we want the iPhone to be in as many customers' hands as possible because we think it's the greatest phone by far. And that's why we live to do that. And so yes, we aspire to much larger volumes than where we are. And we think the smartphone market will eventually absorb the handset market. As I made a point in that presentation, the handset market is this huge market. It's 1.5 billion handsets. And the smartphone market, depending upon which service you believe, is a bit over 400 million or so. And so there's a huge growth in the smartphone market, and then we think that we can also grow within the sector at all. But the big win is to eat into the 1.5 billion and not just for us but I think for others as well, and we are very focused on doing that. You can tell that with the moves that we've made recently.\nOperator: We'll go to Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montr\u00e9al.\nKeith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: I have 2. Peter, first for you. Is the extra week for the quarter truly linear on both the revenues and the expenses? And included, the reason I'm asking is just trying to set up, if you will, for the March quarter, the potential impact of that extra week on the March quarter.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure, Keith. The 14th week will conclude on New Year's Eve day, which has traditionally been a good sell-through week for us but not typically as strong as the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas day. We'll provide further details on our January call about what we actually saw. That's some indication in terms of what we would see for sell-through. For our expenses, we certainly will have variable expenses and payroll expenses for that 14th week. But some of our fixed cost such as leases and rents and such are fixed, so there will be a benefit there as well.\nKeith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And my follow-up is on Japan. In terms of the year-over-year and sequential changes, there was a bigger disparity on units versus revenues, CPU units versus total revenues in Japan. I was just wondering if you could speak to that if you could.\nTimothy D. Cook: I'm sorry?\nKeith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: In terms of the revenue performance in Japan, it looked to be a bigger disparity between the units and the revenues than was true in the other regions. I was just wondering why the bigger disparity in Japan. Was it FX, or was it other reasons?\nTimothy D. Cook: A huge percentage of Japan's total revenue in the year-ago quarter was from the iPhone 4 launch. It was iPhone 4's first quarter as you know. And so when you do a year-over-year compare, that adversely affects the revenue compare. The Mac, however, had an incredible quarter growing at 48% in a market that is barely growing at all. And so we gained significant share on the Mac side of the business. The iPhone was a negative year-over-year compare, but we have gotten off to an unbelievable start in Japan. It was one of the first 7 countries, and it's very clear that Japan is yet another example of the delay that we were speaking about earlier.\nKeith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. So the sequential was then there was perhaps a larger delay in Japan for the iPhone 4S than other regions. Is that the way to think about it?\nTimothy D. Cook: Think about it that iPhone is a bigger portion of the revenue [indiscernible].\nOperator: And that will come from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Tim, I wanted to ask about the medium to longer term iPad opportunity as you see it from an ASP standpoint or segmentation standpoint. And by that, I mean, do you see more opportunity to move that product downmarket to drive elasticity, or upmarket to take on more of the -- or greater percentage on the PC market?\nTimothy D. Cook: I don't want to get into what we might do, which that answer might do. But let me just go back to -- we see the tablet market as a huge market, and we could not be happier with our position in it. And we've got some fantastic things in the pipeline. And after selling 40 million in the first 18 months, which is more than our wildest dreams were and selling 3 out of every 4, I think we've got a fairly good handle on what to do next.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. Perhaps I can ask an initial feedback or expectations around the lower price points of the iPhone business into emerging markets. Can you comment at all or give some color on carrier receptivity of that pricing change and any acceleration in carrier engagements on the back of that?\nTimothy D. Cook: Let me -- maybe I can answer that in 2 ways. If you look at the channel inventory on iPhone that was there at the end of Q4, and so this is at the September 24 cutoff point for our quarter, that was the 5.75 million that Peter mentioned in his opening comments. Over half of that has already sold through. And so one portion of the things driving that is the elasticity question that you're getting at there. We also did in a very few countries last quarter, we dropped the 3GS price a bit early particularly in some of the prepaid markets to see what would occur on those markets, and we were extremely pleased with the results. It gave us even more conviction to follow through with the plan change that we made earlier in October.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Chris.

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're thrilled to report the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple history. We also set a new all-time quarterly record for iPhone and iPad sales and a new June quarter record for Mac sales and we're extremely pleased with the momentum of our business. Revenue for the quarter was $28.6 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 82%. This record quarterly revenue topped the previous record established in the most recent December quarter by $1.8 billion and was almost $13 billion over the year ago quarter's result. The tremendous year-over-year increase was fueled primarily by dramatic growth in iPhone and iPad sales in addition to strong growth in Mac sales. Operating margin was a record high of $9.4 billion, representing 32.8% of revenue. Net income was $7.3 billion, topping the previous quarterly record set in the December quarter by $1.3 billion. Net income grew even faster than revenue, increasing 125% year-over-year and translated to earnings per share of $7.79. Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established the new June quarter record with sales of 3.95 million Macs representing a 14% increase over the year ago quarter's result. This growth is more than 4x IDCs most recently published forecast of 3% growth for the PC market overall. Mac sales were particularly strong in our Asia-Pacific segment, where we experienced a 57% year-over-year increase in total Macs sold. We generated healthy Mac growth in both desktop and portable categories. In May, we updated the iMac with the next-generation quad core processors, powerful new graphics, high speed portable I/O technology and a new space time, HD camera. The growth in Mac portable sales was driven by strong sales of MacBook Pro, as well as MacBook Air. We began to enter the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory. We are very excited to be launching Mac OS X Lion tomorrow. The Lion includes more than 250 new features such as a multi-touch gestures, system wide support for full screen apps, Mission Control, which is an innovative view of everything running on your Mac and much more. Moving to our music products. We sold 7.5 million iPods compared to 9.4 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continues to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD. And iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes store generated strong results with revenue of almost $1.4 billion. iTunes revenue was up 36% year-over-year, thanks primarily to continued strong sales of music, video and apps. With more than 225 million accounts, iTunes is the #1 music retailer in the world and customers have downloaded more than 15 billion songs today. I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We were thrilled to sell a record 20.3 million iPhones compared to 8.4 million in the previous June quarter. This represents 142% year-over-year growth, which is more than double IDC's latest published estimate of 67% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the June quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales were $13.3 billion during the quarter compared to $5.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 150%. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year iPhone sales growth in all of our operating segments. iPhone sales momentum in the Asia-Pacific region was particularly robust with sales almost quadrupling year-over-year. We continue to increase our overall iPhone manufacturing capacity in the quarter. We were pleased to launch a number of new carrier relationships. And by the end of the quarter, iPhone was available through 228 carriers in 105 countries, compared to 186 carriers in 90 countries as of the end of the March quarter. We ended the quarter with about 5.9 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 700,000 to support strong iPhone demand, carrier addition and expanded distribution. We remained within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. iPhone continues to be adopted as the standard across the enterprise with 91% of the Fortune 500 deployed or testing the device, up from 88% last quarter. We're also seeing great growth in scale worldwide. Today, 57% of Global 500 companies are testing or deploying iPhone, fueled by strong employee demand and opportunities for custom App development. Some examples of Global 500 companies supporting iPhones on their corporate networks, include AXA, Credit Agricole, Nestl\u00e9, Dow Chemical, GlaxoSmithKline, SUPERVALU and Comcast. Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its incredible momentum. We sold a record 9.2 million iPads during the June quarter compared to 3.3 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 183%. We were able to increase production sequentially by over 4.5 million and we sold every iPad we can make. We launched iPad 2 in an additional 36 countries. And combining the original iPad and iPad 2, we ended the quarter with distribution in a total of 64 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was over 6 billion, compared to 2.2 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 179%. We ended the quarter with about 1.05 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 200,000, which was well below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. Today, 86% of the Fortune 500 are deploying or testing iPad within their enterprises, up from 75% last quarter. We are also seeing strong adoption internationally with 47% of Global 500 companies testing or deploying iPad. In the 15 months since iPad has shipped, we've seen iPads used in the enterprise in ways we could have never imagined. Companies like Boston Scientific, Xerox and Salesforce.com are deploying thousands of iPads and revolutionize in how their sales teams engage their customers. iPad is being used inside the country's top hospitals like HCA and Cedars-Sinai and in retail at Nordstrom and at Este\u00e9 Lauder's Clinique counters. General Electric, SAP and Standard Charter have developed internal Apps for training, currency tracking and business process management to help make employees even more productive. And Alaska Airlines and American Airlines are using the iPad in cockpit to replace paper-based navigational and reference information pilots carry with him on every flight. We continue to be delighted by the diverse and sometimes, unexpected use cases we see around iPad. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached over 222 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the June quarter. Last month, we provided a preview of iOS 5, which includes over 200 new features such as notification center for viewing and managing notifications without interruption, iMessage for sending text messages, photos and videos between iOS devices and Newsstand, a new way to purchase an organized newspaper and magazine subscriptions. With the new PC-free feature, iOS 5 users will be able to activate and set up iOS devices right out of the box with no computer required. We are looking forward to launching iOS 5 this fall. In June, we also provided a preview of iCloud, our set of free new services that work seamlessly with applications on the customer's iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac or PC to automatically and wirelessly store content in the cloud, as well as push it to all the users' devices. We think customers will love using iCloud and we look forward to its release in the fall. The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 425,000 apps available in over 15 billion downloads to date. And as we mentioned last month, we're extremely pleased to have reached over 2.5 billion in cumulative payments to iOS developer, far ahead of any of our competitors. I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which generated record June quarter results. Revenue grew to $3.5 billion from $2.6 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 36%. This growth was driven primarily by higher volumes of iPad, iPhones and Macs. The store sold 768,000 Macs compared to 677,000 Macs in the year ago quarter, an increase of 13%. And about half of the Macs sold in our stores during the June quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened 4 new stores in the quarter, including 2 in France, 1 in the U.K. and 1 in Germany, ending with a total of 327. With an average of 325 stores open, average revenue per store was $10.8 million compared to $9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 20%. Retail segment margin was $828 million compared to $593 million in the year ago quarter. Store traffic continues to be very strong. We hosted 73.7 million visitors in the June quarter compared to 60.5 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 22%.  Our recently launched, personal setup program is off to a great start. Customers love this new feature the retail store experience that they're up and running with their new products before they leave. During the June quarter, we set up over 2 million Macs, iPhone, iPads and iPods collectively. We plan to open 30 new stores in the September quarter, including our first store in Hong Kong. That will bring us to a total of 40 store openings in fiscal 2011, including 28 new stores outside United States. Total company gross margin was 41.7%, which was 370 basis points higher than our guidance. This difference was a result of 3 approximately equal factors: a stronger mix of iPhone; lower commodity and other costs, which included some one-time items; and leverage on the higher revenue. Operating expenses were $2.54 billion and included $232 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was $172 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 23.5%. Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $76.2 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $65.8 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $10.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $11.1 billion, an increase of 131% year-over-year. I'd now like to talk about the accounting implications of some of the new aspects of our products and services. First, when we deliver Mac OS X Lion to customers, we are now including the right to receive future unspecified minor software upgrades and features when and if they become available for both the Mac operating system and our suite of Mac OS allied [ph] applications. We will continue to charge for standalone sales of our periodic major OS upgrades, such as Lion, as well as major upgrades of iLife. Revenue from these standalone sales will now be fully deferred at the time of sale and recognized over a period of 3 years. In addition to this future software upgrade right, Mac customers will have access to iCloud services when they become available in the fall. We estimate that the combined value of the software upgrade right and iCloud services for Mac customers is $22. Therefore, as of June 6, we began deferring $22 of the revenue associated with each new Mac sold. And we will recognize these deferred amounts as revenue over a period of 4 years.  Purchasers of IOS devices will also have access to iCloud. So beginning on June 6, we begin to sign a portion of the revenue from each iOS device sold to represent the estimated value of the right to receive iCloud services when they become available. That deferred amount is in addition to the amount that we will already deferring for each iOS device sold to represent the right to receive future iOS software upgrades. As a result, beginning on June 6, we are deferring a total of $16 of revenue for each iPhone and iPad sold and a total of $11 for each iPod touch sold and recognizing those amounts over a period of 2 years. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking statements that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $25 billion compared to $20.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38%, reflecting approximately $55 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.725 billion, including about $245 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $50 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 24%. We are targeting EPS of about $5.50. In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record revenue and earnings and the tremendous customer response to our products. Through the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2011, we have generated $35 billion in year-over-year revenue growth translating to a 78% increase. At the same time, we have generated over $9.5 billion in year-over-year earnings growth, representing a 99% increase. We remain very excited about our new product pipeline and we look forward to releasing the Mac OS X Lion tomorrow and bring in the wonderful new features of iOS 5 and iCloud to customers this fall. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: The 12% revenue downtick, Peter, in September is much more conservative than your typical September guidance and what you end up reporting in September, which is usually a 20% plus increase for the last 4 years. Can you help us understand why you expect this next quarter to trend softer than seasonal and maybe how you handicap the impact from some of the new software services and products that you expect to launch in the quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Let me start with the units and I'll give you some thoughts on revenue. For the education-buying season, September has historically been more weighted to higher education and we would expect this to be the same this year. We have the best line-up of Macs ever and we'd expect to see a year-over-year increase in sales. We also expect a year-over-year increase in iPhone sales. And for iPad, we're continuing to expand our quarterly production capacity and point of sale and we'd expect a significant year-over-year increase in sales. For iPod, we would expect to see a sequential year-over-year decline. As we announced at WWDC, we have a lot going on in the fall with the introduction of iOS 5 and iCloud. We also have a future product transition that we're not going to talk about today and these things will impact our September quarter. We remain very confident in our business, our new product pipeline and our momentum.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Peter, as that relates to future product transitions, can you just remind us how you approach working those into your guidance, you tend to be conservative and wait and see what happens with those products?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, as I've said a moment ago, we're not going to talk about this in any detail today. We factored our thinking into our guidance. We are incredibly confident about our business, our new product pipeline and what we're doing.\nOperator: From Cross Research, we'll go to Shannon Cross.\nShannon Cross: Tim, could you talk a bit about iPad 2 sales and trends? It's still relatively early I suppose, but I'm curious as to what you're seeing in terms of any potential cannibalization or shift of people away from portables, just any thoughts you have on the iPad 2?\nTimothy Cook: Yes. Sure, Shannon. In terms of cannibalization, we do believe that some customers chose to purchase an iPad instead of the new Mac during the quarter, but we also believe that even more customers chose to purchase an iPad over Windows PC. And as I've said before, there's a lot more of the Windows PC business to cannibalize than the Mac. Also, we believe that the Mac has many other attributes that would make it continue to do well in the market. We're very happy that we grew 14% versus the markets growth of 2.6%, which is about 5x as Peter said earlier. And so that's what we see with iPad. As Peter said earlier, we were still selling every unit we could make during the quarter and that was the situation as we ended the quarter. As we stepped into July over the initial weeks to give you a more current update, we had been able to increase the supply further. And some SKUs and some countries are at a supply-demand balance, but we're still working very hard on the balance of the world. The sales of iPad 2 have absolutely been a frenzy for people to give one and we feel very good about the progress that we've made about ramping up and the reception that it received in marketplace.\nShannon Cross: Great. And then if you could talk just a little bit about China. Clearly, your growth in Asia Pac was at almost 250% year-over-year, just any update on China?\nTimothy Cook: Yes. That's a good question. China was very key to our results. As a reminder, we define Greater China as Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Year-over-year, it was up over 6x and the revenue was approximately $3.8 billion during the quarter and that makes the year-to-date numbers through the 3 quarters that we've had thus far around $8.8 billion. And so this has been a substantial opportunity for Apple and I firmly believe that we're just scratching the surface right now. I think there is an incredible opportunity for Apple there.\nOperator: From Barclays Capital, Benjamin Reitzes.\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: I wanted to talk a little bit more about the outlook for gross margin. You said 38% from the 41.7%. Can you talk about what components and/or mix dynamics will impact that, Peter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. We expect the gross margin, Ben as you said, to be about 38% and down about 370 basis points sequentially. We expect about 2/3 of this decline to be driven by the different product mix and we expect the remainder to be due to the loss of leverage on the lower sequential revenue. The cost of the future product transition, a full quarter of the back-to-school promotion.\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: I guess the components aspect of that?\nTimothy Cook: Ben, it's Tim, both NAND and DRAM and also LCDs, batteries, optical drives and most of the components are generally in a very positive supply situation currently. And pricing is expected to fall at or above the historical trend. Hard drive supply is currently constrained. We project the price declines in this area will be less than the historical rates. We do expect therefore components to be favorable on a sequential comparison. However, this is largely being offset by one-time benefits that we receive that are embedded in the 41.7% gross margin that Peter talked about earlier in the June quarter. And therefore, not a part of the bridge that Peter just talked about.\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Hopefully, I didn't miss this, but can you give us a little more color on that one-time benefit in gross margins, how significant was it? And any color on what drove that?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Bill, it's Peter. We saw some benefits in our warranty and phone support area and some settlements that we had. They weren't huge in the June quarter, but we did see some benefits there. And as Tim said, we see that generally offsetting, the reversal of that generally offsetting the component benefits that he just talked about in the September quarter.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay. Great. And then a quick follow up. There's been a lot of news around patent disputes as of late, some seems to have gone in Apple's favor, while others haven't. Can you help us understand, Tim, how to put these events in context? How we should think about your IP strategy overall and perhaps how all this is potentially impacting the competitive landscape in smartphones and tablets?\nTimothy Cook: We have a very simple view here, and that view is, we love competition. We think it's great for us and for everyone. But we want people to invent their own stuff and we're going to make sure that we defend our portfolio perfectly.\nOperator: Richard Gardner with Citigroup.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc: Surprised nobody has asked it, but I was just hoping that you could provide a little more color on what drove the iPhone's strength in the quarter, was it new carriers or existing, new countries or existing? I know you've specifically referred to China as being a driver, but just a little more color on what you saw with iPhone in the quarter, please?\nTimothy Cook: Yes. Richard, it's Tim. It's a great question. We did add 42 new carriers and 15 new countries during the quarter, and so we continued our expansion efforts to get up beyond the 2.25 carrier number and above 100 countries. However, those occurred throughout the quarter and the real sequential improvement, frankly, was due to emerging and developed markets. China was a big part of it, Latin America driven by Brazil and Mexico was a big part of it, and the Middle East was a big part of it, which I think is great for Apple because these are markets that Apple historically has not been as strong and we're really beginning to see the fruits of our labor in these markets.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc: And then, Tim, would you be willing to give us, as a follow-up, any sort of milestones that you're hoping to hit for the next quarter or 2 in terms of new carriers and countries for iPhone?\nTimothy Cook: No, but I think you can see that it's something that is of great focus to us. We want to do business with great partners and there are still great partners out there to do business with, and so we're obviously off working new relationships.\nOperator: Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: The iPhone clearly is gaining share, but comments from Google last week just said Android activations were up 56% quarter-over-quarter and by our math, it looks like iOS activations were up around 20%. Tim, you mentioned that China is on fire right now up 600%. Obviously, you're doing relatively well in emerging markets but any thoughts in terms of how do you think, I guess, about that Android activation number relative to your business?\nTimothy Cook: I think the Android activation number is a difficult one to get our hands around, because unlike our numbers, which you can kind of go to our data sheet and you can add the iPods and the iPads and make a reasonable approximation of the iPod touch which spans over half of our iPod sales. You can quickly see that in the June quarter that we sold over 33 million iOS devices and across time, as Peter mentioned in his opening comments, we are now over 222 million cumulative iOS devices. And so we think this is incredible. And so our numbers are very straight forward, they're transparent and they're reported quarterly. In terms of iPhone, iPhone is up 142% year-over-year. This is more than 2x the rate of growth of the smartphone market. We think that's incredible. Also, as Peter said earlier, we sold every iPad 2 in the quarter that we could make and so there certainly was not a shortage of demand. We're also gaining traction in enterprise. From the numbers that Peter spoke of, obviously, now our attention is not turning to getting corporations to test and pilots, but it's more -- was really converted to more of a penetration focus. Our App Store is the largest by far and if you look at iPad specific apps, we are over 100,000. And I think you would be hard-pressed to find a little bit of a few 100 on the other platform. It also doesn't appear that the other tablets are getting any traction to speak of, and we've paid over $2.5 billion to developers and so there's a great business proposition for developers and you can tell the customers about it because we have well over 15 billion apps that have been downloaded. And so we're very, very confident of the product. We're confident with the App Store. We're confident with our proposition for developers. The customer stat in every survey I had seen ranks the iPhone #1. And so we're very confident in the customer reception. We're also very confident in our roadmap and so we feel very, very good. You may have seen the data that just came out, I believe, it was yesterday, from ChangeWave that reaffirmed once again that iPhone is the clear leader in customer satisfaction and also was the #1 preference to those people planning to buy smartphone in the next 90 days. And so it seems like there's a lot of great things and we feel absolutely fantastic about it.\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: Okay. Just a follow-up question, any update on Apple TV and maybe some thoughts on your strategy in the connected TV markets?\nTimothy Cook: Apple TV continues to do well, but I don't want to mislead. We still call it a hobby here and we do that because we don't want anyone to conclude that it's another leg of the stool because it's not in the same market that iPhone is in, or that the iPad is in, or that the Mac is in, or that the iPod is in. And so we love the product It's clear that customers love the product. We really guided right when we went to the new Apple TV just last fall. But right now, it's still a hobby status that we're continuing to invest in it because we think that there is something there.\nOperator: From JPMorgan, we'll go to Mark Moskowitz.\nMark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I just want to touch base here, Tim, on just the scintillating sales velocity. Is Apple at a point now where you kind of diversify your contract manufacturing base, as well as even your non-Apple retail channel? And what are the opportunity and risk there?\nTimothy Cook: In terms of the non-Apple retail channel, if you take the iPhone as an example, which as you know makes up a large percentage of our business, we have about 115,000 points of sale. And so I feel that we're incredibly diversified. We're selling through carriers, through retail. We're selling through our own stores, through our online store. We're selling through companies that have direct sales forces. We are selling to enterprise, including an overlay sales force of our own. So I think the channel is extremely well-diversified. There are still countries, where we're still building the channel and so I don't want to give you a view that I think the journey is completed, but in the mature markets I feel that the channels are in good shape. And in the markets, where we're putting more and more energy, obviously, there is still channel development to do there, but I think it's well understood and under control. So as I don't, really, that's not something that I worry about at all, actually. In terms of suppliers, I don't want to get into this in any detail, because I think this is one of those things for us that is the part of the magic and a part of the things that we feel that we have some secret sauce in and I prefer not to share it. But your general point about, are we too centralized in one place, or are we too dependent on a place. You can -- the people hear that are involved in the supply chain, we got some outstanding ones, always ask that question and I think we always at the end of the day make the right decision for Apple.\nMark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Understood. Appreciate that. Maybe just a follow-up for you Tim or Peter. You've talked in the past about the iPhone and the iPad 2 just because of the leading edge technology that sometimes the manufacturing yield are a little lighter than what we all think. Where are you guys now in terms of manufacturing yields, have you walked further up the curve in terms of better utilization?\nTimothy Cook: I don't want to give you a specific yield numbers, but as I've said earlier, the supply of iPad improved dramatically in the quarter, that allowed us to do the over 9.2 million, that's up from the 4.7 from the prior quarters that we added almost 100%. I also said that we had further incurred the supply in the initial weeks of July. And that's allowed us to get into a supply-demand balance on some SKUs and some countries. So I feel very, very good about our progress in that area.\nOperator: Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Tim, the trajectory of iPhone growth has been nothing less of astounding because, now you're 142%. You were 113%, last quarter, 86%. So I'm just trying to understand what your thinking is on the keys to sustain that growth. Particularly, do you see the current pricing, for example, and tariffs perhaps approaching a level, maybe North America saw saturation. Do you need to address that? Different form back factors, expanded distribution or just stay on the same business model, especially these lower cost Android competitors potentially coming from Asia? Can you talk to that?\nTimothy Cook: Well, I think on the tariff side, Apple doesn't set the tariffs. So it is set by the carrier. And so I think that's a better question for them, but at a very macro level, I think what you would find if you went out and talked to several around the world is that virtually every one of them are desirous of having more and more customer have a smartphone and begin to use data on their networks because this is the way for them to expand their ARPUs. And I firmly believe there is no better device than the iPhone for someone to move from any phone up to a smartphone. So ease of use is just unparalleled, and the ecosystem is unparallel. And so I think there is a good alignment in that area. I mentioned a few moments ago that the key driver in our sequential results on the iPhone are sequential improvement in unit, we're emerging and developing market. So you can see that we're putting more and more energy in these markets that have been a bit more difficult to do well in versus some of the markets that are in the established countries and subsidized countries or they're primarily subsidizing. So I think we have a very good focus here. And I think we can compete with anyone.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: So those markets would have prepay, for example, lower purchasing power, indirect distribution. Are those things you are going to need to address through pricing and other means?\nTimothy Cook: Those markets that I mentioned that we were doing well in, there are some percentage of postpaid in some of those markets, but if you looked at the market in the aggregate, most of those markets are predominantly prepaid. In some cases, we've convinced someone to start a postpaid plan because in the long term, I think that's better for the customer, the carrier and us. But in general, we are also playing in the prepaid market. We're not avoiding that market. We don't want to avoid that market. We know that we need to play there in order to have the kind of volumes that we'd like to have. And in terms of your question on expanding channels and developing channels, we're obviously that is -- is on our list and with the 115,000 down now, we have some experience there. We know we've got a lot more to do, but we've got some experience under our belt now to play with.\nOperator: From Bank of Montreal, we'll hear from Keith Bachman.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Tim, this is for you. Mac growth was about 5% sequential. In the past 2 years, the sequential growth has looked more like 17% to 18% and notebook sequential growth was even below that. So I wanted to go back to what do you think in this quarter was cannibalization versus perhaps some hold-backs in anticipation of Lion? And how does that show up you think in terms of catch-up in the September quarter?\nTimothy Cook: Yes. I really look more at year-over-year than I do sequential on the Mac. But I am going to get at your -- the answer to your question anyway. I think, first of all, I am proud of the numbers that we achieved. To grow at 14%, when the market is growing at 2.6%, doing 5x the rate of growth is certainly something to be proud of. However, in terms of why isn't the number higher than 14%, obviously, we always focus on that. No matter if the number was 42%, we would focus on that. I think there are 3 things that are the primary factor. And I don't want to try to quantify these for you, but I do want to list them and how we look at it. The first is, as I've said before, I think there were some cannibalization of new Mac by iPad. We shipped a record 9.2 billion iPads during the quarter, which is over 2x the number of Macs that we shipped. And it's clear that some customers chose to purchase an iPad instead of a new Mac. But the thing that really excites us is that more customers chose to buy an iPad than a Windows PC. The second one is, I think, some customers have delayed purchase until Lion becomes available. And as Peter commented on earlier, we are launching Lion tomorrow. And we're looking forward to getting Lion out. It's a fantastic product. The guys have worked very, very hard on it and it's really a revolutionary change. But the third thing that I wouldn't discount it, in the year ago quarter, we launched new MacBook Pro. In this particular quarter, we launched new iMac. Both products were well received, however, the MacBook Pro makes up over the majority of the units that we sell in the Mac area. And so obviously, if you change the MacBook Pro and it's well received, it's going to make the comp more difficult to compare to. And so those are the 3 things that I think are primarily why the number isn't more than it is. But I don't want to lose site that it is already is 5x the industry and this is the 21st consecutive quarter that we beat the market.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: My follow-up then is if I look at the sequential growth pattern in the September quarter, I would assume given the demand and as you said, you're catching up here in the month of July that iPads would increase sequentially, including probably some potential channel fill. But I just want to see if you could give us some feedback on what the growth trajectory look like after this great quarter here in iPads.\nTimothy Cook: Well, we don't predict unit sales. We aggregate things into a guidance and Peter went through that earlier. So I don't want to make a comment about iPad other than I think Peter said earlier, which I'm sure that you would have reached conclusion of anyways that we think iPad will grow significantly year-over-year. And we'll leave the rest of it to you to conclude and then we would be very happy to report in October how we did that.\nOperator: From Bank of America, we'll go to Scott Craig.\nScott Craig: Tim, could you maybe provide a bit more color around what exactly the issues are for the iPad ramping up into the sort of levels that you want to get to? And can you hazard a guess as to when you think you'll be at sort of equilibrium on a global basis from a production and supply standpoint?\nTimothy Cook: This is a good sort of problem per se is that the demand is fantastic. And so there's not something that I would point to on a supply side saying that this is creating a huge issue, it's the good problem. And as I said before, and I generally don't do that, but in this case, I am to talk about July. In the first weeks of July, we're now 3 -- a little over 3 weeks into the quarter. Supply has further improved since we ended our June quarter and that further improvement has led some SKUs in some countries to become in supply-demand balance. Now, I'm not going to project what will happen to the other country, but obviously, we're working very, very hard to get as many units to customers as we can. And we placed our latest thinking in the guidance obviously.\nScott Craig: And maybe just a quick follow-up, Tim. Is there anything you guys are doing differently as far as investing in the enterprise sales force, so to speak, or doing anything differently as far as going to market on the enterprise side that you can point us to? And then, I guess, we'll see the fruits of that labor as we sort of go forward here.\nTimothy Cook: We have a dual-prong strategy with enterprise on both the iPad and the iPhone. As we work with the carrier sales forces and they have very large ones because they're selling their services into enterprise and many of these enterprises want that one of our device is connected to it and so we train and provide quite a bit of help to the carrier forces. Plus we do some sales, directly our sales or act as an overlay sales force to a channel that sells to enterprise. And I would characterize this as we're still building it out and we do a bit better each quarter. We're very, very happy with the numbers that Peter talked about earlier about the level of interest and taking people to the pilot and initial deployment stages. And now our attention is moving to penetration within those accounts versus sort of getting on the standards lists. And I think you'd really look at it fairly to be this far into the enterprise with a product that's only been shipping for 15 months in the case of iPad is absolutely incredible, because the enterprise is typically much more conservative and takes a long time to evaluate products. In this case, people are moving at a speed I haven't seen. Also in a group that's not thought of as enterprise like K-12, our K-12 generally takes a very long time for new product categories, but last quarter, we sold more iPads in K-12 than we did not. And to do that after just 5 quarters is absolutely shocking. We would've never predicted that. And so we feel very, very good about the different area that iPad is being sold into. It's clear it has a universal appeal in many different markets from consumer to business to government and on and on.\nOperator: From Wedge Partners, we'll go to Brian Blair.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: Can you just talk a little bit about your views on iCloud and just how you feel as a service it's going to drive more volumes to Mac and maybe just talk about what are your expectations on the halo effect across other iOS devices?\nPeter Oppenheimer: This is Peter. We cannot wait to get iCloud and iOS 5 into the hands of customers in the fall. We really think that we have done it right with iCloud. We're going to deliver customers just a seamless integrated experience that we think that they are going to love. We're going to make it very easy and it didn't go unnoticed back to us yesterday that in the ChangeWave results, that was one of the reasons cited why the iOS devices are #1 in terms of intent to buy.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: And maybe just briefly, if you can comment on, just do you feel like you have much of a lead over your competitors and the ability to instantly mirror content across different devices? It feels like it's a real competitive edge for you, but I'd love to hear your thought if you wouldn't mind sharing any.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, we're certainly very, very good with the Internet, with telecommunications in delivering content. I think we have proven it in Mac for a decade first beginning with iTunes and now with the App Store and our payments to developers exceeding $2.5 billion. So we probably have some things to learn as we go forward. But have a lot of skills and are very excited to get iCloud in the customers' hands.\nOperator: We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Tim, I wanted to revisit China and also prepaid phones. China Mobile recently said it has 5.6 million phones on its net -- iPhones on its network as of the end of May, and was adding them at an incredible rate. Obviously, China Mobile doesn't sell the phone. So that would certainly point to a lot of a prepaid phones or unlocked phones on their network. I believe also your direct distribution in China for the iPhone, both online and retail stores is in a prepaid fashion. So I was wondering if you could tell us how significant prepaid is in China and other emerging markets, how much progress you've made there and what lessons you've learned given that you yourselves are also selling them prepaid? And I have a follow-up, please.\nTimothy Cook: Prepaid or unlocked phones are, said more an English, phones sold without a contract are very key in China and very key in a number of the emerging markets, where the credit systems are not as well established as they are in the U.S., Japan and Western Europe and Australia, et cetera. And so you can look at our volume, Toni, that the iPhone volume for the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year was up 5x year-over-year. And iPhone is the key contributor to Greater China having a cumulative revenue of around $8.8 billion for the first 3 quarters. And so I am not saying at all that we have figured out precisely how to play perfectly in the environment we have and I think we have more to do and more to learn. But I feel very, very good about our progress. I think if any of us would have been told a year ago that we would do $3.8 billion in Greater China in a quarter, I don't think very many of us would've believed it. And I don't think any of you would've believed that. And so we feel very, very good about it and we're taking those learnings and applying those to other markets as well.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: If I could follow up, your market share data is pretty irrefutable, and it's pretty consistent in terms of your being a share gainer. There are parts of the world in developed countries like U.K., Germany, France and Japan, where some of the recent market data suggests that you've actually lost share in iPhones on a year-over-year basis in Q2. I was wondering if you could tell us whether gaining share in the smartphone category for iPhone is strategically important to Apple longer term, and how we get our minds around sustained share gains given that most of the market data says smartphones above $300 are going to grow a lot slower than the overall smartphone market. So how do we: a, are share gains important to Apple in this marketplace; and how do we reconcile where you participate in its market growth rate relative to the overall market?\nTimothy Cook: Share gain is important anywhere where we are going, the opposite way then we're not happy. And you can bet that we're working hard to change that. In terms of playing in different price points, we do offer the 3GS, as an example today, which in the U.S. is $49 with a contract. And if you step that out into prepaid market, it really depends upon the VAT and duty and channel kind of uplifts as to what it is. So it varies greatly market-to-market. But it's clearly, in a distinctly different price than the iPhone 4 is. Our philosophy is the same as it's always been, Toni. We will only make products that we're proud of, that are the best in the world, and if we can do that and the price is lower then we're great with that. An example of that, that happened some time ago is the iPod shuffle was created. It started at a different price point, but it's now at $49 and that's because it's a product we're very proud of. It's very innovative. A lot of people love that product. So that's always the question for us in the litmus test. We will only make products that we're very proud of, that we want to own, that are the best in the world and regardless of what the price band analysis. Also, as we've seen and as I'm reminded time and time again as I look at some of the China data is it's up to us to convince people to maybe spend a little more for a materially better experience of product. And we think that people will do that if the product is great and if it's messaged appropriately and we got a lot of experience in both of those areas.\nOperator: We'll hear from Brian Marshall with Gleacher & Company.\nBrian Marshall - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you've learned with respect to media consumption on the iPad thus far?\nTimothy Cook: We learned that people love using it, Brian, for a whole variety of things. And that's the beauty of the iPad is that if you talk to 10 people, they would likely give you 10 different reasons why they love it. And I think that's the reason it's doing so well among a very diverse group of consumers in a diverse group of people in the market and geographies.\nBrian Marshall - Gleacher & Company, Inc.: And then perhaps a quick follow-up. With respect to content accumulation in regards to video, can you talk a little bit why we don't have more movie titles on iTunes at this point, and if we are going to be rectifying that in the future?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Brian, it's Peter. We have a very, very broad library of movies and TV shows particularly here in the United States. We are adding more content internationally each quarter and look for some more content later this quarter across the various stores. We have some neat stuff coming.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Brian.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the highest March quarter revenue and earnings in Apple's history. We set a new all-time quarterly record for iPhone sales, and a new March quarter record for Mac sales, and we're thrilled with the momentum for iPad.   Revenue for the quarter was $24.7 billion, which was $11.2 billion over the prior March quarter's result and represents the largest year-over-year quarterly revenue growth we've ever generated. This tremendous increase of 83% was fueled primarily by record iPhone sales, very robust demand for iPad and strong growth in Mac sales. Operating margin was an all-time high of almost $7.9 billion, representing 31.9% of revenue. Net income was almost $6 billion. This represented 95% growth over the year gross quarter's earnings and translated to earnings per share of $6.40.   Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new March quarter record with sales of 3.76 million Macs, representing 28% growth over the year ago quarter. We're extremely pleased with this very strong growth, particularly given IDC's most recently published estimate of a 3% contraction for the PC market overall. This result makes the March quarter the 20th consecutive quarter that we outperformed the PC market. We experienced strong Mac sales growth in each of our operating segments, most notably in the Asia-Pacific segment, where Mac sales increased 76% year-over-year. The growth in Mac sales was fueled primarily by the continued great popularity of MacBook Air, which was updated in the December quarter, as well as very strong sales of MacBook Pro. We updated the entire MacBook Pro family during the March quarter with the next-generation processors and graphics, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O technology and a new FaceTime HD camera.   The new MacBook Pro lineup offers twice the speed of the previous generation and customer response has been excellent. We began at the end of the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory. During the quarter, we released the developer preview of Mac OS X Lion, which takes some of the best ideas from the iPad and brings them back to the Mac. Lion features Mission Control an innovative new view of everything running on the Mac. Launchpad, a new home for all your Mac Apps, full screen apps that use the entire Mac display and new multi-touch gestures. Lion is scheduled to ship to customers this summer and we look forward to showing more of its great features at our Developers Conference in June.   Moving to our music products. We sold 9 million iPods compared to 10.9 million in the year ago quarter. Though lower year-over-year, total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations with iPod touch continuing to count for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continue to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.   We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes Store turned in its best quarter ever with revenue of almost $1.4 billion, thanks to record revenue from music, video, iOS apps and books. We were very pleased to begin offering a full catalog of 17,000 ebooks from Random House on the iBookstore during the March quarter. The iBookstore now includes ebooks for more than 2,500 publishers in over 20 categories, and customers have downloaded over 100 million books.   I'd now like to turn to the iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold a record 18.6 million iPhones compared to 8.8 million in the previous March quarter. This represents 113% year-over-year growth which is significantly ahead of IDC's latest published estimate of 74% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the March quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $12.3 billion during the quarter compared to $5.45 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 126%. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year iPhone sales growth in all of our operating segments with sales in both the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions more than doubling year-over-year.   We were able to make a significant increase in our capacity, once again, allowing us to expand distribution and get much-needed supply to our channel partners. We were very pleased to begin selling iPhones on the Verizon network in the U.S. in the March quarter, and we were also happy to add SK Telecom in Korea, as well as Saudi Telecom in Saudi Arabia. Including some carrier consolidation, we ended the quarter with iPhone distribution through 186 carriers in 90 countries.   We ended the quarter with about 5.2 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.7 million to support new carrier launches and existing channel partners. This placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. iPhone is continuing to see strong growth within the Enterprise segment. Today, 88% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPhone.   With strong employee demand and custom app development fueling adoption, we are seeing great scale of iPhone deployments in businesses worldwide. In fact, hundreds of private and public companies worldwide are supporting thousands of iPhones on their corporate networks. Some examples include Cisco, Prudential, Boston Scientific, General Motors, American Airlines, Deloitte, Yum! Brands and Xerox.   Turning to iPad, we continue to be thrilled with its momentum. We sold 4.7 million iPads during the March quarter, launching iPad 2 in U.S. on March 11 and in 25 additional countries on March 25. Customer enthusiasm has been tremendous for iPad 2 and we're working hard to get it into the hands of customers as quickly as possible.   Including both the original iPad and iPad 2, we had distribution in 59 countries by the end of the March quarter. Given the very strong customer demand and despite the increased geographic distribution, iPod (sic) [iPad] channel inventory declined by 400,000 from the beginning of the quarter, implying sell-through of about 5.1 million. This resulted in ending channel inventory of below 850,000, which was below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks. We sold every iPad 2 that we could make during the quarter and would have liked to end the quarter with more channel inventory. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $2.8 billion.   Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment remains strong and CIOs continue to embrace iPad in an unprecedented rate. In just over a year since its debut, 75% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPad within their enterprises. Some recent examples of enterprises that are deploying iPad include FORTUNE 500 companies such as Xerox, AutoNation, Yum! Brands, ADP, Boston Scientific, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Disney, Stryker, Prudential Financial, Rite Aid and USAA.   Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached just under 189 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the March quarter. In March, we introduced iOS 4.3 with new features including faster Safari mobile browsing performance with the Java Nitro script engine, iTunes Home Sharing, enhancements to AirPlay and the Personal Hotspot feature for sharing an iPhone 4 cellular data connection over Wi-Fi.   The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 350,000 apps available and well over 10 billion downloads to date. In February, we announced a new subscription service available to all publishers of content-based apps, including magazines, newspapers, video and music. Publishers set the price and length of subscription and customers select the subscription and length they want with 1 click. And it was also a great pleasure to announce in March that we have made more than $2 billion in payments to developers since opening the App Store.   I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. We are approaching the Retail Stores 10th anniversary on May 19, and we're on the verge of achieving a major milestone. In the next few days, we will be thrilled to welcome our 1 billionth visitor. Store traffic continues to be amazingly strong. And in the March quarter, we hosted a record 71.1 million visitors in our stores compared to 47 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 51%.   Retail revenue was $3.19 billion compared to $1.68 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 90%. Capitalizing on the February MacBook Pro update, the stores delivered another record Mac quarter, selling 797,000 Macs compared to 606,000 Macs in the year ago quarter, an increase of 32%, and about half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before.   To further enrich our Apple retail customer experience, we recently launched a program called Personal Setup. When customers buy a Mac, iPad, iPhone or iPod touch, our teams help the customer set up the product in the store so that they are up and running before they leave. Personal Setup includes the customer's e-mail, contacts, calendar, applications and more. In the March quarter, our stores set up over 1 million products. We operated 323 stores during the quarter. Average revenue per store was $9.9 million compared to $5.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 67%. International retail store sales remain strong with our average international store volume exceeding our very productive average U.S. store volume.   Retail segment margin more than doubled year-over-year to $807 million compared to $373 million in the year ago quarter. We anticipate opening 40 new stores in fiscal 2011, nearly 3 quarters of which will be outside the United States, including our fifth store in China.   Total company gross margin was 41.4%, which was 290 basis points higher than our guidance. More than half of this difference came from better product mix than planned, particularly higher iPhone sales. The remainder was largely a result of leverage on the higher revenue and lower-than-expected commodity, service and other costs.   Operating expenses were $2.34 billion and included $236 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $26 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 24.2%, below our guidance of 25.5% due to changes in our full year forecast of foreign earnings, R&D tax credit and state taxes.   Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $65.8 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $59.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $6.2 billion, an increase of 167% year-over-year. The increase in cash is net of approximately $900 million to combine prepayments and capital expenditures related to the strategic supply agreements that we referred to in our last quarterly call.   As we move into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $23 billion compared to $15.7 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38%, reflecting approximately $55 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.5 billion, including about $255 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $70 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25%. We are targeting EPS of about $5.03.   In closing, we're thrilled with the results and accomplishments of our record March quarter. We're extremely pleased with customers' response to iPad 2 and are working hard to get it into the hands of customers as fast as we can. We remain very confident in our strategy and are very excited about our new product pipeline.   And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks. Can you comment, Peter, on whether or not you're seeing any supply chain disruptions from the recent earthquake in Japan. And if so, how should we think about that in terms of that being factored in your guidance?\nTimothy Cook: Bill, this is Tim. Let me sort of step back and talk about Japan in general and sort of try to get all of your questions in advance. First of all, this is an incredible tragedy and our hearts go out to everyone involved. Apple, as a company, has a very long history and has many strong ties to people in Japan, and we're very, very saddened by the situation, and we've undertaken various actions to assist in the relief effort. The economic impact that we'll address today pales in comparison to the human impact. Regarding our business in Japan, we had some revenue impact in Q2 but it was not material to Apple's consolidated results. We believe revenues will be approximately $200 million less in Q3, and this has been factored into the guidance that Peter provided you earlier in his comments. Regarding our global supply chain, as a result of outstanding teamwork and unprecedented resilience of our partners, we did not have any supply or cost impact in our fiscal Q2 as a result of the tragedy, and we currently do not anticipate any material supply or cost impact in our fiscal Q3. To provide a bit more color on this, we sourced hundreds, literally hundreds of items from Japan, and they range from components such as LCDs, optical drives, NAND Flash and DRAM to base materials such as resins, coatings and foil that are part of the production process at several layers back in the supply chain. The earthquake and subsequent tsunami and the associated nuclear crisis caused disruption for many of these suppliers, and many unaffected suppliers have been impacted by power interruptions. But since the disaster, Apple employees have literally been working around the clock with our supplier partners in Japan, and have been able to implement a number of contingency plans. Our preference from the beginning of this tragedy has been to remain with our long-term partners in Japan. And I have to say, they have displayed an incredible resilience that I personally never seen before in the aftermath of this disaster. So while we do not anticipate -- currently anticipate any material impact to our component supply or cost in our fiscal Q3, we do need to caution everyone that the situation remains unpredictable given recent aftershocks, the uncertainty about the nuclear plant and potential power interruptions. Further, there are some supply risks that are beyond the current quarter. And although we know of no issue today that we view as unsolvable, the situation is still uncertain and there's obviously no guarantees. For this reason, it's difficult to predict whether the issues created by the tragedy would impact revenues beyond Q3. However, I'll be happy to address Q4 on our next call in July.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay, great. That was very helpful. I guess digging into another area of supply, looking at your iPad 2 constraints since launch in March, can you give us some color on where the constraints lie and how you're doing in terms of getting supply back in line with demand?\nTimothy Cook: Well, the demand on iPad 2 has been staggering. And we're still amazed that we are still heavily backlogged not only at the end of the quarter but also up to date. However, I can tell you that I'm extremely pleased with the progress of the manufacturing ramp, and we were so confident that we rolled out to 25 additional countries at the end of last month. And we are shipping to an additional 13 countries next week, and we're planning to add even more countries through the quarter. And so I'm very confident that we can produce a very large number of iPads for the quarter.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: From Citigroup, we'll go to Richard Gardner.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc: Okay, great. Thanks. I was just hoping to get a little bit more color on what drove the iPhone's strength in the quarter? If you could, by region or carrier, you mentioned that you added SK Telecom, and I'm not sure if shipments there were material during the quarter. And then, Peter, the follow-up to that I guess is, how do we think about iPhone seasonality going into the June quarter giving all of the moving parts? We have a full quarter of Verizon. In the June quarter, you've got some potential carrier expansion benefit and yet, you have a product refresh hopefully coming midyear, so I was hoping you could help us think about that a little bit for the June quarter. Thanks.\nTimothy Cook: Rich, it's Tim. In terms of iPhone, we did actually very well everywhere. I'd call out 2 places that -- where it was just off the charts. The U.S. grew 155% year-over-year, obviously, adding Verizon and beginning to offer iPhone to their enormous customer base was key in that. However, as you heard from AT&T's announcement this morning, AT&T did extremely well during the quarter. So the U.S. as a geography grew at 155% and that's about 3x IDC's forecast of growth for the smartphone market, which was about 48%. Also, we continued to be on a tear in China. Greater China saw iPhone sales being up over 3x, about 200 -- almost 250%. And this catapulted revenue for the first half or first fiscal half in Greater China to just under $5 billion, which is up almost 4x year-over-year. And so we're extremely happy with how we're doing in China.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Rich, and to hit the second part of your question. As I commented in my prepared remarks, we were able to increase the iPhone channel inventory by just over 1.7 million units in the March quarter, and we ended within our target, 4 to 6 week range of inventory. In terms of the June quarter, I would expect to see a significant year-over-year increase in sales.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc: And any comment on the sequential, Peter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: No, I think I'll leave it at year-over-year. I would expect us to be up significantly.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc: Okay. Alright. Well, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: From Morgan Stanley, we'll go to Katy Huberty.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Yes, thank you. Just following on the iPhone discussion, what, if anything, did you learn about the price elasticity curve for the iPhone with the $49 3GS price point in the market this quarter?\nTimothy Cook: Katy, it was very popular. It did very, very well.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: And then also from the perspective of some positive feedback on LTE phones that are out from your competitors, how do you think about the maturity of those networks and Apple's sense of urgency to get products out for those faster networks? And what if any bottlenecks exist?\nTimothy Cook: I was asked this question or a similar question when we launched the iPhone with Verizon. And what I've said then, and I still see it as being the case today, and I think you can see this in the products that have been shipped, is that the first generation of LTE chipsets force a lot of design compromises with the handset, and some of those, we are just not willing to make. And so we are extremely happy with the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3GS. And hitting 18.6 million units was something much larger than we thought we could do this quarter, and we're happy to have gotten it out to 3 more large carriers.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Katy.\nOperator: Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Could you talk a bit about the international penetration of Macs? Just perhaps, I don't know, Tim, comparing your adoption curve in the U.S. to where we are internationally, and if there's any difference in terms of the type of computers that your customers are purchasing internationally?\nTimothy Cook: Yes, if you look at it, Shannon, the growth on the Mac has been enormous in Asia. The last quarter, we were up 76% in Asia-Pacific. And yes, this is many multiples of the growth that the -- that region is seeing for the market. I believe the IDC forecast is around 6%. And so we're seeing enormous growth in the Mac there. Japan also did quite well on the Mac for the quarter, and the U.S. had a surprisingly strong quarter in the Mac with being up around -- Americas is up 25%. The U.S. was up just slightly higher than that. Our market share is obviously less outside the U.S. in most places than it is in the U.S., and so I think that speaks very, very well to the opportunity that the Mac has. We've now had 20 quarters in a row where we've outgrown the PC market and the momentum is still there. And we seem to be the only guys that are really focused on building innovative products in that space.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. Has there been any difference between sort of portable versus desktop purchases internationally, or is it sort of trending in line with what you've seen in the U.S.?\nTimothy Cook: There are several of the international countries that are extremely portable focused. And you can see that we had enormous growth in our portables for the quarter. However, part of that is that we had a launch of the new MacBook Pro line. But honestly, I see popularity in both the iMac and the portable factor, and believe there is a great future for both of them.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon.\nOperator: From Bank of Montr\u00e9al, we'll go to Keith Bachman.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Peter: Could you talk a little bit about the forces impacting your sequential decline and gross margins by, call it, 350 basis points? What are the forces that you're -- want to call out and things that we should be thinking about? Thank you.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Sequential decline is primarily being driven by the higher mix of iPad sales, which, as you know, we priced very aggressively to capitalize on our first mover advantage. Additionally, we would expect to lose some leverage from the lower sequential revenue. And as I pointed out in my prepared remarks in a moment ago, the iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.7 million units in the March quarter. It acts within our 4 to 6 week range. Conversely, the iPad channel inventory fell by 400,000 units, and we were below our 4 to 6 week inventory range. So those are the forces I would highlight.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. And then perhaps 1 for Tim on my follow-up related to Shannon's question, how are you seeing different opportunities in the large enterprises with your MacBook in traditional markets of U.S. and Western Europe, given the seemingly greater receptiveness towards your iPhones, and what will be the tablets, I think. In other words, is that opening doors to go ahead and get the Macs in with CIOs?\nTimothy Cook: It clearly seems to be creating a halo effect for the Mac. And I think that's 1 reason we see the growth that we are seeing on the Mac. It's amazing when you see the 28% year-over-year versus the worldwide market in PCs contracting by 3 points. It's an astonishing delta.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Right, right. Okay, thanks very much guys.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Keith.\nOperator: From Barclays, we'll hear from Ben Reitzes.\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Yes, thanks a lot. Can you talk about the ASP trends for the iPad and the iPhone? What were they in the quarter? And are there any dynamics that would change that as we move throughout the year or at least into the June quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Ben, it's Peter. For competitive reasons, I don't want to provide any more precise ASPs for either of these products. We just don't want to help our competitors. But on the data summary, we provide you both the iPhone and iPad units that we shipped and revenues, which include the accessories that you can make your own estimate.\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Okay. And I guess my other question was with regard to the iPad constraints. When do you think that you'll be to equilibrium or have channel inventory where you need it to be? You were able to say that you increased production a lot for the iPhone. When can you say at least the same thing for the iPad where you feel like you've alleviated your shortage?\nTimothy Cook: Ben, what I would say is this, I am confident we're going to produce a very large number for the quarter. Whether that will be enough to meet demand, I don't know. Demand has been staggering. I'm not going to predict when supply and demand will come into balance. I can only be confident on the supply side.\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: We'll hear from Scott Craig with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nScott Craig: Thanks. Tim, can you maybe talk a little bit about the CDMA phone and maybe specifically, which new markets you're looking at entering with CDMA over the next couple of quarters? And then with regards to the facility investments, can you maybe talk about the magnitude of spending you expect as you go through the year on -- with the partners, I mean, sort of in investments both on a CapEx side that you're making as well as overall investments? Thanks.\nTimothy Cook: On the carrier side, I don't want to get into specifics about the CDMA or GSM for that matter. But we are constantly looking at where we should bring on incremental partners. And as we have said earlier, we brought on 3 this quarter, 3 large ones with Verizon, SKT and Saudi Telecom. That's on top of the ones that we brought on in December where we added O2 and Vodafone in Germany. And so we are constantly looking and adding where it makes sense, and you can keep confidence that we'll continue to do that.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Scott, on your capital question, a couple of updates. We expect to spend in our fiscal '11 about $5.7 billion in capital expenditures. That's unchanged from what we told you last quarter. We expect about $700 million of that to be in our retail area and $5 billion outside of retail. Some of the bigger areas outside of retail and the biggest is in the operations area. We talked about on the last call arrangements we had done with 3 suppliers. We expect to spend about $3.5 billion during fiscal '11 and fiscal '12 with those 3 suppliers on those deals in the form of prepayments and capital expenditures. And as I said in my prepared comments, we expected $900 million of that in the March quarter, and we expect to spend the remainder across fiscal '11 and fiscal '12.\nScott Craig: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: We'll go to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Yes, thanks very much. It may not be a perfect analogy but just wondering with the rise of Android, what might be some of the similarities and differences you see versus the rise of Windows PCs in the 1990s versus Mac? And I'm just wondering if you think in the U.S., particularly Android, could become a possible headwind to your U.S. smartphone business, and how do you maintain such incredible growth in the space of that shift?\nTimothy Cook: I think, Mike, I just saw yesterday -- it's interesting you should point out the U.S. The comScore data released yesterday reported that the iOS platform outreaches Android by 59% in the U.S., and so this is an enormous percentage. On a worldwide basis, we just did 18.6 million iPhones, which is up 113%, which is materially faster than the market rate of growth. And we launched the iPad 2 and sold everyone of them that we could make. As we've said before, we're gaining traction in Enterprise on both the iPhone and iPad with astonishing 88% and 75%, respectively, of the Fortune 500 companies deploying or testing these. We've got the largest App Store with over 350,000 apps for iPhone and over 65,000 iPad-specific apps on iOS versus what appears to be fewer than 100 on Android. And so we feel very, very good about where we are and we feel great about our future product plan. We've also paid over $2 billion to developers, and we've had well over 10 billion applications downloaded. And so our business proposition is very, very strong. And as we've said before, we continue to believe and even more and more everyday that iPhone's integrated approach is materially better than Android's fragmented approach, where you have multiple OSs on multiple devices with different screen resolutions and multiple app stores with different roles, payment methods and update strategies. I think the user appreciates that Apple can take full responsibility for their experience, whereas the fragmented approach turns the customer into a systems integrator and few customers that I know want to be a systems integrator.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: Okay, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: And a question first on the iPhone. Demand, obviously, has been phenomenal. And if we look down the road at the opportunity in the post- versus the prepaid markets, are there any considerations that you can share in terms of -- that you weigh, in terms of price or subsidies or growing market share in this large prepaid market?\nTimothy Cook: Gene, it's Tim. Our focus has very much been on China. We wanted to understand that market and understand the levers there. And as I said before, we're -- iPhone sales were up over 3x during the quarter. And in the first half, we did over 5 -- just slightly under $5 billion in Greater China in revenue, which is about 10% of Apple, to put it in perspective. And it wasn't but a couple of years ago that, that number would have been less than 2. And so it's a sea change. And that's certainly not, what I would call, a classic post-pay market by any means of the imagination. And so we have some ideas about other countries as well. I'm not in a position that I want to share those today. But we purposely put the bulk of our emphasis from an emerging market point of view on China to really learn, and then we're going to take that learning to other markets.\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: Would you know if China, if more than half of -- do you know if more than half of China is prepaid?\nTimothy Cook: I think considerably more than half of China's prepaid, Gene. I think the first digit would start with a 9.\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: Okay. Very, very good. And then separately, it's great to see Steve attending the iPad 2 event. And since going on medical leave, how closely has he stayed involved with the company's decisions, and do you have any idea when he might return?\nTimothy Cook: He is still on medical leave, as you say, but we do see him on a regular basis. And as we previously said, he continues to be involved in major strategic decisions. And I know he wants to be back full-time as soon as he can.\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: Great. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Gene.\nOperator: Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: I wanted to revisit the supply question on both iPhone and iPad. So last quarter, you were chasing iPhone demand, and you said you're going to work as hard as possible to try and make sure you catch up with your demand, and given the inventory build, it sounds like you're comfortable and you've gotten there. On the iPad side, it's a little less clear to me. You made, I guess, over 7 million iPads in last quarter in fiscal Q1. This quarter, including the inventory drawdown, maybe there were 5.1 million made. So was this -- I mean, you've proven that you have the capacity or the relationships to build a lot more. Was this simply a forecasting error on the iPad side? And can you comment about linearity of demand and why you couldn't have kept production at a similar rate to the prior quarter and been able to fulfill a lot more?\nTimothy Cook: Let me mention a few things for you to consider, Toni. First off, product transitions are never simple. And as you can probably appreciate, we are in a position that we have to call them for many, many weeks in advance in terms of how many of the current product we want to produce and the dates at which we will announce the new product. We drew the channel down on the current product or the original iPad, I should say, by 570,000 units during the quarter. And we added at the end of the quarter 170,000 of the new iPad 2s although most of that was in transit at the end of the quarter. And so the net reduction was $400,000. And so our sell-through was above $5 million for the quarter. And again, this has to be planned quite a ways in the future. I think the key point here is -- also the dates, just to remind you, we set out an invitation to the event toward the end of February. We had the event in early March. We placed the unit on sale in the United States on March 11 and our quarter ended about 2 weeks thereafter. And so there was some expectation of a new product, and we would have obviously factored that into our thinking about the product transition as we plan the number of the original unit to build. And so I think the key point here is that I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we were making on the manufacturing ramp. We have gotten off to a materially better start and produced a lot more units than we did on the original ramp of the first iPad. And when we're so confident with our ability to supply that we've already put on 25 additional countries at the end of March, and we'll be placing on 13 more next week and we'll do even more as we stepped through the quarter.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. If I could turn to another topic, which is just your overall guidance for next quarter on the revenue and EPS side. If I look back at your last 8 quarters, Q2 to Q3, last 8 years. 7 of the 8, you've been flat to up in revenues. And 8 out of 8, you've been up in EPS sequentially from Q2 to Q3. On both those metrics, you're providing guidance that is dramatically down double digits. Can you comment on forces at work? Obviously, you're typically pretty conservative in your guidance. But what are the things that are kind of underpinning those directionally, those assumptions, particularly since you're pointing to a dramatic increase in iPads?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. Toni, it's Peter. Let me start with top line. I would highlight 2 things. First of all, our sequential revenue guidance of $23 million is for a 7% decline, and it have been up in prior years. And 2 things to point out: first of all, in our most recent March quarter, we were able to increase the iPhone channel inventory by 1.7 million units and within our target range. And that had not occurred in any of the prior years. And second, last year, we launched the iPad in the year ago June quarter, and it was a fabulous launch contributing $2.2 billion in revenue without a comparison to the prior March quarter, and we obviously have that comparison this year. On a year-over-year basis, I am very pleased we're providing revenue guidance for growth of 46% year-over-year and EPS growing almost as quickly at 43%.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Toni.\nOperator: We'll go to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG: Thanks very much. Just a follow-up on the iPad question. Can you give us a split of iPad 2 versus iPad 1 as a percentage of the 5 million you shipped in the March quarter?\nTimothy Cook: We purposely aren't giving that because we don't want to help out any of our competition. But I would tell you, I wish we could have produced a lot more iPad 2s because there were certainly a lot of people waiting for them.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG: Secondly, the follow-up on the sequential revenue guidance question. Can you provide any color what you expect from Macs, particularly as we enter the educational buying season? Have you seen any pressure on school budgets that is creating a little caution with respect to your Mac business?\nPeter Oppenheimer: It's a difficult funding environment for schools here in the U.S. We don't see any evidence of a share loss. And Macs are very of popular in schools and iPads are proving to be as well. On a year-over-year basis, we would expect to see a sequential -- I'm sorry, a year-over-year very significant increase in Mac sales, and I'm very confident about the product lines as we head into the back-to-school season.\nTimothy Cook: 1 thing I would add to that, this was surprising to me and I think several people here is, K-12 is sort of even more conservative than Enterprise on adopting new technology. And last quarter, we were about a 1:1 ratio of iPads to Macs, which is I think very -- is amazing with the short life of the iPad, and really demonstrates what kind of opportunity there probably is there.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: Brian Blair with Wedge Partners.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: Thank you. For the last several years, we've seen a new iPhone in June and we've seen a new iPod models in September. Can you maybe just share some of your views on how you've historically viewed that 1 year time horizon for new products, and maybe talk about what might cause that kind of a time line to change?\nTimothy Cook: We don't -- we never comment on an Apps products, and so I don't have anything to share from that perspective.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: And then can you -- you've touched on it a little bit, but can you maybe give some updated thoughts on how you view the supply-demand balance right now for the iPhone? You've talked a bit about it with iPad but 1 of the things that really stuck out to me in the last few quarters is your -- just the demand has been so great globally, especially if you've added new carriers that you still haven't met demand for the iPhone. Can you maybe just give some updated thoughts on that?\nTimothy Cook: Yes, that's a good question. We -- by the end of the quarter, we were in supply-demand balance in almost all of our major markets. And I would say as of today, we're in supply-demand balance virtually everywhere. The other products, the Mac is in supply-demand balance and the iPod is in supply-demand balance. And the iPad has the mother of all backlogs that we're working very, very hard to get out to customers as quickly as we can.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: Great. Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: From Pacific Crest, we'll go to Andy Hargreaves.\nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Just going back to the supply stuff real quick. Can you clarify -- would it require some kind of new disruption to cause problems beyond fiscal Q3, or were your comments just that we could kind of run low on inventory, and if production doesn't get back to full capacity, there could be issues later in the year?\nTimothy Cook: Sorry, I wasn't trying to be unclear. I'm saying that as of today, we currently do not anticipate any material supply or cost, in fact, as far as that goes in our fiscal Q3. That's the quarter that we're in now that ends in June. Beyond June, there are risks but there's no issue that we're aware of today that we view as unsolvable. However, new things could happen and I'm sure you've been paying attention to the news. There's aftershocks, there's still uncertainty about the nuclear plant, there's power interruptions. If that stayed at the level it is today, I'm not as worried. I would worry if something happened and took a turn for the worse. And obviously, I can't predict that and certainly hope that it does not occur.\nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks. And then just on the iPhone, you talked a lot about the number of new Mac customers every quarter. Can you give us any help on what the mix is of replacement sales versus new customers, or what your total user base is there?\nTimothy Cook: It's a number that we haven't given out before, and so it's a number that we hold tight to the best.\nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.: Okay, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Andy.\nOperator: We'll go to Shaw Wu with Sterne Agee.\nShaw Wu - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Thanks for having me on. Just 2 quick ones. Just back on components, it seems if you look at other vendors and spot pricing, component pricing has actually been increasing. I just wanted a little more color why Apple has been able to beat that. I know you're a very well-run company, obviously. Just a little more color on that.\nTimothy Cook: Yes, it's a good question, Shaw. Certainly, spot markets have spiked. This is particularly true if you follow the NAND Flash and the DRAM markets. However, we do not typically buy in the spot market. And so, for that reason, we see very minimal impact. Beyond Q3, I'm saying I'm not sure because it's tough to see that far, but for Q3, we feel very good. Companies that buy on the spot market would obviously be seeing something extremely differently than we would.\nShaw Wu - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay, thanks for the color on that. And then just on the iPad, in terms of the selling model, does it make sense or is there interest in terms of having it subsidized by service providers at some point?\nTimothy Cook: The iPad today is subsidized in a few markets. It is subsidized in Korea if people sign a 24-month contract, it's subsidized in Japan with a 24-month contract and a couple of European countries. But the vast majority of people that are using the iPad on 3G are doing so on a pay-as-you-go plan and no commitment plan. And so, yes, carriers can do that but I think many customers prefer the pay-as-you-go plan.\nShaw Wu - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.: Okay, thanks.\nTimothy Cook: Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shaw.\nOperator: From UBS, we'll go to Maynard Um.\nMaynard Um - UBS Investment Bank: Thank you. 2 questions. Last year, when you gave gross margin guidance for the fiscal third quarter, I think you -- 1 thing you mentioned was a new product transition that would impact the gross margins. Just curious if that's also a factor. You didn't mention that. And then secondly, if you could just talk a little bit about the suit against Samsung. I'm just wondering how that might impact anything on your component-supply relationship? Thanks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: I'll take your gross margin question, it's Peter. It's hard for us to comment on gross margin changes year-over-year because we're in different product cycles, commodity environments, different mixes and other factors. So I prefer just to talk about it sequentially, and I gave you really the biggest drivers of the change that we see. We expect to have a sequential increase in terms of our mix of iPad sales and also expect our revenues to be down sequentially a little bit and to lose some leverage. So those are the factors that I think are important on a sequential basis for those margin.\nTimothy Cook: And on your question on Samsung, we are Samsung's largest customer and Samsung is a very valued component supplier to us, and I expect the strong relationship will continue. Separately from this, we felt the Mobile Communication Division of Samsung had crossed the line. And after trying for some time to work the issue, we decided we needed to rely on the courts.\nMaynard Um - UBS Investment Bank: Great, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Maynard.\nOperator: We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JP Morgan.\nMark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Yes, thanks. Tim, you mentioned earlier about the success of the iTunes here. Can you talk a little philosophically about what will be [ph] the next to really optimize that platform in terms of cloud-like capabilities? And then, Peter, the question for you is really around the OpEx. How should we think about OpEx? Does your guidance already imply that you will have to increase some S&M employees to serve these greater region enterprises? Or is that already kind of in the model?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I'll take both your questions. We don't talk about what we'll do in the future, so I'm quite limited to what we can say about the future of iTunes. We operate the most popular store in the world, giving customers a fabulous experience. We have the largest libraries and have provided more content to more customers than anybody. We're very confident about what we're doing and what we will do in the future. I can't take it beyond there. In terms of OpEx, we've provided guidance for the June quarter, about $2.5 billion, and that includes our thinking for the investment that we're going to make in the quarter for the business. We are investing in engineering, in our retail stores, we are investing in our indirect distribution, which it would include covering the enterprise and the infrastructure investment that we need to support the terrific growth that you're seeing from the company. I'm glad that we are making good investments that are paying off but also providing -- continuing to provide leverage in the model.\nMark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Mark.

[Operator Instructions] At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2010, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC this afternoon along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information or speak as of their respective date. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Apple's CFO, Peter Oppenheimer, for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We are very pleased to report the outstanding results of our December quarter. The performance of our business was extremely strong, as we sold more Macs, iPhones and iPads than in any previous quarter in Apple's history. And as a result, we're thrilled to announce all-time record quarterly revenue and earnings.  Revenue for the quarter was $26.7 billion, an increase of more than $11 billion over the prior December quarter's result, representing growth of 71%. The robust revenue growth was fueled by record iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. Operating margin was over $7.8 billion, representing 29.3% of revenue. Net income was $6 billion, which exceeded our previous quarterly earnings record set in the September quarter by $1.7 billion, and represented 78% growth over the year-ago quarter's earnings. These results translated to earnings per share of $6.43.  Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new quarterly record with sales of 4.13 million Macs, representing 23% growth over the year-ago quarter. That's almost 8x IDC's most recently published estimate of 3% growth for the PC market. We experienced strong sales growth in each of our geographic segments, with over 50% growth in both the Asia-Pacific region and Japan. The growth was fueled primarily by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, which was launched in October, as well as continued strong sales of MacBook Pro. Customers love the new thin and light unibody design of the MacBook Air, and the impressive responsiveness and reliability of its solid-state storage, while MacBook Pro continues to provide customers tremendous speed and high-performance graphics at an excellent value.  We ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory. We opened the Mac App Store in January 6, bringing what we've learned from iOS Apps to Mac users to make discovering, installing and updating apps easier than ever. The Mac App Store is available in 90 countries, and features more than 1,000 free and paid apps in categories like education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity and utility. We've been very pleased with customer response, with over 1 million downloads on the first day alone.  Moving to our music products. We sold 19.4 million iPods compared to 21 million in the year-ago quarter. We experienced continued strong sales of iPod touch, which grew 27% year-over-year and accounted for over 50% of all iPods sold during the quarter. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory.  The iTunes Store generated another strong quarter with revenue exceeding $1.1 billion, thanks to strong sales of music, video and apps. We were extremely pleased to bring the legendary music of the Beatles to iTunes during the quarter and to introduce movies to the iTunes Store in Japan. And as we announced a few weeks ago, iTunes users are now renting and purchasing over 400,000 TV episodes and over 150,000 movies per day.  I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to have sold 16.2 million iPhones compared to 8.7 million in the previous December quarter. This represents 86% year-over-year growth compared to IDC's latest published estimate of 70% growth for the global smartphone market overall in the December quarter. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $10.47 billion during the quarter, compared to $5.58 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 88%.  The sales value of iPhones alone was over $10.1 billion, which yields an ASP of about $625. At the end of the December quarter, we had iPhone distributions through 185 carriers in 90 countries. We continue to experience very strong year-over-year growth in all of our segments, with sales in the Asia-Pacific region and Japan both more than doubling year-over-year.  Enterprise customers continue to embrace iPhone, with 88 of the Fortune 100 companies and almost 60% of the Financial Times Europe 100 companies now testing or deploying iPhones. Strong employee demand in custom app development are fueling deployment within the corporate sector.  Enterprise CIOs continue to add iPhone to their approved device list worldwide. Most recently, Fortune 500, like Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, DuPont, Staples, Starbucks and Genworth Financial, and Global 500 accounts such as Nissan Motor, BBVA [Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria], Standard Chartered Group and Danone, have made iPhone available to their employees.  We ended the quarter with about 3.5 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 250k. We continue to have a sizable backlog, and believe we could have sold even more iPhones if we had been able to supply them. And we're thrilled to begin working with Verizon next month to offer iPhone 4 to its more than 93 million customers, as well as to new customers who want iPhone 4 on Verizon.  Turning to iPad. We continue to be thrilled with its momentum and customer interest. We sold 7.3 million iPads, a sequential increase of over 3 million, with distribution in 46 countries by the end of the December quarter. We continue to see great enthusiasm for iPads from consumer, business and education customers. Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment remains strong, and the response to the product continues to be significant.  Enterprise CIOs are adding iPad to their approved device list at an amazing rate. Today, over 80% of the Fortune 100 are already deploying or piloting iPad, up from 65% in the September quarter. Some recent examples include JPMorgan Chase, Cardinal Health, Wells Fargo, Archer Daniels Midland, Sears Holdings and DuPont.  Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $4.61 billion. The sales value by iPads alone was over $4.4 billion, which yields an ASP of about $600. We increased the supply of iPads during the quarter and expanded both the number of countries and the number of channel partners carrying iPad.  Channel inventory increased by about 525,000 units from the beginning to the end of the quarter to support increased sales and channel expansion, and we ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we reached over 160 million cumulative iOS device sales through the end of the December quarter.  In November, we launched iOS 4.2, which brings over 100 new features to iPad users including multitasking, folders, unified inbox, Game Center, AirPlay and AirPrint.  The App Store continues to be incredibly successful, with over 300,000 apps available and well over 9 billion downloads to date. We continue to be very pleased with iAd, which combines the narrative quality of TV ads with the interactivity of digital to provide a new kind of advertising experience. During the quarter, we expanded iAds beyond the U.S. to Europe and Japan and provided iAd Producer to marketers.  I'd now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores, which had a record-breaking quarter. Retail revenue almost doubled year-over-year to $3.85 billion compared to $1.97 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 95%. iPad sales in our stores were very strong in the first holiday quarter. The stores also delivered a record Mac quarter, selling 851,000 Macs compared to 689,000 Macs in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 24%. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. International Retail Store sales were particularly strong with our average international store volume exceeding our very productive average U.S. store volume.  Additionally, our four stores in China were, on average, our highest traffic and our highest revenue stores in the world. We opened six stores during the December quarter, bringing us to a total of 323 stores worldwide at the quarter end, with 87 of them outside the United States.  With an average of 321 stores opened during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $12 million compared to $7.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 69%.  Retail segment margin exceeded $1 billion for the first time and more than doubled from $481 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted a record 75.7 million visitors in our stores during the quarter, compared to 50.9 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 49%.  Total company gross margin was 38.5%, which was about 250 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better commodity cost than we had planned. The remainder of the difference was due to the leverage on the higher revenue and lower other product costs, including freight, warranty and phone support.  Operating expenses were $2.47 billion and included $247 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $136 million, ahead of our guidance primarily due to the positive impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates from net asset. The tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, below our guidance of 25.5% due to the one-time benefit of the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit from January 1, 2010. We expect our tax rate for the remaining quarters of fiscal '11 to be about 25.5%.  Turning to cash. Our cash, plus short-term and long-term marketable securities, totaled $59.7 billion at the end of the December quarter, compared to $51 billion at the end of the September quarter, an increase of $8.7 billion. Cash flow from operations was $9.8 billion, an increase of 69% year-over-year.  During the September and December quarters, we executed long-term supply agreements with three vendors through which we expect to spend a total of approximately $3.9 billion in inventory component prepayments and capital expenditures over a two-year period. We made approximately $650 million in payments under these agreements in the December quarter, and anticipate making $1.05 billion in payments in the March quarter.  As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $22 billion, compared to $13.5 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect gross margins to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $50 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $2.35 billion, including about $250 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $50 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. We are targeting EPS of about $4.90.  In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record-breaking results and customer response to our products. We look forward to expanding the reach of the iPhone in the United States with the addition of Verizon, and we remain very confident in our strategy and our new product pipeline. And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. Also joining us for Q&A are Apple COO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: I have a question for you with regard to availability of iPhones, especially with the Verizon launch. I think you mentioned that there was a backlog that you weren't able to meet in the December quarter. So I don't know if, Tim and Peter, if you could talk a little bit about what you're doing to ensure that you have sufficient quantities of iPhones and any changes you've made to ensure more component availability?\nTimothy Cook: Shannon, it's Tim. As I mentioned on the last quarter's call, we made a very bold bet, taking iPhone capacity for the September quarter with the new iPhone 4 in the lineup to 14 million. And as you may remember, we sold over 14 million in that quarter in total iPhones, so it was a fantastic quarter. And that was up from a previous number that with the 8-ish million range. We were able to step that up in this past quarter to over 16 million, as Peter said in his opening remarks. And so we were able to increase over 2 million. And we\u2019re, obviously, have continued to work on increasing this further. But as with all good things, it takes some time to do that. Relative to Verizon, we are thrilled to offer the iPhone 4 to Verizon with 93 million customers, as well as any new customers who want an iPhone 4 on Verizon. And we're going to do everything possible to get the iPhones into as many hands of those customers as possible.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: And then I just had one follow up, with regard to the Mac App Store, which clearly just started, though I'm not sure how much you'll talk about it. But we've noticed your best-selling apps tend to be Apple software-based, Apple software apps. So how should we think about the Mac App Store? Any initial thoughts you have on it and initial things you've seen?\nTimothy Cook: It's just getting going, but we are thrilled to have reported over 1 million in a very short amount of time. And so we're very happy with the start of it.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley: First question for Tim, how comfortable are you right now with the availability of iPhones and iPads? And if you still see shortages, how quickly do you think they can be addressed early this year?\nTimothy Cook: Katy, let me take each one of those separately. On iPad, we increased dramatically last quarter. We sold 7.3 million the previous quarter, we were in the low 4s as you know. That did get us into supply-demand balance and also allowed us to expand to 46 countries, or to a total of 46 by the end of the quarter, which added 20 during the quarter. And we're confident enough to add another 15 countries during the month of January that will take us over 60. And so we feel very, very good about the progress that we've made here. Relative to iPhone 4, I also feel very, very good about what we've been able to do. However, it's not enough. We do still have a significant backlog. We are working around-the-clock to build more. I feel great that the demand is so high, but at this point, I'm not going to predict when supply and demand will meet. We believe the reaction and results from the Verizon customers will be huge, and so I don't want to give a prediction right now when the supply and demand will cross.\nKathryn Huberty - Morgan Stanley: And then Tim, one of the most impressive metrics is the sequential on your growth of Asia-Pacific. Can you just talk about what's driving that and what plans you have in place, going forward, to sustain that growth?\nTimothy Cook: Yes. That's a very good question. First of all, let me say that of the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China, we, several years ago, identified China as our top priority, and we put enormous energy into China. And the results of that has been absolutely staggering. To give you some numbers there and some specifics, we look at Greater China as a region. And Greater China, just for clarity, is mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The revenue from Greater China for Apple for last quarter was $2.6 billion, which was up 4x from the prior year quarter. And to further, just an exclamation point by that, we did a little over $3 billion for the entire year, fiscal year 2010. And so we're very, very proud of the team and the results that we've gotten there. Korea has also been a very, very good market for us. We had an outstanding Q1 there, primarily driven by iPhone and iPads. And there are several other Asian countries doing extremely well. Japan is not in the segment that you're looking out, but Japan by itself, the revenue was up 83% year-over-year. And if you're familiar with the Japanese economy and the growth there, to grow 83% on the base that we're doing is stunning. And so we are placing more and more resource in these areas and continue to look for expansion possibilities throughout Asia.\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: Question for Tim in terms of the long-term business planning. There's been a lot of questions in terms of how far out you guys actually planned it. I was wondering if there's any insight you can give us in terms of what your long-term business plan is in terms of a product road map. Obviously, you can't share what that road map is. But how far will you guys go in Retail Stores and so forth? Is it a one-year plan, is it a five-year plan, is it -- any sort of insight would be helpful?\nTimothy Cook: Well, Gene, that's part of the magic of Apple. And I don't want to let anybody know our magic because I don't want anybody copying it. What I would tell you is that in my view, Apple is doing its best work ever, that we are all very happy with the product pipeline. And the team here has an unparalleled breadth and depth of talent and a culture of innovation that Steve has driven in the company, and excellence has become a habit. And so we feel very, very confident about the future of the company. I would also note to those people that haven't thought about it is we've done outstanding in our Mac business. We've had 19 quarters straight of growing faster than the market, but we still have a relatively low share of a very large PC market despite having great momentum there. And so it would seem like there's enormous opportunity still there. We have a relatively low share in the handset market. The handset market is well over 1 billion units a year, and the smartphone market is growing faster than a weed. And so there's enormous opportunity here, and we have incredible momentum in that space. iPad just got started, it's a new category. We sold almost 15 million through the first three quarters, and we believe the market is huge. IDC, I saw this morning, is predicting it to quadruple in two years. I don't know what to predict in terms of specific numbers. However, we believe it's a huge market, as we've said before. And so we're in some great markets, some fast-moving markets, we have the best products we've ever done and an incredible product pipeline. We feel very, very confident.\nCharles Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies: And just a follow-up for Peter, in terms of iPhones, you mentioned that if not for production constraints, you could've sold more. Is there any way to help us kind of back into how many more?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, you can't run the experiment both ways, that's -- the demand for iPhone has just been incredible. We could not make enough in the quarter, and we would've loved to have ended with more channel inventory than we did.\nOperator: From Citigroup, we'll hear from Richard Gardner.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc: I was just hoping that you could talk about what components were better than you thought in terms of price during the quarter? And then Tim, if you could give us your thoughts on the commodity environment going into the March quarter, given that flat panels are below cash costs for some providers. What are you looking for going into the March quarter, please?\nTimothy Cook: Rich, in terms of the go-forward in March quarter and what is embedded in the guidance that Peter gave earlier is that we expect a favorable pricing environment for DRAM, where supply exceeds the demand still. Some prices for raw materials such as key metals is currently increasing due to the anticipated strengthening of the worldwide economy, and it remains to be seen whether that continues. The bulk of the other commodities from NAND Flash to batteries to HDDs to ODDs to LCDs and most other commodities are generally in a supply-demand balance. And so we would expect this group of commodities to fall in prices consistent with their historical trends. In terms of what we saw last quarter, frankly speaking, in most areas, we saw a favorability and it was a key part of us overachieving our guidance gross margin.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc: And actually, Tim, if I could follow up, can you talk about which component areas you're making long-term commitments in on supply?\nTimothy Cook: It's something I don't want to give out, Rich, because I view it as a competitive -- something I just don't want our competition knowing. But let me talk about it in general and hopefully, that will suffice. From our point of view on the design side, we design components where we believe we can innovate beyond what's available in the market. And the most recent example of this is the A4 chip. But with the A4 chip, we didn't feel like we had to invest in the fab itself and build the fab because we felt like they were good options in the market for doing that, but not good options in terms of buying a design, and so we really focused on design. On the operational side of the house, as you probably remember, we've historically entered into certain agreements with different people to secure supply and other benefits. And the largest one in the recent past has been we signed a deal with several Flash suppliers back at the end of 2005 that totaled over $1 billion because we anticipated that Flash would become increasingly important across our entire product line and increasingly important to the industry. And so we wanted to secure supply for the company, and we think that, that was an absolutely fantastic use of Apple's cash. And we constantly look for more of these. And so in the past several quarters we've identified another area and come to some recent agreements that Peter talked about in his opening comments, in that these payments consist of both prepayments and capital for process equipment and tooling. And similar to the Flash agreements, they're focused in an area we feel is very strategic. And so I'd prefer not to go into more detail about what specific area it's in, but it's the same kind of thinking that led us to those deals that led us to the Flash deal.\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Bill Shope.\nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Guys, in the past, your build materials for key devices has generally come down at a rate that allowed for fairly healthy gross margin expansion over time. And I'd say this has generally been true for iPod refreshes in the past, iPhone refreshes. Is there anything different about the iPad that we should consider going forward, that would make it difficult for margins to follow this historical pattern? And did you see some of this in the most recent quarter as well?\nTimothy Cook: Bill, margins consist of a number different factors like which direction the commodity markets are going? Where the product is within the product life cycle, as well as the value engineering that we do and the negotiating and so forth we do. And so I don't think that you can take a single product kind of out by itself and speak about it with any accuracy. And as you know, we don't guide at the product level on margin. We're confident with the guidance that Peter provided on gross margin in his opening comments.\nPeter Oppenheimer: And I would ask of that, that we have always aggressively worked to lower our costs. I think we have a good track record in this regard, and we shipped a lot of iPads in the December quarter, and have very strong gross margins. So I think we were quite happy with our progress.\nBill Shope - J.P. Morgan: On the iPad side again. Now that you've had the opportunity over the past few weeks to see more detail specs and in some cases, the price points for all the countless tablet devices coming into 2011. Can you comment on how you're currently dealing with competitive landscape for the iPad and how, if that's changed, if at all, over the past few months?\nTimothy Cook: Well, and if you're look at what's shipping today, there's not much out there as you know. And generally speaking, there's two kinds of groups today, that are at least on the market today. The ones that are using a Windows-based operating system are generally fairly big and heavy and expensive. They have very weak battery life, they require a keyboard or a stylus as an input device. And from our point of view and what we've seen, customers, frankly, just are not interested in them. Then you have the Android tablet, and the variety that are out shipping today, the operating system wasn't really designed for a tablet. And Google has said this, and so this is not just an Apple view by any means. And so you wind up having a size of a tablet that is less than what we believe is reasonable or even one that would provide what we feel is a real tablet experience. And so basically, you wind up with kind of a scaled-up smartphone, which is a bizarre product in our view. Then you've got kind of a third group -- and so those are the two that are shipping today. And frankly speaking, it's hard for me to understand if somebody does a side-by-side with an iPad, I think some enormous percentage of people are going to select an iPad there. Those are not tablets that we have any concern on. The next-generation Android tablets, which are primarily what you mentioned in terms of the CES, there's nothing shipping yet, and so I don't know. Generally, they lack performance specs, they lack prices, they lack timing. And so today, they're vapor. We'll assess them as they come out. However, we're not sitting still. And we have a huge first-mover advantage. And we have an incredible user experience from iTunes to the App Store, and an enormous number of apps and a huge ecosystem. And so we're very, very confident with entering into a fight with anyone.\nOperator: From Sanford Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.\nToni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research: You've said on previous earnings calls that the move to iPhone non-exclusivity in regions of the world has had no impact on your ASPs. Can you comment on whether that is it still the case today and whether we should expect any impact in the migration away from U.S. exclusivity? And related to that, there are several large carriers globally that the iPhone is still not offered in. Can you talk about some of the reasons why that isn't the case? Many of them are CDMA-based. And given that you now have a CDMA-based offering, is it unreasonable to expect that we should see more CDMA carriers going forward?\nTimothy Cook: Toni, it's Tim. Relative to the ASP, I generally would not do this. And I want to be specific, that this comment isn't related to the U.S. or any specific carrier or any specific region. But to specifically answer your question, I don't envision the overall iPhone ASP decreasing from the December quarter that we just completed to the March quarter that we're currently in. And as you know, as our long-standing practice has been, we don't comment on after, after that period of time. Relative to other carriers, yes, we're always looking and assessing in every country who we should be doing business with and exploring different deals and arrangements, et cetera. And so we'll continue to do that. What I've said before and we have seen this in every case, literally, that we've done, is where we've moved from a exclusive carrier arrangement to a dual- or multi-carrier arrangement, our growth has changed significantly and our market share has increased. And so that doesn't mean that would happen in every country nor does it mean that we're just out doing that in every country. We look at each one individual because each market has its own individual characteristics and parameters and technology. On the CDMA phone, specifically, I don't have any specific thing to announce today other than we're truly thrilled to be working with the Verizon team. They have built quite a company and earned a great deal of respect from the customers, and some of them have waited a long time to get iPhone. And we're very, very happy to give them iPhone, and any other customers that are non-Verizon customers who wish to buy an iPhone. We're also very happy that we've signed a multi-year non-inclusive deal with AT&T. And so we're very happy that we'll have shortly a dual-carrier setup in the United States.\nToni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research: Tim, if I could follow-up on that, given your previous comments on China and the importance of that country strategically for you and the investments that you're making in stores, et cetera, can you may be use that as a case study for why you're only in one carrier there? I think you've said that there are no longer any exclusive conditions that you have in place globally with any carriers. So can you talk about other either impediments or hindrances beyond technology, of which CDMA is one, that may be limiting your ability to sign important carrier agreements in potentially very important and strategic areas for the company?\nTimothy Cook: Toni, I generally found people really want to do business with us, and their customers are very much desiring to have the iPhone. And so I don't really see a lack of desire. I don't want to comment about any specific country because I view any conversations that we have going confidential in nature. It is true, as you said, that we are not under a contractual exclusivity now in any country in the world. The last one was the United States. We have moved away from those. I can guarantee you that we always are looking at opportunities to grow. Of course, in the very short-term, I would also remind you that we're constrained on iPhone 4, and we're working around the clock to get as many of these out to our existing partners as we can.\nOperator: We'll go to Brian Blair with Wedge Partners.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: Can you maybe give us your updated thoughts on the Mac side and maybe specifically address the impact of iPads? With the tremendous iPad unit this quarter, the cannibalization question is going to come up. And I just want to get your latest thoughts on that, if we could?\nTimothy Cook: That's a good question. What we saw in the Mac this quarter was we grew 23% at the worldwide level, and that is compared to a market growth of only 3%. And so we grew almost 8x the market rate of growth, which is, I think, stunning. And every region outgrew the market, so it wasn't just one region. Asia-Pacific led the growth with a whopping 67% year-over-year increase, and that's almost 10x what market did there, to put it in context. Japan grew at 56%, which is about 6x the market, and Europe and the United States both grew in double-digits despite both markets contracting overall. And so we did significantly better than the market in every major region, and we're very proud of that. Now was there any cannibalization by iPad? Honestly, I don't know for sure. But yes, I think there is some cannibalization. But I also think there's a halo effect. As we've seen on the Mac by the iPod some years ago, I think there is a halo effect from Apple product to Apple product. And of course, we have introduced millions of people in Asia to Apple through the iPhone. And we're now introducing many more through the iPad, and I think some of those decide to buy a Mac. And so when you look at the Mac growth in Asia at 67%, and you look at the Japan growth at 56%, and you look at the U.S. and Europe growing in double-digits against shrinking markets, if this is cannibalization, it feels pretty good. The other point I would make is that if the iPad or tablets do cannibalize the PC market, keep in mind that we have low share of the PC market. And so the other guys lose a lot more, and we have a lot more to win because of that. And so honestly, cannibalization is not something that we are spending one minute on here. The iPad team are building the best iPad for the future, and the Mac teams are building the best Mac, and I can tell you that both groups believe that they can continue to grow and do great stuff, and I believe that.\nBrian Blair - Wedge Partners: And that's a great way to look at it. One of the things that's interesting to me is I see this trend of your bringing a lot more of the functionality from the tablet side, you're bringing it on to the Mac side. It was talked about earlier, the Mac App Store that's now on Mac OS X. And then as we're getting kind of teaser shots of Lion, it looks like the next OS is also taking even more kind of design and UI elements from the iPad side. So maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit, are these two platforms really merging into one? And is this the future of computing as you see it? Or is it just -- are you just kind of grabbing one or two aspects of tablets and bringing it into the OS X?\nTimothy Cook: I think one of the -- part of the magic of Apple is that there's not high walls between these product groups. They like each other, talk to each other, they're of the same DNA, they want to build the best products in the world. And so if one has a great idea, there's not a \"not invented here\" in the other group. And so one of the key learnings from the iPad was that people love instant on, they really love that. And so the MacBook Air incorporated that, and that's just one simple example. But there are tons of examples throughout all of our products, where something started on one and went to a different one. And it's not always in the same direction either. It could start on the phone, and then flow forward, it could start on the iPad and flow, and so on and so forth. And so just the part of the way we run the company. And I think Steve said it great when he said, \"If the Mac company were a separate company, and the iPad company were a separate company, what would the Mac company build to compete with the iPad? And I think the answer is the MacBook Air.\" And I think that's a phenomenal insight, and I think a great way to look at it. And it's not that the groups are competing, they are sharing and coming up with these incredible products that people really want.\nOperator: From Bank of Montreal, we'll hear from Keith Bachman.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Tim, do you have data that you've gathered on the Phone and/or the iPad on new to the brand. You typically talk about Macs in the stores, you're getting 50% new to the brand. Do you have any data related to the newness of the brand? I would assume it's substantially higher to that, but I want to hear a little bit about that. And depending on that outcome, if you talk a little bit about how you think these products, in particular, the Pad in emerging markets may help to continue drive share opportunities for you?\nTimothy Cook: I don't want to share -- do we collect it? Yes, of course, we do. The numbers for iPhone are -- there's many such numbers, they're now big because we've been shipping iPhones for a while. Any product that you ship for a while looks a little different at the prime end or in the early adopter cycle versus when you get to the mainstream. The iPad went through that cycle quickly, and moved to mainstream and enterprise and all the rest in record time. But nevertheless, that data needs to settle some, even before internally, we put a lot of weight in it. But the bulk of your question doesn't need specific numbers. To make a point, if you look at our Asia-Pacific business, the revenue growth was 175% or so. And so this is incredible. And the size of business in Asia that we've now built is massive. To do $2.6 billion in China in three months, where just two years ago, we did less than $1 billion in the whole year, it is phenomenal, or actually for the year before. And so I think we are -- it's clear that we're introducing a lot of people to Apple who previously had not been introduced to the company, and I think that helps across the product line.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: In the U.S., I'm just trying to understand how you see the tablet market more broadly having greater penetration rates, say in established markets versus emerging markets. But typically, the notion is that tablets in many cases are more about consumption versus creation. And just want to hear your thoughts, not on growth rate, but on absolute unit opportunities between the established markets and the emerging markets?\nTimothy Cook: I think that the tablet market is, the opportunity is so large, it's large everywhere, honestly. I think it\u2019s huge.\nOperator: And we'll move on to Barclays Capital, Ben Reitzes.\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: A question for Peter, I just wanted to cash out the revenue outlook. Your sequential decline of, I guess, 17% is a little more than last year's, but you have Verizon now for the iPhone. So what components, I guess, other than iPod, are expected to have to contribute to the big decline, if intuitively, maybe iPhone has some support from Verizon?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, I'll answer your question in a couple of ways. First of all, we're working hard to increase supply of iPhones. Tim has talked about that, but that will come over a period of time and not necessarily, overnight, as we said. In terms of the sequential guidance this year, let me start by saying we are thrilled to be giving you guidance for 63% revenue growth year-over-year, which will translate to a 50% earnings growth. So the business is performing extremely well. We're shipping the best products in Apple history and customer response has been tremendous. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we increased the iPhone and the iPad channel inventory by about 775,000 units, and this will have a bit of impact on the sequential compare that you referred to. In terms of the products, for Mac, we've just reported the highest Mac sales ever, and we've outgrown the market for 19 consecutive quarters. We would expect to see a sequential unit decline, which is typical for us after the holiday season. For iPod, we would also expect to see a large sequential decline, which is also typical for us after the holiday season. For iPhone, we'd expect to see a significant year-over-year increase. And for iPad, this will be our first experience, going from the December to March quarter, so we'll see. However, it was clear to us that the iPad was a hot holiday gift item, which fueled the 75% sequential growth that we saw in the December quarter. And given this, we would expect a sequential decline in the March quarter. So that's what's gone into our thinking, Ben.\nBenjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital: And then just a follow up for Tim, the last call, maybe, or one of the last calls, Steve had a lot of comments around Android and perhaps, some of its disadvantages versus your platform. Is there any other observations you'd like to make now that, we had a few more months, to see the market develop further and with Verizon, and even more tablet sales on the horizon, feedback you're getting from developers, or anything else you'd like to add on the battle with Android, kind of updating Steve's recent comments from last quarter?\nTimothy Cook: Well, if you look at the iPhone portion, we had record sales on iPhone with 16.2 million units sold in the quarter. And Peter said we believe we could've sold more if we had more supply. From the market estimates that we've seen, it suggests that we grew faster than the market. Obviously, we're working around the clock on increasing supply. We're continuing to expand countries and carriers. And I've talked a little bit of that with Toni's question. We're getting enormous enterprise traction, with 88% of the Fortune 100, which is mind-blowing, I believe. 83% of the Fortune 500, 60% of the FT 100. So the enterprise traction is gaining. We have the highest customer sat [satisfaction] ratings in the industry versus Android or RIM or any -- we have the largest App Store with over 300,000 apps. We have now sold over 160 million iOS devices. And I mean, this is huge. And we fundamentally believe that our integrated approach delivers a far superior customer experience than the fragmented approach. And you can see this in a variety of ways from the fragmentation of the number of App Stores out there that people are going to pull their hair out, because they're going to have a variety of updating methodologies, and a variety of payment methods, and slightly different derivatives. You can see from surveys, people are doing to see who is on the latest OS, and you'll notice that the iOS is always off the charts on the percentage of people that have the latest version versus the other guys. We are launching with Verizon next month. We believe there's a huge pent-up demand there, and we think that, that will help us in the U.S. And so I think I'd probably just repeat it, much of what he said before. But the net-net is we think that our integrated approach is much better for the end user because it takes out all the complexity for the end user instead of making the end user a systems integrator themselves. I don't know about you, but I don't know very many people that want to be system integrators as a consumer or somebody in the enterprise. And so I think that the more iPhones that we can get out there into people's hands, the more people love them. And I think we've got a very bright future. I think the same thing about iPad. It's the same set of issues at the end of the day. The differences on iPad, of course, is that we have a -- we've been running three quarters without any significant competition of any type. And I think that the customer sat ratings on the iPad are also off the charts. So I don't know if any of that is new, I doubt that it is. But I think we're in a very good position.\nOperator: We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.\nMark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Peter, I want to see if you can give us a little more insight on the iPad gross margins going forward. Just given Tim's comments earlier about the bounty of underachievers out there, at least, nearly going, should we assume then that Apple can really improve the future set with the next generation and kind of hold pricing stable?\nPeter Oppenheimer: I'm sorry, Mark, that's not a question I can answer. We don't talk about future products. But I can tell you that in terms of what we're shipping today, we're always aggressively working to lower our costs. And I think we have a good track record in doing so, and our gross margins were stronger than we thought for the December quarter. And I've provided guidance for the March quarter at 38.5%. And we feel very, very good about the performance of our products and our cost of products.\nMark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co: And then my follow-up, Tim, I apologize if this question has been asked, I fell off for a moment, I want to come back to the MacBook Air. Just given the initial success here and momentum, can you give us any sort of insight in terms of how you're looking at that platform now? Is it kind of a premium tablet? Is this kind of more of a notebook still? I trying to get a sense of just kind of a one-two punch in terms of the iPad, with the MacBook Air, kind of giving you a kind of a double coverage, if you will, in both notebooks and tablets?\nTimothy Cook: The way that we look at it is it's the Mac of the future shipping today, and it was a phenomenal part of our growth on the Mac last quarter. It has gotten off to a unbelievable start. The customers love it. They love the precision of it, they love the thinness, the weight, the instant on and the list is long, I think. And so we're really happy with how it's doing out of the starting blocks. And as you know, we've only been shipping it for less than 90 days, and so we've just gotten going.\nOperator: We'll go to Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.\nJason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: There's been a lot of talk about this consumerization of enterprise technology, and obviously, it's being driven by folks bringing their iPhones and iPads to work. I know you said it's some big share gains within your statistics. But I was curious if you think there still are some barriers around maybe developer training at the corporate level or security or things that just sort of naturally need to get worked through before you start to see those penetration numbers even increase further or start to see a wider swathe of employees use iPhones and iPads in business?\nTimothy Cook: I think that the consumerization that you speak of, of the enterprise, is one of the megatrends that are occurring. I think the most forward-looking CIOs are coming to the realization that the productivity of the person, the creativity of the employees is materially more important than everyone using the same thing. And the ability to write apps in a simple and straightforward manner for the iPhone or the iPad through the SDK is an incredible thing. And you can wind up, literally, running your whole business off of an iPad or an iPhone. And so I think the list of ideas and places that people can go there are -- were unimaginable just a few months ago. And so I see an enormous potential there. The numbers are already incredible. And think about this, the iPad started shipping in April, and we're already up to 80% of the largest companies deploying or piloting the product. This is unheard of, at least, in my dealings with the enterprise over the years. Generally, enterprise is much slower and much more cautious and uses things that have been in the market for a long time. And I think to everyone's credit, they've seen the value of this from a productivity and creativity point of view, and they're really moving fast. And so I think we're just scratching the surface right now. In terms of inhibitors, the iPad has a huge advantage because as you probably remember, as we went to various different iOS releases, we always put in a huge chunk of enterprise features. And so this isn't something that we just started focusing on. We started focusing on this before we shipped the first phone. And with the synergy that exists with the iOS between the different products, other products get the advantage of it, not just the product that it ships on initially. And so I think there's a huge play here for us.\nNancy Paxton: A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks, as a podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

And I'd now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. Thank you for joining us. We're pleased to report the results of our fourth fiscal quarter. We established a new September quarter records for iPhone, iPad and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest September quarter revenue and earnings ever. Revenue for the quarter was $36 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. That's a $7.7 billion increase over the prior September quarter\u2019s results and was driven primarily by strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales. Operating margin was $10.9 billion, representing 30.4% of revenue. Net income was $8.2 billion, increasing 24% over the prior September quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $8.67. Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold over 4.9 million Macs establishing a new September quarter record. This represents 1% growth year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published estimate of 8% contraction of the global personal computer market in the September quarter. Portable sales grew 9% year-over-year and represented an all time high of 80% of Mac unit mix, thanks to strong sales of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. Earlier this week we unveiled the stunning new design for iMac that packed high performance technology and a brilliant new display with reduced reflection into an incredibly sleek aluminum and glass enclosure. We also introduced an even thinner and lighter version of our most popular Mac, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, featuring a retina display with over 4 million pixels in all flash storage. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory which is below our target range of four to five weeks. Moving to our music products, we sold 5.3 million iPods compared to 6.6 million in the year ago quarter. iPod touch continue to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the September quarter based on the latest data published by MPD and iPod continue to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We\u2019re very excited to be shipping our newest iPods as of two weeks ago. The new iPod touch is the thinnest iPod touch yet, comes in five great colors and features of 4-inch Retina display, a 5 megapixel iSight camera, our powerful A5 chip and Siri. The new iPod Nano is the thinnest iPod ever featuring a 2.5-inch Multi-Touch display, convenient navigation buttons, and built-in Bluetooth for wireless listening. The Nano comes in seven great new colors and we think our full range of iPods will make wonderful gifts this holiday season. The iTunes Store generated all time record results, with revenue almost $2.1 billion thanks to continued strong sales of music, apps and video. We look forward to launching the new iTunes featuring the completely redesigned player, seamless integration with iCloud and a new look for the iTunes Store. The new iTunes has a dramatically simpler and clearner interface, so customers\u2019 music, movie and TV purchases on any of their iOS devices or computers are conveniently displayed in their iTunes library and are available whenever they want them. I\u2019d now like to turn to iPhone. we\u2019re very pleased to have sold 26.9 million iPhones compared to 17.1 million in the previous September quarter. That represents 58% year-over-year growth compared to IDC\u2019s latest published estimate of 45% growth for the smartphone market overall during the quarter. We launched iPhone 5 in nine countries on September 21 and 22 more countries on September 28, and demand has been phenomenal. Customers have responded tremendously to the iPhone 5 all-new slim and light design and beautiful new 4-inch Retina display, the powerful performance of the A6 chip and the great new ultrafast wireless technology. Demand for iPhone 5 continues to outstrip supply, and we are working very hard to get more into customer\u2019s hands as quickly as possible. We ended the quarter with about $9.1 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 800,000 iPhones and ended the quarter below our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look-forward basis. Recognized revenue from iPhone handsets and accessories sales was $17.1 billion during the quarter compared to $11 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 56%. Businesses around the world continue to make iPhone, an essential device for their employees. Virtually, every type of enterprise in the small business is using iPhone along with the business apps from the app store and custom apps developed in-house to drive efficiencies that were simply not possible before. Canon has provided its field sales team iPhones with secure access to its customer relationship management system, sales reps can now access customer information and input meeting notes anywhere giving them more time with customers. Amtrak has deployed thousands of iPhones to train conductors, the use an in-house app that changes the entire ticketing and reporting workflow. The app enabled print-at-home ticket validation delivers a more accurate passenger manifest and makes the accounting data available to Amtrak\u2019s revenue systems in near real time, revolutionizing the paper-based process, the company used in the past. And news organizations around the world are using iPhone to transform the way they capture and deliver news. reporters for BBC, the Wall Street Journal, Mexican newspaper, Milenio and Canada\u2019s CTV News are using their iPhone cameras to capture HD video on location and send it directly back to headquarters for broadcast on TV or streaming on the web. Turning to iPad, we were very pleased with sales of 14 million iPads during the September quarter compared to 11.1 million in the year ago quarter and the increase of 26%. iPad sales were ahead of our expectations and we saw a strong year-over-year growth in iPad sales in every geographic region. Earlier this week, we introduced the iPad Mini, the thinnest, lightest, smallest iPad we\u2019ve ever build. it has all the power, performance and capability, customers have come to expect from an iPad and you can hold it in one hand. We also introduced the fourth generation iPad with the beautiful 9.7-inch Retina display, an A6 chip with twice the performance of the iPad we announced earlier this year. Together with the iPad 2, these two new iPads run more than 275,000 apps in the App Store. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was 7.5 billion compared to 6.9 billion in the year-ago quarter and the increase of 9%. we ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 200,000, which left as just over our four weeks of iPad channel inventories, target on a look-back basis. iPad is fundamentally changing work processes across industries around the world. With apps developed in-house, iPad is helping companies deliver better service; streamline manufacturing and then power workforces with critical data and information. Volkswagen has developed more than 30 in-house apps for vital processes across the company including monitoring and tracking of vehicles on the production line, scheduling the vehicle transportation at assembly plants and greeting customers when they pick up new cars. Ping An Insurance in China has deployed thousands of iPads to their sales agents and service teams. Apps developed in-house are used by car accident inspectors to carry out onsite inspections involve claims, which significantly shortens processing time and improves customer satisfaction. In Brazil, Banco Bradesco is using iPads to redefine the customer experience in their bank branches. Beyond completing customer transaction, employees use iPad to inform and educate customers about bank services, and Bradesco apps in the App Store. Combining iPhones, iPads and iPod touch, we sold over 44 million iOS devices in the September quarter. The App Store now offers more than 700,000 apps, including over 275,000 apps specifically for iPad. We established a new all-time record for quarterly app sales in the September quarter, and we were very pleased to report that we have reached $6.5 billion in cumulative payments to developers. Customers are embracing iPad in growing numbers. With over 190 million account sign ups in the first year of the service. With iCloud, customers can access their music, photos, calendars, contacts, documents and more from whatever device they are using. And it is built into every new iOS device and every new Mac. And we launched iOS6 last month, and it\u2019s already on over 200 million devices. iOS 6 includes over 200 new features, including broader language support for Siri, Facebook integration, shared photo streams and more. We\u2019ve made a number of improvements in maps over the past month, and we will work non-stop until maps lives up to our incredibly high standards. I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue was $4.2 billion, which is a new September quarter record and an increase of 18% over the year-ago quarter, with growth yield primarily by the store\u2019s best iPhone launch ever. The stores also established a new quarterly record for Mac sales, selling just over 1.1 million Macs. We opened a total of 18 new stores in 10 countries during the quarter, including our first store in Sweden. We also opened our second store at Hong Kong, at Festival Walk overwhelming response, resulting in our biggest store opening of the year. We exited the quarter with 390 stores, 140 of which are outside the United States. With an average of 376 stores open, average revenue per store was $11.2 million, compared to $10.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Segment margin was $848 million, compared to $652 million in the year-ago quarter. We hosted 94 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 77.5 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 22%. That translates to an average of 19,000 visitors per store, per week. Total company gross margin was 40%, which was 150 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was due to better than expected, commodity and other costs. Another quarterly difference was due to leverage on the higher-than-expected sales and more favorable foreign exchange. The remainder was due to some items that we do not expect to recur in the December quarter. Operating expenses were $3.5 billion, and included $379 million of stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was a net expense to $51 million. The interest income and investment gains were more than offset by higher-than-expected currency hedging expense. Under the accounting rules, foreign exchange fluctuations late in the quarter required us to accelerate recognition of premium expense related to Q1 and Q2 hedges. This will result in less premium expense being recognized in Q1 and Q2 the tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%, bringing us to a tax rate for the full fiscal year of 25.2%. Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $121.3 billion at the end of the September quarter, compared to $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of over $4 billion. The increase in cash was net of $2.5 billion of dividend paid in August. About $83 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the September quarter. Cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion. Our board of directors have declared a dividend of $2.65 per common share, payable on November 15, 2012. The shareholders of recorded as of the close of business on November 12, 2012. In August, we entered into a rule 10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase program, with the financial institution to purchase out the $2 billion of Apple stock during fiscal year \u201913. In addition to shares purchased through the accelerated share repurchase program, we may also purchase shares in open market transaction in compliance with our applicable securities laws. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. As a reminder, year-over-year comparison will be impacted by the fact that our December quarter this year will span 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter last year included a 14th week. As we indicated previously, revenue in that 14th week last year was approximately one 14th of the quarter\u2019s total revenue. We expect revenues to be about $52 billion compared to $46.3 billion in the December quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 36% reflecting approximately $90 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $4.05 billion including about $485 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $380 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. We are targeting EPS of about $11.75. In closing, we\u2019re extremely proud to conclude an amazing fiscal year 2012. We generated revenue of over $156 billion, which is up 45% year-over-year, and reflects growth of $48 billion in revenue. We sold over $200 million iOS devices including 125 million iPhones reflecting 73% growth year-over-year, and 58 million iPads reflecting 80% growth. We sold a record $18 million Macs and shipped 35 million iPods. And we expanded the reach of iTunes music stores to 63 countries around the world. We launched stunning new versions of OS X and iOS, and time it altogether; we launched iPod with customers reaching over 190 million and growing. And finally, we generated net income of $41.7 billion, an increase of 61% year-over-year. We enter this holiday season with our strongest product lineup ever and remain very confident in our new product pipeline. With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. If your guidance comes to fruition, December will be the first quarter in a very long time, but Apple EPS declined year-on-year despite what has been the broadest product refresh in the company\u2019s history over the past two months, the [bares] will point out that may be the company\u2019s price premium or supply kind of advantage is weakening, so just curious how you would respond to that? And then as a follow-up, Peter if you can comment on what\u2019s driving the significant gross margin down-tick in December given you should have decent iPhone mix? Thank you.\nPeter Oppenheimer:  Sure. Katy, let me begin, I\u2019ll address many of the things you asked, and then Tim can add a few points. The change year-over-year is being driven by a couple of things, so first of all, last year included a 14th week, this year\u2019s Q1 is a normal 13-week quarter. That along with a stronger U.S. dollar, and the change in gross margin, so let me talk to you about what we see for gross margin, but I\u2019m going to go through some detail on a sequential basis, but not year-over-year. As you pointed out, this is the most prolific product period in Apple\u2019s history. We have an unprecedented number of new product introductions over the last six weeks, and this has led to record levels of demand. New or re-priced versions of our products announced during this time frame represent over 80% of the total expected December quarter revenue. But there are costs associated with such dramatic change and demand. The iPhone 5, iPad Mini, iMac, MacBook Pro 13-inch, iPod Touch and iPod Nano have completely new form factors with great new features, and we\u2019ve never before introduced so many new form factors at once. All of these products have higher costs than their predecessors, and therefore lower gross margins as they are at the height of the cost curve. This has been the case with new products in the past, so nothing new. The difference this time is the sheer number of new products we are introducing in a very short period of time. Additionally, we lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and iPhone 4, delivering incredible value to our customer. We head into this holiday quarter with the strongest iPhone line-up that we have ever had with the iPhone 4 starting at three in the subsidized markets. We also added the iPad Mini to our iPad line-up. The iPad Mini has the full iPad experience, and we priced it aggressively at $329, delivering incredible value to our customers. Its gross margin is significantly below the corporate average. So in summary, we expect our gross margin to decline by about 400 basis points sequentially. We expect the benefit from positive leverage on a sequentially higher revenue and a greater mix of iPhone, but we expect these benefits will be more than offset by a number of factors. First, margins on new products are lower than their predecessors including the iPhone 5 and we have been aggressive with the iPad Mini. Second, we\u2019ve lowered the price of the iPhone 4S and the iPhone 4. Third, we will experience transitionary cost associated with multiple new product ramp. Fourth, the high anticipated volume of iPhone and other new products will generate significantly greater deferred revenue sequentially. As you are aware, we defer a portion of our revenue with every device we sell, and amortize it back into revenue over the life of the device. In periods of exceptionally strong sales like the December quarter, the deferred amounts are significantly higher than the revenue amortized in from past sales. And fifth, the favorable items that benefited the gross margin in the September quarter are not expected to repeat in the December quarter. We will work hard to try and get down the cost curves and improve our manufacturing and other efficiencies as we successfully have done in the past. We ended this holiday season with our strongest product line-up ever, and we have great choices for customers. To be in a position to anticipate over $50 billion of demand for our products in a single quarter is a reflection of the incredible strength of our products and our business.\nTimothy D. Cook:  And Katy, if I could just add a couple of things to that. We are dedicated to making the very best products in the world, and we think about the smallest of details, and we are unwilling to cut corners in delivering the best customer experience to the world. It\u2019s this relentless commitment to innovation and excellence is the reason that our customers choose buy our products, and this will always be the driving force behind Apple. We are managing the company for the long-run and will continue to make great long-term decision. We remain very, very confident in our strategy, and will use our world-class skills and hardware, software and services to delight our customers.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC : Thanks for the details.\nNancy Paxton:  Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we\u2019ll go to Bill Shope.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Okay, great. Thanks. Can you walk through how you\u2019re thinking about the supply ramp for the iPhone 5 in the holiday quarter? And how does some of the challenges you\u2019re facing relative to the strong demand compared to the past iOS product launches?\nTimothy D. Cook: Hi Bill, it\u2019s Tim. The demand for iPhone is extremely robust, we are thrilled with what we see; we are in a significant state of backlog right now. In terms of the production, our output has improved significantly since earlier this month. And I\u2019m very, very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made there; I\u2019m pleased with the current level of output in what is the largest volume ramp in Apple\u2019s history. It\u2019s difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance, but I\u2019m feeling very confident on our ability to supply quite a few iPhones.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.:  Great, thank you.\nNancy Paxton:  Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC:  Yes, thank you. I just wanted to first follow-up on that previous question around the ramp of iPhone. Do you continue to anticipate rolling out to all 100 countries this quarter as you had announced at the time of the iPhone 5 announcement. And related to that can you comment on whether the supply constraints that you\u2019ve had, have had a material impact on your cost of goods sold relative. So as your supply improves, do you actually expect your cost of goods sold to decline? \nTimothy D. Cook:  Tony, it\u2019s Tim. In regard to your first question, we still continue to anticipate rolling out to the 100 countries as we announced before, it is our fastest rollout ever; there will be some large countries in month of December. But we anticipate still achieving the 100. In terms of costs, with each new product we see learning curves associated with ramping production. And the new products we have now are no exception to that, the difference is the number of new products that we having moving in line. As Peter said, and as you can talk, the announcements we\u2019ve had the last couple of months, this is the most prolific period in our history in terms of the new product introduction and innovation; the past six weeks have been phenomenal in terms of new product introduction. And so we do see all of these costs associated with each of these. But I don\u2019t see those costs accelerating on a per unit basis. As we got through the quarter, I see it very much being a production ramp across many, many new products.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC:  Okay, thank you for that color. If I could just follow-up, you\u2019ve talked before about how you believe that the iPad will be, and the tablet market will be an enormous market, bigger than the PC market. Clearly, you\u2019ve made a move to expand that market and make it more accessible by introducing the iPad Mini. I\u2019m wondering if over time you could see this market evolving to larger tablets going forward that would address different needs in the marketplace, take on incremental PC functionality, and I\u2019m wondering when you talk about the iPad market being bigger than the PC market going forward, do you see larger form factors in the marketplace evolving, and I guess the question, is why not?\nTimothy D. Cook:  Tony, as you know we don\u2019t comment on our future views on products and roadmaps etcetera. But let me make some comments on your question. We continue to be very confident that the tablet market will surpass the PC market, there is incredible development in both ecosystems and product going on in the tablet space. It is already extremely compelling for many, many customers to choose the tablet, in particular an iPad over a PC. And when you look at the size of the PC market, there is an enormous opportunity for Apple there. Pretty much each quarter you see 80 to 90 million PCs being sold. And so we do think that the iPad and the iPad Mini, and the iPad 2 will all be extremely attractive offering for people in lieu of PC. And we are going to continue to very much focus on the future of iPad, and we are very, very confident with what we have in the pipeline. And we are extremely pleased to have launched iPad Mini; and can\u2019t wait until next Friday, when we begin selling the very first unit.\nNancy Paxton:  Thanks, Tony.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC:  Thank you.\nNancy Paxton:  Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator:  From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.\nShannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC:  Thank you very much. Tim or Peter could you talk a little bit about China, and what you\u2019re seeing in China fairly with your revenue guidance, it sounds like it remained strong, but obviously there\u2019s been some mixed signal from an economic standpoint?\nTimothy D. Cook:  Yeah Shannon, it\u2019s Tim. In terms of what we saw in China for Q4, revenue was $5.7 billion, that\u2019s up 26% year-on-year, Mac was up extremely strong, up 44%. As you recall, we launched portables for the first time in July or the portables that we have previously announced in U.S. in June, we announced that in China in July. iPad was up 45% in Greater China, iPhone was up 38%. And so all in all, a fantastic quarter that brings us to a full year fiscal year revenue number of $23.8 billion for China which is really phenomenal, when you think about it, that\u2019s up over $10 billion year-on-year up 78% and Greater China now represents about 15% of Apple for the fiscal year and so we\u2019re extremely happy with how we\u2019ve done in China as Peter alluded to in his opening remarks, we are continuing to invest in our own retail stores there, we continue to expand distribution in with channel partners as well, and we continue to see it as a extremely exciting market with more and more people wanting Apple product.\nShannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC: Great, and then I just had a follow-up question on the Tablet market, with the launch of Surface today and obviously the Win 8 Tablet of Mac, could you talk a little bit about what are you seeing, from a competitive standpoint and how you think about it? Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook:  Yeah, I haven\u2019t personally played with the Surface yet, but what we\u2019re reading about it is that it\u2019s a fairly compromised confusing product, and so I think one of the toughest things you do with deciding which product is to make hard trade off and decide what a product should be and we\u2019ve really done that with the iPad, and so the user experience is absolutely incredible, I suppose you could design a car that flies and floats, but I don\u2019t think it would do all of those things very well, and so I think people when they look at the iPad versus competitive offerings are going to conclude, they really want an iPad and I think people have done that to-date and I think they will continue to do that.\nShannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton:  Thanks, Shannon, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Barclays, we\u2019ll go to Ben Reitzes.\nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Thanks a lot, appreciate it. Can you just go through a little bit more on tablets, the iPad Mini, how do you think that will sell versus the original iPad form factor and how do you want to differentiate that is there more of an eBook focus with and education focus with the Mini and do you think it will sell more than the regular or the original iPad and how do you want us to just think about the cannibalization factor as well of the older product or the older form factor?\nTimothy D. Cook:  We don\u2019t really have an old product, then we have only new product, we just announced the fourth generation iPad as well and\u2026\nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Yeah, I knew, I do, I\u2019d messed up in my speech there sorry.\nTimothy D. Cook:  So, no, but the way that we look at this is that we provide a fantastic iPad Touch, we provide an incredible fourth generation iPad and iPad Mini and then iPad 2. Customers will decide which one or two or three or all four that they would like and will buy those and so we\u2019ve learned over the years not to worry about cannibalization of our own products, it\u2019s much better for us to do that than somebody else to do it and the far, far bigger opportunity here are the 80 million to 90 million PCs that are being sold per quarter, there\u2019s still over 300 million PCs being bought per year, and I think a great number of those people would be much better of buy an iPad or a Mac, and so that\u2019s a much bigger opportunity for Apple, and so instead of being focused on cannibalizing ourselves, and I look at it in much more that it\u2019s an enormous incremental opportunity for us and so that\u2019s how I look at it.\nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Okay, and then just my quick follow-up is on Apple TV we haven\u2019t heard about your hobby in [Vaio] how many did you sell in the quarter and what\u2019s the strategy there for the living room to-date and I\u2019m intrigued to hear the answer or not an answer?\nTimothy D. Cook:  Or not you might guess, for Q4 we sold 1.3 million that is up over a 100% year-on-year that means that we sold up more than 5 million Apple TVs during the fiscal year, which is almost double the previous year, we have sold 2.8 the previous year and so the business continues to do very well, but if you look at the size of revenue of this business versus our other businesses, it\u2019s quite small and so it still has the (inaudible) label, however it\u2019s below Toby and we continue to focus on it and continue to believe there is something more there and continue to pull the string to see where it takes us.\nBenjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital: Thanks a lot, Tim.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Moving on we\u2019ll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nCharles Eugene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Hey good afternoon. Tim, can you talk a little bit about the iPad we saw a deceleration in September quarter. Was there anything in particular that might have been, as do you think about that business might have been driving that?\nTimothy D. Cook: The June to September was 17 million to 14 million Gene and the first thing to know there is that as we had talked about in the July call, the June quarter contained 1.2 million increase in channel inventory and so the actual sell through sequentially looks, the comparison looks very different than the our reported sell in numbers do, the second thing is that the $14 million exceeded what we had expected to do in iPad and the reason we had expected it to decline is that we believe based on the two or three years of results that we\u2019ve got is that normally, we would see a seasonal reduction in the September quarter versus the June quarter, a part of this reason is because K-12 heavily buys in the June quarter, K-12 doesn\u2019t buy very much in the September quarter, it becomes the Higher Ed kind of move and Higher Ed is still buying notebooks for the most part, and so there is some kind of normal seasonal that\u2019s exaggerated further when we announced the new product in March and have an enormous full quarter of demand in the June quarter and then when you compare that to the September quarter there would be natural phase down. In addition to all of that, people it\u2019s clear that customers delayed purchases of tablets due to new product rumors and this intensified in August and September. Some of that was anticipated and some of it I wish wouldn\u2019t occur. But it did occur. And so that\u2019s how we would explain the sequential difference. On a year-over-year basis because of the year ago quarter having also a channel inventory build as we stock the channel to the profit level the sell through year-over-year actually grew 44% and so the underlying sell through was extremely strong. And so we continue to feel great about how iPad has done and with announcing the fourth generation iPads just as we and adding iPad Mini to the family, we think it\u2019s going to be an incredible holiday season.\nCharles Eugene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Okay, great, thank you, and then my follow-up question is given what we\u2019re seeing in margins that some of these products get more expensive to produce to be competitive, would you be open to passing some of those cost on to customers and obviously historically you\u2019ve announced new products and maintain a lot of those price points?\nTimothy D. Cook: It\u2019s a hypothetical question, hence so we think, we\u2019ve made great choices on the product and the prices and as you know our customary practice, long-standing customary practice is just to guide for the current quarter, and so I would want to talk about what we might do post that.\nCharles Eugene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Great, thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: Thanks, Gene.\nNancy Paxton:  Thank you, Gene. We have the next question please?\nOperator: From JPMorgan, we\u2019ll go to Mark Moskowitz.\nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, thank you, good afternoon. Peter or Tim my first question is around the sequential guidance for revenue of around 44% quarter-on-quarter for December. Can you provide us some context about how we should think about the iPad and the iPhone families in particular? How their revenue growth could [down tail] of that 44%?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Hi, Mark. It\u2019s Peter. You\u2019re asking the sequential question, but I do want just to remind everybody that if you are looking at this year-over-year and comparing the sequential year-over-year, don\u2019t forget about the 14th week, last year in Q1, you need to adjust for that. And I think it would give you a different answer, if you were comparing anything year-over-year. Specifically, your question about iPhone and iPad sequentially, we have just announced amazing new products in both lineups and we expect large sequential increases, going from the September to December quarter. And as a result, what\u2019s real to be providing guidance tonight for $52 billion of revenue.\nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC:\n :\nTimothy D. Cook: What we did initially Mark, as we planned the first 30 to 40 countries prior to introducing the product and roll those out across at September in two different dates. The balance of the quarter, we planned with an eye toward the supply and what we think the demand will be. But we do plan these in advance and so it is not a pr\u00e9cised science. And we obviously have to plan those with several weeks of notice. And so occasionally, it can be different than what we think.\nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Mark. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.\nSteven M Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC:  Thank you very much. Regarding the iPad, you said that you priced it very aggressively. I think many people on The Street seem to have a slightly different view. Could you maybe talk a little about your pricing philosophy? And was it driven by cost? Or is it just more to keep up a premium brand, given the quality of your products?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Steve, it\u2019s Peter. When we set out the bill, the iPad Mini, we didn\u2019t set out the bill to small cheap tablet, we set out the bill to smaller iPad that offers the full iPad experience as our customers would expect. As a result, the difference between the iPad Mini and the competition is profound, our iPad Mini begins with a 7.9 inch display, which is 35% larger than 7 inch tablets, providing a much better experience. We\u2019re shipping two great cameras: FaceTime HD front and a 5 megapixel of 1080p iSight rear camera versus typically a one from our competition. We are shipping our fastest communications with dual-band Wi-Fi and have included the A5 chip, which has higher performance than our competitors. And finally, the fit and finish of our precision, unibody aluminum closure is breathtaking when held in your hands. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. The iPad Mini has higher costs and the gross margin is significantly below our cooperate average, we\u2019re beginning the higher cost curve, but in addition to wanting to make a large number, we\u2019re going to work to try and get down the cost curves and be more efficient in manufacturing as we have been in the past with our other products.\nTimothy D. Cook: Steve, one of the things we try to do is to create a product that people will love for months and years after they purchase it and continue using it in a robust way. So that\u2019s what iPad Mini has been designed to do. And you can really see that more broadly on iPad by looking at the usage statistics, as I had mentioned earlier this week, over 90% of the web traffic from tablets are from iPad. And so, Apple will not make a product that somebody may feel good about it for the moment that they\u2019re paying for it and then when they get it home, they really ever use AVR, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re about, it\u2019s not a kind of experience we want our customers to have. And I think when you \u2013 I would encourage you to use an iPad Mini and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be using anything other than maybe another iPad or something after you do that.\nSteven M Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC: I look forward to it. could you comment on your enterprise opportunity or obviously a lot of its BYOD, but you have many retailers, you have a corporate director to use iPads and so forth. are you doing anything a little bit more aggressive to support that market particularly with the Windows pads now coming out?\nTimothy D. Cook: We now have almost all of the Fortune 500 that are testing or deploying iPad and I think with the recent announcements, the penetration will only grow. We\u2019ve also pushed fairly aggressively in the Global 500. And so those numbers now are above 80% on both iPhone and iPad. And so I feel like we are doing fairly well there, there is clearly much more to do. But I\u2019m feeling pretty good about it.\nSteven M Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we\u2019ll hear from Scott Craig.\nScott D. Craig \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Hey, thanks, good afternoon. Tim, maybe comment on the component environment a little bit particularly, related to the iPad, iPad Mini and iPhone and just where you see some of the constraints perhaps here as you\u2019re launching. And then Peter, the quick one for you, the volatility on the OI&E line. is that just the calendar third quarter and calendar fourth quarter issue, and then it normalizes or is that going to continue? Thanks.\nTimothy D. Cook: Scott, it\u2019s Tim. In terms of iPad and iPhone, I don\u2019t see a component shortage getting us for the quarter in the numbers that we\u2019ve given you in the guidance. I think we saw some challenges there and feel good about our position. In terms of general shortages on the iMac, we\u2019ll be constrained for the full quarter in a significant way, part of that is that we\u2019re beginning shipping the 21.5-inch iMac in November and the 27-inch in December. And so there will be a short amount of time during the quarter to manufacturer and ramp those and I expect the demand to be robust. So we will have a significant shortage there. the others are more based on how big is big from a demand point of view and that is very difficult to predict, but you can tell that we\u2019re extremely bullish on the demand with the revenue guidance that Peter talked about earlier. Hopefully that answers your question.\nScott D. Craig \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thanks.\nGary Wipfler: Hey, Scott. This is Gary. I\u2019ll take the OI&E question. Okay, I\u2019ll expand on Peter\u2019s remarks just a little bit while interest income was above what we expected, foreign exchange hedging expense was higher than we expected relative to our guidance. without getting overly detailed, dollar weakness late in the quarter and accounting rules required us to accelerate and recognize a large amount of foreign exchange premium expense related to future quarter hedges in the current quarter. All things being equal, premium expense in Q1 should be lower. This has been factored into our December OI&E guidance of $380 million.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Gary and thanks, Scott. Could we have the next question, please? \nOperator: From ISI Group, we\u2019ll hear from Brian Marshall.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group: Great, thanks guys. If you look at the iPhone, unit growth versus the revenue growth, that\u2019s been a pretty similar dynamic over the past several quarters, but when you look at that same dynamic for the iPad, it\u2019s actually started to breakdown slightly over the past couple of quarters in fact, this most recent quarter, it looks like revenues grew three times faster than the unit growth. So I guess the question is, is this just simply the market migrating down to the sort of low-end of this skew stack or just less accessories from an attached or dollar spent in that and a quick follow up.\nPeter Oppenheimer:  Brian it\u2019s Peter. I didn't quite follow your three times, but the iPhone ASPs were relatively flat in the September quarter, year-on-year and were up slightly on a sequential basis. The iPad ASPs were down year-over-year in a low double-digit way, but this really was reflective of our price reduction on the iPad 2 the stronger dollar and a little bit of change in mix and that's what drove the ASP change year-over-year on a sequential basis. iPad ASPs were actually pretty flat.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group: Great thanks, and then a quick follow-up is, looks like this is the second quarter in a row that the United States iPhone activations is actually growing faster than the international market that kind of seems like a strange dynamic considering the magnitude of the turn of the international being order magnitude larger than the U.S., one of you could comment on that, thanks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: I think it's important to remember there that we launched iPhone 5 in the U.S. during the quarter and where we launched in some international countries the bulk of the world we did not launch it yet and so I would have expected to have seen a more significant growth in the U.S. versus the rest of the world.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Brian, could we have the next question please.\nOperator: From Bank of Montreal, we\u2019ll go to Keith Bachman.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Hi thank you. A clarification question, will the iPhone 5 launch in Mainland China occur in the December quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: Keith, it's Tim. Yes we project that it will occur in December.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Okay thanks and the clarification on top of that, did you comment that you think you'll be able to meet supply of iPhone's at the end of the December quarter or do you think that you will end the quarter with backlogs of iPhone 5, or iPhones I should just say it's as a product's category?\nTimothy D. Cook: I'm actually not projecting whether supply and demand will balance for the quarter, I'm saying that I feel great about where we are on the manufacturing ramp that our supply output is significantly higher than it was earlier in October, and I'm confident that we'll be able to supply quite a few during the quarter, but in terms of where that, when that balance occurs, I can't tell at this point.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Okay\nTimothy D. Cook: Demand is very robust.\nKeith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets: Okay, thanks very much.\nNancy Paxton:\n :\nOperator: From Deutsche Bank, we\u2019ll go to Chris Whitmore.\nChris K. Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: Thanks very much. Tim I wanted to go back to the iPad one more time if I could, specifically I wanted to ask or try to give us a feel for your view around the emerging model in the tablets base where vendors are willing to subsidize their hardware with content or search, where many of these vendors are selling hardware that break-even or even a loss and hoping they make it up on the back end, how is that impacting your iPad business if at all and is that something Apple would consider going forward?\nTimothy D. Cook: We've seen low-cost challenges before and iPad continues to beat every other tablet on the market, it can be any price and so we think customers are very smart, we think they have very high expectations, we think that they want a device that can do more and we are confident that our focus on making the best product is what will win at the end of the day and so we will stay true to that.\nChris K. Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: Okay and then my second question I wanted to ask about the supply, it sounds like you've made a lot of changes to your supplier list as these new products are ramping perhaps due to strategic reasons and is that creating an added layer of complexity as you try to ramp these new products and to what extent is that contributing perhaps to the higher cost structure of these products?\nTimothy D. Cook: I'm not sure what you're trying to get out there, but I would not say that there has been a significant change in our supplier partners. There is always some change obviously, but I wouldn't describe any change as significant and there hasn't been a change that would have driven more cost, if that\u2019s your specific question.\nChris K. Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: I was specifically asking about LCD in your Samsung relationship?\nTimothy D. Cook: LCD, I wouldn\u2019t characterize any change there, it\u2019s having driven any cost. And Samsung, we continue to be a customer of Samsung and continue to have a commercial relationship.\nChris K. Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: Welcome.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Chris. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.\nKulbinder Garcha \u2013 Credit Suisse:\n :\n :\n :\n, :\n :\n, :\n :\nTimothy D.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple\u2019s CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he\u2019ll be joined by Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2011, the Form 10-Q for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2012 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. We\u2019re pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly record for iPad unit sales and new June quarter records for iPhone and Mac unit sales, leading to our highest June quarter revenue and earnings ever. Revenue for the quarter was $35 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 23%. The $6.5 billion increase over the prior June quarter\u2019s result was driven primarily by strong growth in iPad and iPhone sales. Operating margin was $11.6 billion, representing 33% of revenue. Net income was $8.8 billion, increasing 21% over the prior June quarter\u2019s results. The quarter\u2019s net income translated to diluted earnings per share of $9.32. Turning to the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to begin with our Mac products and services. We sold 4 million Macs establishing a new June quarter record. This represents 2% growth year-over-year, compared to IDCs latest published estimate of 1% contraction of the global personal computer market in the June quarter. Last month, we updated the entire MacBook lines with faster processors, graphics, memory, flash storage and USB 3.0 connectivity. We also introduced the all-new 15 inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display, all flash architecture and quad core processors and customer response has been excellent. While receiving tremendous momentum for the iPad in education, which I\u2019ll discuss later, we also experienced our best quarter ever for U.S. education institution Mac sales with Portables representing nearly three quarters of total Mac sales. Notable large education transaction closed during the June quarter, include Rutherford County, North Carolina, which has purchased 6,000 MacBook Airs to support its 21st Century Digital Learning Environment, and Pueblo Colorado School District 70 were all high school students and K-12 staff in the 22 School District will convert to MacBook Air. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is below our target range of four to five weeks. Tomorrow, we will release Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of OS X. Mountain Lion introduces more than 200 features including all-new messages app, notification center, system wide sharing, and Facebook integration. We built iCloud into the foundation of Mountain Lion, making it easier than ever for customers to keep content up-to-date across all their devices. Moving to our music products, we sold 6.8 million iPods compared to 7.5 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectation and iPod Touch continue to account for over half of all iPod sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remained at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by NPD and iPod continue to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. We ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes Store generated very strong results in the quarter with revenue of over 1.8 billion, thanks to continued strong sales of music, apps and other content. We are pleased to launch the iTunes Store in 12 countries including Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan last month. Customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download from iTunes. We\u2019re continuing to see great interest in iTunes U. Since rolling it out in January, there have been over 40 million downloads of the iTunes U app. Over 700 new K-12 schools and districts and over 125 colleges and universities have enrolled in the iTunes U program, while over 750 new courses have been published. I\u2019d now like to turn to iPhone. We sold 26 million iPhones compared to 20.3 million in the previous June quarter; that represents 28% year-over-year growth and was ahead of the amount we factored into our guidance following very strong sales in channel inventory build we achieved in the March quarter. We added several small regional carriers during the quarter and now have iPhone distribution through over 250 carriers in over 100 countries. We ended the quarter with about 8.3 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential decline of about 300,000 iPhones, and we remained within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $16.2 billion during the quarter compared to $13.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 22%. Enterprises across the globe continue to choose iPhone as the standard device for their employees. We estimate that the number of iPhones in the Fortune 500 has more than doubled in the past year. iPhone is helping businesses and employees to be more productive wherever they are. PepsiCo has deployed thousands of iPhones with an in-house app build specifically for their field merchandisers. This app has eliminated paper reports and provides real-time information to managers, sales teams and delivery drivers. German insurance provider ERGO has built an in-house app for iPhone that thousands of agents use to process insurance claims, which has significantly reduced paper work and improved processing time and customer satisfaction. Turning to iPad, we were thrilled with sales of over 17 million iPads during the June quarter compared to 9.2 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 84%. We saw very strong year-over-year growth in iPad sales around the world and are pleased to be selling iPad in 97 countries. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $9.2 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 52%. We ended the quarter with about 3.2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.2 million units, which left us just within our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory.   The iPad continues to be a great success in the U.S. education market, with sales setting a new quarterly record and nearly doubling year-over-year to just under 1 million iPads. While interest in the new iPad was high, sales of the reduced price iPad 2 in the K-12 market were particularly strong. And even though, as I mentioned earlier, we achieved all time record Mac sales to U.S. education institutions during the quarter. We sold more than twice as many iPads as Macs to U.S. education institutions. We are extremely pleased with these results. One great example of iPad adoption in education is the Mansfield Texas Independent School District, which has purchased 11,000 iPads. This fall, every Mansfield High School student and teacher will receive an iPad under the district\u2019s Power Up initiative. Some teachers will use a flipped classroom concept, putting their lessons and resources online where students can access them anytime with their iPads. As a result, students take responsibility for their own learning and teachers are able to increase their interactions and personalize content time. iPad continues its rapid adoption within the enterprise. We estimate that the number of iPads in the Fortune 500 has more than tripled in the past year. iPad has become an indispensable tool worldwide to help employees across industries do their jobs more effectively. British Airways has incorporated thousands of iPads across their business from customer support at check-in to cabin service directors replacing paper printout to details customer preferences and provide real-time updates. And homebuilder Dialogue House in Japan is actively building smart homes that will be controlled by iPads, and their sales reps are using iPads to show floor plans and upgrade options. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, we surpassed 410 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 45 million in the June quarter. With App Stores in 155 countries, the iOS ecosystem continues to grow. The App Store now offers more than 650,000 apps, including over 225,000 apps specifically for iPad. We\u2019re extremely pleased to report that we have surpassed $5.5 billion in payment to developers, and customers are loving iCloud. Since its launch in October, more than 150 million people are using iCloud services. In June, we previewed many of the exciting new features of iOS 6 at our Developers Conference, including our fabulous new maps app, new functionality and broader language support for Siri, direct Facebook integration, shared photo streams via iCloud and Passbook, the simplest way to get all your passes in one place. We believe iOS 6 will significantly enhance the experience of one in an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch, and we can\u2019t wait to get it into the hands of customers this fall. I\u2019d now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue was $4.1 billion, an increase of 17% over the year-ago quarter, with growth yield primarily by all-time record iPad sales and strong growth in iPhone sales. The store sold 791,000 Macs compared to 768,000 in the year-ago quarter. And almost half the Macs sold in our stores during the quarter were the customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened a total of nine new stores in the quarter and exited the quarter with 372 stores, including 123 stores outside the United States. With an average of 367 stores opened, average revenue per store was $11.1 million compared to $10.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Segment margin was $868 million compared to $802 million in the year-ago quarter. We welcomed 83 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, compared to 74 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 12%. That translates to an average of 17,000 visitors per store per week. Total company gross margin was 42.8%, which was 130 basis points higher than our guidance. We experienced upside from better than expected commodity, warranty and other costs. These factors were partially offset by a stronger mix of iPad sales, a higher mix of lower priced iPhones, and a stronger U.S. dollar relative to our expectations. Operating expenses were $3.4 billion and included $378 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $288 million and the tax rate was 25.6%. Turning to cash, our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $117.2 billion at the end of the June quarter compared to $110 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $7 billion, and about $81 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the June quarter. Cash flow from operations was $10.2 billion. Today, we\u2019re announcing that our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.55 per common share payable on August 16, 2012 to stockholders of record after the close of business on August 13, 2012. Going forward, subject to declaration by our Board, we expect to announce record and payment dates for future dividends concurrently with our quarterly earnings announcements. Also, as we previously announced, our Board has authorized a three-year $10 billion share repurchase program starting in our fiscal 2013, which begins on September 30, 2012. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion compared to $28.3 billion in the September quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 38.5%, reflecting approximately $70 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.5 billion, including about $390 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $175 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.50%. We are targeting EPS of about $7.65. In closing, we\u2019re pleased with our record June quarter results, including sales of over 17 million iPads. We established new June quarter records for unit sales of iPhone and Macs and posted our best quarter ever for U.S. education. We remain extremely confident in our strategy and the investments we are making in our business. We\u2019re very excited to be launching Mountain Lion tomorrow and iOS 6 in the fall and we have some more amazing new products in our pipeline that we look forward to discussing with you later. With that I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: We\u2019d like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Kathy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Yes, thank you. Peter, I want to better understand the gross margin guidance for September, given that it\u2019s been nearly two years since you\u2019ve operated at a sub-40% gross margin. I understand mix may go against you a little bit in the near-term, but it should be structurally higher than two years ago, you have NAND pricing moving in your favor, and the products that you\u2019re selling in the market are relatively mature, so manufacturing cost should be favorable. Can you just talk about the dynamics that are pushing gross margins down again in September? Then I\u2019ve a follow-up.\nPeter Oppenheimer: We expect the gross margin as I said to be about 38.5%, which is down about 430 basis points sequentially. We expect most of this decline to be primarily driven by a fall transition and to a much lesser extent, the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. The warranty benefit that we saw in the June quarter is not repeating and a full quarter of the Back to School promotion. So that\u2019s what we see doing it, Katy.\nKathryn Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay. And then as a follow-up Tim, you\u2019ve obviously seen spectacular growth in China over the last several years, but there are some macro concerns in the market and your Asia-Pacific growth rate did decelerate from over 100% to I think 25% this quarter. So, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in China as it relates to overall demand? Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, Katy. Hi, it\u2019s Tim. The growth in Asia-Pacific was 25% as you indicated, and the vast majority of the difference in our sequential growth rate was a result of Greater China, which represents about two-thirds of our revenue of that region. As we reported for Q2, our Greater China revenue was $7.9 billion; and in Q3, our revenue was $5.7 billion. Now the $5.7 billion is a 48% year-over-year increase and so, it still is growing at incredible rates. Virtually, all of the $2.2 billion sequential revenue decline, was due to iPhone sales in Greater China and about half of that $2.2 billion is attributable to changes in the channel inventory not the underlying sell through of the iPhone. As a reminder, in the previous quarter, in our fiscal Q2, we launched the iPhone 4S in China in January. We added China Telecom as the second carrier in March, and as we proceeded across the quarter, we increased the channel inventory to accommodate the sales and to reach our target inventory of four to six weeks. The remainder of the sequential revenue decline is mainly attributable to normal seasonality after the very successful iPhone 4S launch. We did not see an obvious impact in Q3 that we would associate with the economy in Mainland China. We look at the economic report as all of you do and see the press. But again, we did not see something that we would attribute to the economy in China. In terms of iPhones in general in Mainland China, we were incredibly pleased with our results. We were up over 100% year-over-year, and as you probably know, just last Friday, so in Q4, we launched our new iPad in China after we resolved the iPad trademark issue. And so our sales did not benefit from the new iPad in the June quarter in Mainland China. Also, our new portables that we announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference began to ship in Mainland China last week after we received routine regulatory approval, and once again, the June quarter sales did not benefit from these products. So, net, we remain really confident about our plans and are very excited about our opportunity in China, and are very much looking forward to incorporating more local services as you probably saw in the Worldwide Developers Conference announcement of iOS 6, which will be coming in the fall.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Kathy. Could we have the next question please.\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we will hear from Bill Shope.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great, thanks. Can you talk about your thoughts on the individual segment trends when looking at your guidance. I know last quarter you\u2019ve given us some thoughts on that. Could you walk through how we\u2019re thinking about it now coming off of the sequential declines this quarter particularly on the iPhone segment?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure, Bill, it\u2019s Peter. Let me start off and if Tim wants to add something, he can. I will first talk about the products and then a little bit about how we are thinking of revenue. For iPhone, we would expect to have a year-over-year increase in sales in the September quarter. For iPad, we would also expect to have a year-over-year increase, but we would point out that we increased channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units. And in the year ago quarter, we also increased the iPad inventory at that time by 1.5 million units. And for Mac, we would expect a sequential increase. As we think about revenue, we\u2019re providing revenue guidance that is up by 20% year-over-year. We\u2019ve included several things on our \u2013 thinking. The first, we are not expecting the economies in Europe or the natural resource based countries including Australia, Brazil and Canada to improve from what we saw in the June quarter. As Tim said, we saw no obvious evidence of the economy impacting our sales in China in the June quarter or in the U.S., but we are reading the same things that you all are about these economies. So we will have to see. Our weekly iPhone sales continue to be impacted by rumors and speculation regarding new products. We exited the June quarter in supply and demand balance and we were within our four to six week inventory target. We also don\u2019t expect to add any significant new country or carrier additions in the September quarter. Regarding iPad, as I said, we\u2019re able to increase our iPad channel inventory in the June quarter by 1.2 million units and we ended the June quarter just within our four to six week channel inventory target and we increased last year by 1.5 million units in the September quarter, which also put us in our four to six week inventory target. These increases in channel inventory will impact both the year-over-year and sequential compares for iPad. The current iPad lineup that we're selling includes the very successful $399 price point, which we did not have in the year-ago quarter. So this, along with mix in the line will impact the ASPs in the September quarter. And finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against most currencies around the world including the euro, Brazilian Real, the Chinese RMB, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso and Swiss Franc. We expect this to have an adverse impact to revenue in these countries in excess of $400 million sequentially net of our hedges. All that being said, we very much look forward to introducing iOS 6 in the fall and we remain very confident in our business and our new product pipeline.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And just to follow-up if I could on the sequential iPhone decline. you gave us a pretty good outline of what was going on in China, but can you walk us through some of the trends you saw for iPhone demand sequentially in the other international region?\nTimothy D. Cook:  Yeah, Bill, it\u2019s Tim. First of all, at a global level, I think it\u2019s important to understand as you compare our Q2 iPhone sales to Q3, there is a fairly large channel inventory difference that is embedded in that. As you recall, in January, we completed the iPhone 4S rollout in all the major countries, including China. It was our fastest iPhone rollout ever. We were also able to get the channel at a \u2013 within our target inventory range of four to six weeks by the end of March. And so what that did was, it increased sell in over sell through by 2.6 million units. In the quarter that we just finished, our sell in was less than sell through by 300,000 units. And so the net change in channel inventory across the quarter is about 3 million units. And so, I think it\u2019s important to understand that to look at the underlying sell through trends. In terms of what we see happening in the different geographies, the U.S. was very strong, running at 47%, Japan was strong at 45%. I\u2019ve already mentioned Greater China was up 66%, but Mainland China was over doubled as I said before, it\u2019s over 100% up. The geography that did not perform well was Europe. Europe was essentially flat, slightly positive year-on-year and that really hampered our total results. Within Europe, now I\u2019ll switch from iPhone to talking about more of the gross revenue level. We see a margin difference between the countries. The U.K. was relatively solid at 30% growth, but France and Greece and Italy were particularly poor, and Germany was also similarly a single-digit positive growth for the quarter. Eastern Europe was strong, materially stronger than Western Europe, but obviously the Western European countries drive the preponderance of the revenue in that segment. And so, we\u2019re certainly seeing a slow down in business in that area. Fortunately, the U.S. and China, although I realize it\u2019s getting a lot of crest, we\u2019re not seeing anything that we would classify as an obvious economic issue.\nBill Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs:  Okay, very helpful. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Ben Reitzes with Barclays.\nBen Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.:  Yeah, thanks a lot. My first question, I wanted to ask about the fall transition you mentioned, Peter, when you are talking about gross margin. Can you talk a little bit about that, what is the sequential impact on margins and revenue that you\u2019re baking in and then qualitatively how much would you get back in the December quarter or how much of it\u2019s short-term?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Okay. Ben, I don\u2019t want to frustrate you or others, but the fall transition that I spoke about is driving most of the decline that we see sequentially in gross margin. It\u2019s not something that we\u2019re going to talk about in any level of detail today and we could not be more confident in our new product pipeline.\nBen Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Just with regard to the iPhone in general, you mentioned there were speculation about new products and rumors, but do you have any quantification of how much that hurt sales in the quarter either from you or Tim, and how much that maybe channel inventory reduction you\u2019ll need to do in the next quarter maybe resulting from that type of speculation?\nTimothy D. Cook: Ben, I think there is a lot of speculation out there. It\u2019s difficult to sort out, but I\u2019m fairly convinced based on what I\u2019ve seen that there is an incredible anticipation out there for future products and as you would expect given what we\u2019ve been able to deliver in the past. And so I think it\u2019s a reasonable amount. In terms of channel inventory in the current quarter, we put our current thinking in the guidance that Peter provided to you.\nBen Alexander Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.:  Okay, thank you very much.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Ben. Could we have next question please.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about the Mac business, I mean it was up 2% year-over-year, clearly still outperforming the market, but can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing how much of the slower growth was from say the product transition versus weak economy and then any thoughts on cannibalization of Mac by the iPad?\nTimothy D. Cook: Shannon, it\u2019s Tim. It\u2019s clear the PC market is weak based on the latest IDC data, but frankly we believe the primary factor for our lower growth rate in the Mac area is the timing of our portable announcement within last quarter. As you know, we announced an entirely new portable line up that\u2019s been incredibly well received. That was done with three weeks or less than three weeks remaining in the quarter. The year ago compare we made the transition in the portable area in February and so we were selling our new line up for the entire Q3 period. And so, if you look at the data underneath that to further illustrate this, prior to the Developers Conference, our weekly Mac sales were running below the prior year. After the Developers Conference, the MacBook Pros and the MacBook Airs drove year-over-year increases in weekly sell through. And they were to the level that got us back to an overall positive territory for the quarter and our 25 consecutive quarter of growing faster than the market. The MacBook Pro with the Retina display was incredibly well received, we ended the quarter in backlog, and we still have not caught up with demand yet, but anticipate doing so next month. Also to further illustrate the portable point, for the month of June, the NPD data that just came out for the United States showed our portable share at 25.5% and a record 47% of revenue share in the month of June. And so, I would attribute a large amount to what has happened in terms of the timing of our portable announcement.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Okay, great. And then could you talk a little bit, Tim, about what your conversations are like with the carriers in terms of pricing, subsidies, there's been a lot of talk about that over the last few months. So just how are your discussions with the carriers going clearly into the product transition that\u2019s coming?\nTimothy D. Cook: Let me avoid talking about the product transition, but you\u2019re very smart to ask that. I don't want to get into specific topics about with different carriers, but generally I would just say that our role is to make the very best smartphone in the world and that has an incredible user experience far superior than anything else that customers want to use everyday. And I think at the end of the day, the carriers want to buy or want to provide their customers with \u2013 what their customers want to buy. And so the most important thing for Apple by far is to continue making the best products in the world and we are very deeply committed to doing this and we\u2019re maniacally focused on it. From the carrier\u2019s perspective, I think it\u2019s also important to remember that the total subsidy that they pay is fairly small relative to the monthly payments they collect over a 24-month contract period. And I think many would tell you, they certainly told to me, that iPhone has several advantages for them over other smartphones, the churn rates are much less, you see carriers now focusing on shared data plans and I think an iPhone customer is likely more \u2013 is more likely to have a Tablet or an iPad. And so I think they really value these customers quite a bit. Also, our engineering teams are very sensitive to working with carriers to find the most efficient way to deal with data. And we think that we are the most efficient smartphone on the market for smartphones that are in an app rich ecosystem. And so we are going to continue to focus \u2013 focusing on making the best product and I think that the carriers will be very motivated to make sure that they provide that to the customers.\nShannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research: Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook:  Yeah.\nNancy Paxton:\n?:\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. I have one for Peter and one for Tim, please. Peter, you talked about how you were above expectations relative to your guidance on iPhone, and you also mention you were above expectations on iPod, and you said you were thrilled iPad, yet your EPS I think came in 5% or 6% above your guidance. So perhaps you can help us illustrate where you were disappointed to relative to your original guidance, because I think the commentary would certainly point to a much larger beat?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Toni, look, given what\u2019s going on around us, we are happy with our quarter. Sales of each of our products did exceed what we had factored into the guidance. That was especially true of the iPad, which set a new record at 17 million units, and the $35 billion of revenue that we reported grew by $6.5 billion year-over-year. We do think some things did this in the quarter, so let me comment on that. The economy in Europe is not doing well. We think this impacted our results. We also saw some economic impact in the natural resource space economies, including Australia, Brazil and Canada. As Tim discussed regarding iPhone, we\u2019re reading the same rumors and speculation that you are about a new iPhone, and we think this has caused some pause in customers purchasing. The timing of availability of Intel\u2019s Ivy Bridge and resulting rumors about the new portables impacted our sales in April and May. Tim talked about how after WDC we saw a large increase in sales both in terms of weekly sales before WDC and on a year-over-year basis, and customers are loving the new MacBook Pro. and we did not get the benefit of launching the new iPad in China or the new portables as we are pursuing routine regulatory approval. and finally, the dollar strengthened against most currencies around the world, which reduced our revenue growth sequentially by over $200 million net of our hedges. So, we think these things impacted the quarter. We\u2019re happy very with how the business is performing and are excited about our new product pipeline.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you for that. Tim, the question that I had for you is, whether you could talk a little bit about smartphone growth in emerging markets. China is obviously the biggest one. Some of the data that I\u2019ve seen suggest that about 70% of the smartphones that are being purchased in places like China and other emerging countries are under $300, and in many cases under $200. Do you agree with that market characterization, and at some point does that become a limit \u2013 does that limit your ability to gain share in a marketplace where its 70% of the units are at a price point that you currently don\u2019t play in? At what point does that math prevent you from gaming share, and what are your strategies for ensuring continued share going forward, if indeed that\u2019s an objective?\nTimothy D. Cook:  Toni, the specific data that you\u2019ve quoted, the 70% doesn\u2019t match to what I\u2019ve seen, but let me try to answer your general question without that specific. We\u2019ve been very focused, as you know on China, because we see it as an enormous opportunity for us. And I\u2019m very pleased that we were able to grow our iPhone sales over a 100% last quarter. And so, yes, I feel very, very good about that, and I firmly believe that people in the emerging markets won\u2019t great products like they do in developed markets and so forth. And so we\u2019re going to stick to our knitting and make the best products. And we think that if we do that, we\u2019ve got a very, very good business ahead of us. So, that\u2019s what we are doing.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And the share objected in and of itself is not an explicit one Tim, that\u2019s a consequence of making good products that either happens or it doesn\u2019t or is that an explicit objective for the iPhone business on a global basis and on an emerging markets basis?\nTimothy D. Cook:  I wouldn\u2019t go historic for the company in total, so it\u2019s not just iPhone, but across everything that we make is to make the very best product, and that\u2019s more important, and overshadows all other things. But we do believe by doing that, that we will have a great business, and I think that our results today really show that.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton:\n?:\nOperator: From Pacific Crest, we\u2019ll go to Andy Hargreaves.\nAndy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: Hi. Just first clarification, is the channel inventory commentary on a look forward basis?\nTimothy D. Cook: You are talking about the week Andy?\nAndy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: Yeah, correct.\nTimothy D. Cook: The week that we quote are forward-looking looking, because inventory is in the channel for forward sales.\nAndy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: Yeah, okay. So then the comments on iPad being just slightly within the range of four to six weeks, which seem to imply a fairly significant slowdown sequentially in sell through, can you comment on what\u2019s driving that expectation?\nTimothy D. Cook: Keep in mind that the channel inventory is only for the indirect channel. But, it\u2019s not used for to support any direct sales, and direct sales are Apple retail sales, Apple online sales, Apple education sales. And so, I don\u2019t want to give you a specific guidance on iPad sales. It\u2019s important to keep that in mind, and that\u2019s just not the case with iPad, but it\u2019s the case with all products. I know that there are some companies out there they refer to their channel inventory in terms of their gross sales, but we don\u2019t do that, because we feel very strongly that it only supports the channel sales, so that\u2019s how we calculate it.\nAndy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: Okay, thanks. And then just you\u2019ve obviously talked a fair amount of pricing umbrellas in the past, and on the iPhone side, if you don\u2019t think to address that. How are you thinking about that now on the iPad side? Now that there is some slightly higher quality competition like the Nexus 7 at lower price points?\nTimothy D. Cook: We re-priced the iPad 2 to $399, and it did very well in the quarter. The most popular iPad is the new iPad, but iPad 2 did very well. It was particularly a key in the K-12 area that Peter spoke about earlier where we sold about 1 million units for the quarter. And so, we have been very aggressive in the space, and I don\u2019t see changing that in terms of competition, we\u2019ve all seen, I think many different tablets, hundreds of them come to market over the last few year. And I have yet to see any of them really gain what I would call any level of traction at all. We have over 225,000 apps that have been optimized for iPad. There is a incredible experience on iPad, and I still think the market very much where most customers feel they\u2019re not really looking for tablet, they\u2019re just looking for an iPad. And we\u2019re going to keep innovating in the space and keep making great products, and I think we\u2019ll keep a very strong business going forward. The 17 million iPads was up 84% year-over-year, and we\u2019ve now shipped over 84 million, this is as of the end of last quarter. iPads, which if you look at that on a trajectory rate, it took us more than twice as long to achieve that on iPod and a third longer on \u2013 we achieved it in the third less time on the iPad than iPhone, so we feel really, really good about our momentum in this space.\nAndy Hargreaves \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities: Thank you.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: \n?:\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene A. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Tim, I know you just talked a little bit about the iPad that is there. You gave a little bit more information on the iPhone. Could you talk a little bit more about just what segments have been driving, you mentioned little bit of education, is it U.S. consumer, U.S. corporate market, is it channel sale in other markets, any more kind of feedback for us to help kind of navigate how to model this in the next few quarters?\nTimothy D. Cook:  Yes, sure. Gene, we\u2019re seeing, with an 84% Op year-over-year, we\u2019re seeing triple-digit growth rates in many, many geographies. Generally speaking, the international markets in the aggregate are extremely strong, in the triple-digits internationally. The U.S. is a bit lower, but I think it's important to keep in mind that the U.S. was on a faster adoption curve with iPad. And so we\u2019re thrilled with the numbers everywhere. Latin America is tripling. We\u2019re seeing growth out of the countries that are a bit border on being shocking in terms of the growth rate. We would not have dreamed of shipping over 17 million last quarter, and feel very, very good about it.\nGene A. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.: Okay. And that's helpful. And did you give maybe I missed it, but did you give an Apple TV number for the quarter and any kind of updated thoughts, and how you're thinking about that going forward?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, it's a good question. I didn\u2019t give it, but I can. We sold 1.3 million last quarter this was up over a 170% year-over-year, and it brings our fiscal year to 4 million units, which is pretty incredible. It's still at a level that we would call it a hobby. But we continue to pull the string to see where takes us and we\u2019re not one to keep around projects that we don't believe in. And so, there's a lot of people here that are believers in Apple TV and we continue to invest in it and see where it will take us.\nGene A. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.: So you don't do hobbies for the sake of hobbies, you do it to hope to get to be some bigger?\nTimothy D. Cook: That's right. We do it because we think we can, it will lead us somewhere. And so we'll see, I think this 4 million is not a small number, it's small relative to iPads and iPhones perhaps, but it\u2019s not a small number and there is a lot of believers in it.\nGene A. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.: Great, thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton:\n?:\nOperator: From JPMorgan, we will go to Mark Moskowitz.\nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yes, thank you. The first question is around ASPs, the iPad and the iPhone, the blended ASPs seem to have declined a little more this quarter versus the prior quarters. Is that a function of the product portfolio or Apple just testing price elasticity as you expand into the emerging markets?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Hi, it\u2019s Peter. The iPhone ASP, we don\u2019t talk specifically about iPad and iPhone ASPs, but I would like to give you a little bit of color this quarter, because they did change some sequentially in the case of the iPad year-over-year. Beginning with the iPhone, the ASP was down due to a higher mix of lower priced models and a stronger U.S. dollar and that was the case generally on a sequential and a year-over-year. Regarding the mix, we believe that this was largely driven by all the new product rumors, economic conditions, particularly in Europe and we had a change in the ending inventory by models that also influence the ASPs. For the iPad, it was down more year-over-year than it was sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was really attributable to four things. We had a higher mix of lower priced models, we reduced the price of the iPad 2 to $399, with our expanded distribution, we had a higher mix of indirect sales this year than we did a year ago and the dollar impacted us as well. \nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thank you, Peter for that. Tim, I want to shift gears longer-term. You talked earlier about hobbies and their relevance, what about Passbook, I\u2019m not trying to imply that it\u2019s a hobby, but could Passbook be perceived as kind of a stepping stone to Apple, have any greater role in a digital wallet in terms of the structure?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t want to comment specifically on that point, but Passbook in general is a very key feature. I think all of us have found that we were getting many passes and many tickets and so forth, they were scattered all over \u2013 maybe boarding passes, et cetera, they were scattered all over our iPhones in different apps. And so Passbook does an incredible job of pulling all of those to one place whether it\u2019s offers or passes or tickets or whatever it might be. And so it\u2019s a important feature of iOS 6 and I would want to speculate about where it might take us.\nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Mark. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Deutsche Bank, we\u2019ll go to Chris Whitmore.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up on the pricing question and as specifically around the iPad as to whether or not you think the lower price point drove elasticity of demand for that product, in other words, were your sales incrementally higher or as a result of this economic environment, did you see customers migrate down market to lower-priced products, because spending is a little tighter these days?\nTimothy D. Cook: Chris, it\u2019s Tim. The reason that we did it was because we believed that the sales would be incrementally larger that there was price elasticity and that there was a buyer that really wanted the best product and that needed it to be a little less expensive, and so I believe that we saw that. I think it did help our sales. I think it\u2019s particularly helping in K-12. The adoption rate of iPad in education is something I\u2019d never seen from any technology product in history. Usually, education tends to be a fairly conservative institution in terms of buying or K-12 does and we\u2019re not seeing that at all on the iPad. And so I think it was \u2013 it\u2019s been a big help for us and I am really glad that we did it.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: And just a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the opportunity that you see in India. A few years back, you talked about initial investments in China, and having cracked the China code, why hasn\u2019t Apple been more successful in India, and what is your outlook for growth in that geography specifically going forward?\nTimothy D. Cook: You know of course I love India, but I believe that Apple has some higher potential in the intermediate term in some other countries. And that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not putting emphasis in India, we are. We have a business there, that business is growing, but the sort of the multilayer distribution there really adds to the cost of getting products to market. And so, we\u2019re going to continue putting some energies there, but my own perspective is that in the intermediate term there will be larger opportunities outside of there.\nChris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities: Thank you very much.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Chris. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Sterne, Agee, we will hear from Shaw Wu.\nShaw Wu \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for having on. Just a quick question in terms of component availability particularly new components? Thanks.\nTimothy D. Cook: Shaw, it\u2019s Tim. We factored supply into the guidance that Peter has given you. Generally, I should say that we have been short of the MacBook Pro with the Retina displays, we ended the quarter with backlog and we are working really hard to deliver those to customers quickly and we believe that we will be in supply and demand balance in August. In terms of new products, I obviously don\u2019t talk about new products nor the parts that are in them, and so it\u2019s sort of a limit to what I can say there other than anything that we know about, we\u2019ve obviously included in the guidance and if we were short of something, you can bet that we would all be spending our energies on trying to mitigate that.\nShaw Wu \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach Group, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that color. Just a follow up on, I don't know if you could talk about in terms of the new iPad with the Retina display, I don\u2019t know, any constraints there?\nTimothy D. Cook: The iPad, the new iPad ended the quarter in just over the four-week line, which we associated with our target of four to six weeks and \u2013 in terms of channel inventory. Now that said, as a reminder, we did not ship the new iPad in Mainland China until the quarter that we\u2019re now and in Q4, but in Q3, we feel like we ended in a balanced situation.\nShaw Wu \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach Group, Inc.: Okay, thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Last, could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And that will come from Brian Marshall with ISI.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group: Great, thanks guys. Clearly Apple's design philosophy has been about building great products as opposed to kind of going in the market, hitting certain price points. But how do you think about the opportunities to address maybe some of those opportunities that are down at some of those lower price points, with your existing products without essentially compromising the core features that basically make Apple\u2019s products great.\nTimothy D. Cook: Brian, it\u2019s Tim. Our North Star is to maniacally focus on making the world\u2019s best products and economic turmoil, may push us side to side, but we\u2019re going to stay on that journey and stay focused on making the best product, and not deviate from that. We\u2019ve seen, again and again throughout the years, that during these type of periods are where we distanced ourselves further from people that don\u2019t innovate and it increases the gap between us, and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Now, when we can do that and hit more aggressive price points, we\u2019re also going to do that. And I think you\u2019ve seen that with what we did with the $399 iPad, just a few months ago. And the iPhone 3GS is free in the United States, and in several other countries. And there has been quite a lot knocked off the price of that in certain other markets. And so, our North Star that will be making the best products in the world, and that\u2019s why we breathe, that\u2019s why we live and we\u2019re not changing that.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group: Thanks. And then, when you think about how the iPhone has penetrated the planet, obviously, we\u2019ve had some pretty phenomenal success, and some of that success, there\u2019s been some downside to that as well with respect to volatility about the rumors and speculation about kind of future products being announced. And so, could you talk a little bit about how you try to manage sort of the iPhone transitions and the carrier ramp as well, I mean obviously, you mentioned not going to be launching any major countries or carriers in the September quarter, but it\u2019s widely speculated that we\u2019re going to see something later on in the year. So if you can talk a little bit about how you kind of manage that whole sort of transition/carrier ramp up that would be great? Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: Brian, we try very hard to keep our product roadmap secret and confidential, and we go to extreme, do extreme activities to try to do that. That however doesn\u2019t stop people from speculating or wondering and we\u2019ll never do that. And so it\u2019s a great thing about this country, people can say what they think and so forth. And so I'm not going to spend any energy trying to change that, that\u2019s just the environment we are in. I\u2019m glad that people want the next thing. I\u2019m super happy about it. And there is obviously, quite a few that what we\u2019re currently doing as well and as witnessed by the amount of products that we\u2019re selling. And so, I\u2019m not going to put any energy into try to get people to stop speculating. I don\u2019t think it would \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to amount anything.\nBrian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group:  Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook:  Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Brian.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking today is Apple CFO, Peter Oppenheimer; and he'll be joined by Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and Treasurer, Gary Wipfler for the Q&A session with analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, earnings per share and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2011, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the attached press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. We're very pleased to report the results of our outstanding second fiscal quarter. We established new March quarter records for iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, leading to our highest March quarter revenue and earnings ever. Revenue for the quarter was $39.2 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 59%. That's a new record for a March quarter and is second only to the all-time record revenue we reported in the most recent December quarter. The year-over-year increase in March quarter revenue was fueled primarily by very strong growth in iPhone and iPad sales. Operating margin was $15.4 billion, representing 39.3% of revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion, increasing 94% over the prior March quarter's result. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $12.30. Turning to the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established new March quarter records for both desktops and portables, combining for a total of 4 million Macs sold. This represents growth of 7% year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 2% growth for the global personal computer market in the March quarter. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory, which is below our target range of 4 to 5 weeks. In February, we released the developer preview of Mountain Lion, the ninth major release of Mac OS X. Mountain Lion will bring popular apps and features from iPad to the Mac, including Messages, Notes, Reminders, Game Center, Notification Center, Share Sheets, Twitter integration and AirPlay Mirroring. We expect Mountain Lion to be available from the Mac App Store in late summer this year. Moving to our music products. We sold 7.7 million iPods compared to 9 million in the year ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations, and iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod's share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD, and iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory. The iTunes Store generated all-time record results with revenue of almost $1.9 billion in the March quarter, an increase of 35% year-over-year, thanks to continued strong sales of music, video and apps. We now have a catalog of over 28 million songs and 45,000 movies. I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell 35.1 million iPhones compared to 18.6 million in the previous March quarter. That represents 88% year-over-year growth compared to 42% growth for the smartphone market overall in the March quarter based on the latest published estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth in all of our segments, led by our Asia Pacific and Japan segments where sales more than doubled year-over-year. We continue to see tremendous momentum in Greater China, where iPhone sales were 5x the level of the year ago quarter, aided by the launch of the iPhone 4S in China in January and the addition of China Telecom as an iPhone carrier in March. IPhone 4S is now available in over 100 countries and is sold through over 230 carriers. We ended the quarter with about 8.6 million iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 2.6 million units, which placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $22.7 billion during the quarter compared to $12.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 85%. iPhone momentum in the enterprise has evolved beyond email, calendar and contacts. IT and business line managers across industries see the opportunity to leverage both company and employee-owned devices to improve productivity and efficiencies through iOS in-house app development. In fact, the majority of the Fortune 500 companies who have approved iPhone on their networks are members of the iOS Developer Enterprise Program and are actively deploying in-house applications to their employee base. Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with sales of 11.8 million iPads during the March quarter compared to 4.7 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 151%. Customers are loving the new iPad with its stunning Retina display, A5X chip with Quad-core graphics and the 5-megapixel iSight camera. The new iPad is now available in over 40 countries, and we saw a very strong growth in iPad sales around the world with sales more than doubling in each of our segments. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter was $6.6 billion compared to $2.8 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 132%. We ended the quarter with about 2 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential decrease of about 300,000 units, which placed us below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory. The education market's interest in iPad continues to grow. In the March quarter, we sold more than 2 iPads for every Mac to our U.S. K-12 customers while also generating a record quarter for Mac sales. The San Diego School District purchased 10,000 iPads in the March quarter and plans to purchase over 15,000 more in the June quarter for middle school and high school programs. iPad continues to open doors to new customers with whom Apple previously had no relationship. As we enter the K-12 institution buying season, we're hopeful that iPad will be a popular choice. iPad's momentum in business and government also continues to build. The United States Air Force Air Mobility Command is deploying thousands of iPads to serve as electronic flight bags, storing technical publications and operations information for flight crew members and trainers. Companies such as Bechtel and Balfour Beatty are using iPads in the field for project management and viewing blueprints. And thousands of iPads are being deployed as mobile sales tools by companies such as Roche, Amgen, Bayer and Daiichi Sankyo. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 365 cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 50 million in the March quarter. The iOS ecosystem continues to expand and thrive with stores in more than 120 countries. The App Store now offers more than 600,000 apps, including over 200,000 apps specifically for iPad. We were very excited to announce the download of the 25th billionth app in March less than 4 years after the launch of the App Store. And iCloud is off to an incredible start, currently with more than 125 million customers signed up since its launch in October. I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record March quarter results. Revenue was $4.4 billion, an increase of 38% over the year ago quarter and was second only to the record quarterly revenue generated in the December quarter. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in iPad and iPhone sales, and they sold 826,000 Macs compared to 797,000 in the year ago quarter. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the March quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened 2 new stores in the quarter, including our first Netherlands store in Amsterdam and a beautiful new store in Houston. We exited the quarter with 363 stores, nearly 1/3 of which are outside the United States. With an average of 361 stores open, average revenue per store was $12.2 million compared to $9.9 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 23%. Segment margin reached a new March quarter record of over $1.1 billion, which was 26.1% of retail revenue. We welcomed 85 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 71 million visitors in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%. That translates to an average of 18,000 visitors per store per week. Total company gross margin was 47.4%, which was 540 basis points higher than our guidance. About half this difference was driven by lower-than-expected commodity and other costs; about 1/4 was due to stronger-than-expected revenue and product mix, including 35 million iPhones; and the remainder was due to some onetime items that we don't expect to recur in the June quarter. Operating expenses were $3.2 billion and included $361 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $148 million. Turning to cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $110.2 billion at the end of the March quarter compared to $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential increase of $12.6 billion. And about $74 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the March quarter. Cash flow from operations was $14 billion. As we indicated last month, subject to board declaration, we expect to announce a dividend of $2.65 [ph] per share when we report our third quarter results in July. And we will provide information on the record and payment dates at that time. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $34 billion compared to $28.6 billion in the June quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 41.5%, reflecting approximately $70 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.3 billion, including about $385 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $175 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.68. In closing, we're extremely pleased with our record March quarter performance with earnings nearly doubling year-over-year. The new iPad is off to a tremendous start and is our fastest iPad rollout ever. We're thrilled with the global success of the iPhone 4S, which is now available in more than 100 countries, including China. We remain very confident in our strategy, and we're very excited about the fabulous new products in our pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: As it relates to the June quarter revenue guidance, it implies a sequential downtick that is worse than the guidance message you provided over the last 3 years. So can you just talk about some of the headwinds sequentially you see on the top line in the June quarter relative to March?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure, Katy. It's Peter. The manufacturing ramps for the iPhone 4S and the new iPad were extremely successful for us. They yielded the highest launch supply and the fastest country rollouts for these product families that we've ever had. As a result, we were able to fulfill demand in the March quarter rather than the June quarter this year, and that generated revenue of over $39 billion. Therefore, unlike last year, we expect a sequential decline in revenue this year. I'd highlight 5 primary factors that have influenced our thinking: The first, the iPhone channel inventory changes. As I discussed in my prepared remarks, we increased our iPhone channel inventory by about 2.6 million units in the March quarter this year, and we exited within our target inventory range of about 4 to 6 weeks. Last year, we continued to add new countries into the June quarter, and we built an additional 700,000 units of iPhone channel inventory last year in the June quarter. So the combination of these channel builds in the March quarter of this year and the June quarter of last year will impact the sequential comparisons from this year to last. The second factor: fabulous iPhone 4S execution. As we told you in January, we exited December with significant iPhone 4S backlog, which led to a huge January. We launched China and 20 other countries also in January, which completed the rollout of the iPhone 4S into all the countries where iPhone is currently shipping. And as I said before, we exited the quarter within a supply and demand balance. The third factor: our new iPad execution was also fabulous. We had an incredible start with the new iPad. We launched with significant supply, leading to sales of 3 million units in the first couple of days, which was the -- and also the fastest country rollout ever. We therefore were able to satisfy much more of the demand for the new iPad in the March quarter this year compared to the iPad 2 in the March quarter of last year. This resulted in a shift of iPad volume into March this year versus last, and it will also affect the sequential compares this year to the last. Fourth, we decreased the entry price of the entry iPad to $399. And finally, the last factor to point out, the U.S. dollar has strengthened recently, and we expect this to have an impact on the sequential compare, especially versus last year when the dollar weakened against most currencies over the comparable time periods. We -- look, we've just reported the most amazing March quarter Apple has ever had. We feel very, very good about our business and our new product pipeline.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just as a quick follow-up to number 4, the decrease in iPad price. You already saw a 7% sequential decline in March, which suggests that the uptake of the lower-priced iPad 2 was pretty phenomenal in March. Is that the right way to read it? And what does that demand tell you about the potential to move to lower price points on the iPad over time and see significant incremental demand?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Look, Katy, we're just learning about be the elasticity of demand and the $399 price point. It's doing well. But I have to tell you, the new iPad is on fire, and we're selling them as fast as we can make them. So we'll learn more over this quarter especially as we get through the education buying season, which looks terrific for us especially on the iPad.\nOperator: From Citigroup, we'll go to Richard Gardner.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I recognize that you outgrew the market in Macs yet again. But I did want to get your views on the slowdown in year-over-year growth rate within the category and what factors you would attribute that to. Are we -- is it product transition related? Were the inventories down quarter-over-quarter? iPad cannibalization? Any other color that you can provide would be helpful.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, Rich, it's Tim. As you said, we did outgrow the market. Macs grew at about 7% where the market grew about 2%. And so this is the 24th straight quarter that we've outgrown the market, and so we're extremely pleased with that. The compare to last year is largely affected by the fact that we changed the bulk of our portable line, or the MacBook Pros, in the February time frame of 2011. And so it's a very tough compare. Specifically, the portables last year were up 53% year-on-year. And obviously, that -- so that compare was very difficult. If you look at it sequentially, you also have to factor in that we had 14 weeks in the December quarter. And so the 26% year-over-year growth in December quarter is probably more like 17% when you factor out that 14th week. And so yes, I think there was some cannibalization from iPad and the market is slow. But the much, much larger factor and in fact, in -- it might be the vast majority of the difference is the compare to a year ago.\nOperator: We'll go to -- [indiscernible] we'll go to Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nA.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I was wondering if you could talk more broadly just about what you might be learning about lower priced -- price points on both the iPhone and iPad. I know it was asked earlier. But was the decrease in iPad price exclusively mix related? Or are there -- or is it a further broadening of your channel to indirect partners? But more broadly, Tim, maybe you could talk about elasticity, what you're learning about customer preferences for lower-priced offerings on both the iPhone and iPad. And I do have a follow-up, please.\nTimothy D. Cook: Sure. Tony, on iPad 2, we're -- with the change in the entry price to $399, we're actually thrilled with the results that we've seen, although, as Peter said, it's only been a few weeks. And so it's too early to make a -- come to a clear conclusion. But from what we are seeing, this unlocks some education demand that is probably a more price-sensitive customer. Also, in several other countries, there was a marked change in demand at that price point. And so on the early going, we feel great about it. But I'd also point out that the new iPad is -- was current -- was supply constrained last quarter for the full 3 weeks or so it was shipping and is actually still constrained. And so the mix of the new iPad to the iPad 2, we're not certain of what that is yet. But we are certain, with what we've seen so far, that the absolute sales of iPad 2, at least in the early going, is very exciting. On the iPhone, we continue to be very happy with the moves that we made in pricing just a few months ago on the iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4. And both of them contributed to our ability to achieve 35 million in sales, which is our second highest quarter of all time.\nA.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: The -- as a second question, I was wondering if you can talk about how you think about the markets for tablet and PC devices going forward. I think you've been fairly clear about saying that you believe that tablets will eclipse PCs in volume at some point. And I think you've also said they're somewhat discrete markets. There seems to be a lot of work, particularly on PC-based platforms, towards trying to combine the PC and tablet experience going forward in part because Windows 8 will be able to -- is a touch-based operating system as well. Can you comment about why you don't believe the PC or the Ultrabook and tablet markets or your MacBook Air and tablet markets won't converge? Isn't it realistic to think in a couple of years we're going to have a device that's under 2 pounds with great battery life that we can all carry around and open as a notebook or close up in a clever way and use as a tablet? Can you comment on why you don't think that product might not come or why you believe these markets are separate?\nTimothy D. Cook: I think, Tony, anything can be forced to converge. But the problem is that products are about trade-offs, and you begin to make trade-offs to the point where what you have left at the end of the day doesn't please anyone. You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not going to be pleasing to the user. And so our view is that the tablet market is huge. And we've said that since day one. We didn't wait until we had a lot of results. We were using them here, and it was already clear to us that there was so much you could do and that the reasons that people would use those would be so broad. And that's precisely what we've seen. We -- the iPad has taken off not only in consumer in a meaningful way but in education and in enterprise, and it's sort of everywhere you look now. And the applications are so easy to make very meaningful for someone, and there -- the -- there's such an abundance of those that -- and as the ecosystem gets better and better and as we continue to double down on making great products, I think that the limit here is nowhere in sight. We've now -- through the last quarter, I should say, which is just 2 years after we shipped the initial iPad, we\u2019ve sold 67 million. And to put that in some context, it took us 24 years to sell that many Macs and 5 years for that many iPods and over 3 years for that many iPhones. And we were extremely happy with the trajectory on all of those products. And so I think iPad, it's a profound product. It -- the breadth of it is incredible, and the appeal of it is universal. And so I am -- I could not be happier with being in the market, and the level at which we're innovating in both the product and the ecosystem here is incredible. Now in terms of the market itself, IDC and Gartner and Forrester had some numbers out there. I think Gartner is saying there's somewhere around 375 or so by 2015. Forrester is 375, somewhere around there. And so basically, the -- they're in the mid-300s, which is about where the PC market is today. And 2015 is only 3 years from now. And so I think even the more formal predictors outside of us are beginning to see these lines cross. And so I strongly believe that they will. Now having said that, I also believe that there is a very good market for the MacBook Air, and we continue to innovate in that product. And -- but I do think that it appeals to somewhat -- someone that has a little bit different requirements. And you wouldn't want to put these things together because you wind up compromising in both and not pleasing either user. Some people will prefer to own both, and that's great, too. But I think to make the compromises of convergence, so -- we're not going to that party. Others might. Others might from a defensive point of view, particularly. But we're going to play in both.\nOperator: We'll go to Bill Shope at Goldman Sachs.\nBill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Tim, there's been quite a bit of concern both in the press and within the investment community around carrier subsidies. And I think the concerns are generally twofold: First, that carriers will attempt to stretch out the replacement cycle. And second, that over time, carriers across the globe will attempt to reduce subsidies significantly. I mean, how do you think about this risk? And do you think there are factors that could pressure subsidies going forward? And how would that impact Apple?\nTimothy D. Cook: Well, Bill, our focus is on making the very best smartphone in the world. And a phone that delivers a -- just an off-the-charts user experience that customers want to use every day of their lives. And at the end of the day, I think that carriers, the vast majority of carriers, or maybe even all carriers, want to provide what their customers want to buy. And that's what they're motivated for. And so the most important thing by far is for Apple to continue making great products that customers want. And we are deeply committed to doing this and are innovating at a rate and pace that's unbelievable in this area. For -- from a carrier's perspective, I think it's important to remember that the subsidy is not large relative to the sum of the monthly payments across a 24-month contract period. And any delta between iPhone and maybe another phone is a -- an even smaller level of difference. And the iPhone has some distinct advantages for the carrier over competing smartphones. For example, many of the carrier executives have told me that churn from iPhone customers is the lowest of any phone they sell in their whole -- in all of the phones they carry. And that has a significant direct financial benefit to the carrier. Also, our engineering teams work extremely hard to be efficient with data and differently than some others. And we believe that as a result of this, that iPhone has far better data efficiency compared to other smartphones that are using sort of an app-rich ecosystem. Finally, we think that the -- and this is the most important, is that iPhone is the best smartphone on the planet to entice a customer who is currently using a traditional mobile phone to upgrade to a smartphone. This is by far the largest opportunity for Apple, for our carrier partners and is a great, fantastic experience to the customer. And so there's a win-win-win there. And so I think all of these factors are -- some of these factors are missed in this general discussion of subsidy.\nBill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: That's helpful. I had one other follow-up question, if I could. I appreciate the user stats you gave us on iCloud. But can you give us any color, now it's been out for a few months, on how consumers are actually using iCloud? And in particular, are you seeing a big uptake in iTunes Match and paid storage additions? And how should we think about that?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Bill, it's Peter. Customers are using all the features of iCloud. Response has been terrific. Feedback has been terrific. Pickup on storage is occurring, but it's growing because we've just launched iCloud in October. And we've now got over 125 million users that have come on to the service since then and they're building up documents in music and other things that they want to store. And so I think storage growth will come more over time. Our real desire here was not about selling more storage. We think Match is a great product, and we recommend that everybody use it. But it's a paid for service. We just really wanted to increase the customer delight from the entire ecosystem and platform of our iOS devices and the Mac, and that's why we've done iCloud. And we just -- we couldn't be happier that just a couple months into this, there's more than 125 million users around the world on iCloud.\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.\nCharles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: If you could dig a little bit more into what's going on in China. I know you gave some high-level numbers. But is this increased distribution points, is it just price elasticity of lower-priced 3GS? Is it more people in China having money? All of the above? Anything that you can tell us to explain this vertical growth?\nTimothy D. Cook: Gene, it was an incredible quarter in China. We -- the revenue was record -- was a record at $7.9 billion in Greater China, which is up over 3x year-over-year and brings the first half revenue for Greater China to $12.4 billion. That compares to a full year last year of $13.3 billion. So it is mind-boggling that we can do this well. A part of this was the pent-up demand for iPhone 4S. As you know, we launched mainland China in January of this year, and so China was not able to get into the Q1 period. So all of that is in Q2. We also have very strong demand for iPad 2. We have not shipped in mainland China yet the new iPad, although we are shipping in Hong Kong. And so it's a combination of these things. And the halo that both of these products have produced for the Mac is also incredible. Mac was up over 60% year-over-year. And that compares to a market rate of growth of about 6%. We have expanded point of sales. On a year-over-year basis, Mac is up 70% but still only 1,800 for all of Greater China. And so there's obviously a lot more opportunity there. iPhone, we're up over 11,000, which is 138%. But 11,000 is a much smaller number than we have in the U.S., and obviously, China will, in the next few years, be a bigger opportunity. iPad is only in 2,500 points of sale. And so yes, we've expanded. We've expanded a lot. However, there's a lot of headroom here in our view.\nCharles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: Was the iPhone mix in China different than the rest of the world? Or how was it different?\nTimothy D. Cook: I don't have that in front of me, but my recollection is that it wasn\u2019t materially different. But keep in mind that iPhone 4S just launched in -- within the quarter. And so usually, when a new product launches within the quarter, you would expect it to mix fairly much toward the new product.\nCharles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: And just one final quick question on iTunes content. It seems that there's kind of this logjam to getting more TV shows and movies and the rentals, and it's been a little bit of a slow pace of improvement. How important is getting better content on iTunes? And what's going to break that logjam?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Gene, it's Peter. We're actually thrilled with the rate that we're adding content into iTunes. This is something that we have to do country by country, so it takes a bit of time to put in place. We have the largest catalog of songs and movies available anywhere, over 28 million songs. And this led to almost $1.9 billion of revenue in the March quarter, which was up 35% year-over-year. So we're thrilled with the progress that we're making in iTunes and customers love it.\nOperator: And that will come from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.\nBenjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Tim, the other big issue outside of the subsidy question that you just answered a couple of calls ago was regarding shortages. There's talk about potential Qualcomm shortages into the next couple of quarters and potential constraints even at year end for some pretty neat products that might be good for you to have in some products down the road. I know you don't comment on future products, but this is a big concern. And I guess can you just talk directionally about whether you expect long term to get your -- more than your fair share of product and what you need? And do you see any bottlenecks on the horizon that are major in that department or in any component down the line over the long term?\nTimothy D. Cook: Tough question to answer, Ben. Obviously, we're aware of the lithography transition issue that you mentioned with 28 nanometer. We currently do not use 28-nanometer parts. But as you also know, we don't comment about future products, and so I can't talk about the future part. Generally, outside of this, we work very closely with our supplier partners and do everything that we can do to get supply. And sometimes, we're successful with that, and sometimes we're not. And so you can bet that we are focused on anything that we think may impact us and trying to push every button within our disposal to work on it.\nBenjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Well, I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is regarding Walmart. They were actually just in our building in a conference here talking about how they're moving from one store in Arkansas now to 25 stores. And they seem really pleased with the \"store within a store\" concept. How is it going? And when can you be in all 10,000 stores?\nTimothy D. Cook: There's no plan to be in 10,000. And so we're trying some things. And as you know, that doesn't include the Mac. And so we're trying some things and seeing how it goes. And they've been a very good partner for us on iPod and have been selling iPods for a while and are an increasingly more substantial partner in the iPad space as well and an evolving partner on iPhone. And so we're working with them and enjoy working with them and hope to continue expanding.\nOperator: That will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al.\nKeith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Tim, for you, I think. Could you add some more specifics on iPhones in Asia Pacific, including China? Is supply-demand in balance there? Or that -- can that be a help? And then more broadly, with iPhones getting increased inventory of 2.6 million units, will that be a -- will that, in fact, go down in the June quarter? Is there any comments, you could provide there? And then I have a follow-up, please.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, let me start with the -- your last question. On the 2.6 million, our desire, just to be very clear on this, our desire was to increase inventory -- channel inventory across the quarter. As you might recall, we ended with only 6 million units in the channel coming out of December because we were extremely backlogged. And this is on particularly -- this is on 4S specifically. Our target is to be between 4 million and 6 million. The addition of the 2.6 million allowed us to get within that range by the end of the quarter. And so we feel that we exited the quarter as supply and demand balanced. Because our execution, the ops team was so good, the vast majority of the supply-demand in the different countries was reached by the end of January. And so we had the mother of all Januarys with the -- with really getting out of the vast majority of the iPhone 4S backlog and launching China as well. And so it was an incredible, incredible start of the quarter for us. Your other question was?\nKeith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: On China specifically. It sounds like China can still be a help. Or it sounds like China is still supply-demand imbalanced. But I wanted to see if you could add some thoughts [ph] there in terms of iPhones.\nTimothy D. Cook: No. China is not supply-demand imbalanced on iPhone. On iPad, worldwide, we're supply constrained on the new iPad, both coming out of last quarter. And to give you a current view, we're still supply constrained on the new iPad. Demand has been incredibly robust, and we are selling them as fast as we can make them, as Peter mentioned earlier. In China, I believe on a macro basis, China has an enormous number of people moving into the higher income groups, middle class, if you will. And this is creating a demand for goods, not just Apple's but other companies' goods as well. And so I think there's a tremendous opportunity for companies that understand China, and we're doing everything we can to understand it and serve the market as good as we can.\nKeith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: It certainly seems so. Tim, for my follow-up from Bill Shope's question, there have been some changes in Spain in particular on the behavior of their carriers and the economics. And Vodafone has actually changed some of their subsidy levels. It's only been about 30 days or 35 days, but have you seen any changes in demand levels in the Spanish market as a consequence of some of the activities of the carriers? And that's it for me.\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes. Keith, Spain has been weak for us and probably more broadly for many companies. We -- our revenues grew in Spain last quarter but materially less than we grew in Europe or worldwide. However, that wasn't cause and effect related to the issue you're on, that Spain is just in a, I think, terrible economic situation. And so I sort of look at that as an unusual case. To be clear about what was done, is that -- I think there's also some noise in the pike on this one. What the carriers did was they still have subsidies for their existing customers. And I don't want to talk about what the -- their existing customer-to-new customer ratio is, but you can find out numbers from different parts of the world and model that. They pulled subsidies on new customers. And so it wasn't a pull of all subsidies, it was a pull of subsidies from new. And it -- all carriers in that market did not do that. A couple of the carriers did. So I wouldn't necessarily use that as a proxy for the world, I guess, is my point.\nOperator: From JPMorgan, we'll go to Mark Moskowitz.\nMark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A question for Peter. Peter, can you provide a little more framework or context for us in terms of understanding how the segments dovetail with the 13% sequential revenue decline in the guidance? In terms of that bogey, what product segments could be higher in terms of decline or less than the decline?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Go ahead, Tim.\nMark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Oh, sorry. Go ahead.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. iPhone, well, we would expect to have a year-over-year increase and a sequential decrease for the reasons that both Tim and I discussed. We built channel inventory in the March quarter, and we are exiting March in supply and demand balance. And we had a huge January. And for iPad, we would have a significant -- expect to have a significant year-over-year and sequential increase in sales. And I've got a -- I want to put something out just so it gets out on the call in case it's not asked and talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance that we provided for the June quarter. We're pleased to be providing a gross margin guidance of 41.5% for the quarter. We expect about 2/3 of the sequential decline to be primarily driven by a higher mix of iPads and Macs, a full quarter of selling the current iPad lineup and lots of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. And we would expect the remainder of the difference to be primarily driven by the items benefiting the March quarter gross margin that we don't expect to recur in June.\nNancy Paxton: And Mark, did you have a second question?\nMark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes. Tim, Tim, can you hear me?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, I can now.\nMark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, great. Sorry about that. So just in terms of the -- your flexibility or versatility, you've been flexible here recently in terms of your cash usage as well as just providing more color or commentary during your earnings call. I was just wondering how we should think about opportunities for incremental flexibility as it relates to patent disputes. Is there a point where Apple maybe feels it reasonable to settle and just continue out-innovating and outgunning the competition rather than wage an ongoing litigation? Are there opportunities for that?\nTimothy D. Cook: I've always hated litigation, and I continue to hate it. We just want people to invent their own stuff. And so if we could get to some kind of arrangement where we could be assured that's the case and a fair settlement on the stuff that's occurred, I would highly prefer to settle versus battle. But it -- the key thing is that it's very important that Apple not become the developer for the world. We need people to invent their own stuff.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research Group.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: My first question is just going back to iCloud. Perhaps Tim, if you can talk a little bit more about feedback from customers? Curious sort of average number of devices of customers that customers are putting up or maybe percent of users attaching more than one device. Just sort of what's the initial feedback? And then I have a follow-up.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Shannon, it's Peter. I don't want to frustrate you, but, well, we have, of course, the data that you're asking for, but we don't want to help our competitors. And so it's not something that we're going to provide probably. The feedback that we're getting from customers on iCloud is just it's off the charts. They're loving it. And the fact that we could be here on the conference call with you in April just 5 or 6 months after introducing the service and have 125 million people around the world using it every day, I think, speaks for itself.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Okay. And then my follow-up question is just on R&D. I mean, it was up 45%. It's over $800 million now. I'm curious. So was a chunk of the growth from the acquisitions you've made? Or is there anything you can tell us in terms of your thoughts on R&D and investment levels? Because it's definitely been ramping, which, I guess, bodes for good products coming for -- in the future.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Well, we view this as a good thing. We are investing in engineering to continue to bring out the most innovative products in the world to delight customers. We are making investments in our hardware and software engineering teams. We're shipping the best products that Apple has ever shipped today. And we've got some fabulous new products in the pipeline. So I'm very confident in the return that we're going to see on these investments.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: You used to give sort of an idea of percentage to software, percentage of hardware. Is there anything you can give there?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Shannon, I'm sorry. I don't have that in front of me.\nOperator: From Sterne Agee, we'll go to Shaw Wu.\nShaw Wu - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division: Just a quick clarification. I understand you disclosed China in terms of the 4S shipping along with 21 countries early in January. What about China Telecom specifically? When did that launch?\nTimothy D. Cook: Shaw, it's Tim. We launched with China Telecom in March. And in early part of March, we were at a supply-demand balance with them prior to the end of the quarter. We're very happy to be working with them.\nOperator: From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we'll go to Scott Craig.\nScott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Peter, on the OpEx side, that's an area where you guys have been getting a fair amount of leverage. If you look year-over-year, it's down pretty significantly as a percentage of sales. So I'm just curious on your thoughts going forward, maybe not just next quarter but sort of how do you think about the OpEx leverage longer term? And then, Tim, can you just kind of take us through the components like you do on most quarter calls and where you're seeing some pricing better than expected and maybe worse than expected and put that in the context of going forward as well?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes, Scott, it's Peter. We are, as I discussed in Shannon's question, investing in R&D to introduce the most innovative products in the market. We are also spending on marketing, advertising, opening more of our own retail stores and expanding our indirect channels around the world to increase sales. And we're investing in infrastructure to support our growth and also stock-based comp for our employees. We are very confident in the investments that we're making. We're thinking about the long term, and we're confident in the returns that we're going to get in -- on these investments.\nTimothy D. Cook: Scott, in terms of component costs for the quarter we just finished, Q2 component costs were better than we had planned, and this assisted us in exceeding our gross margin guidance, as Peter talked about earlier. Displays and NAND flash drove the majority of the favorable commodity cost benefit. In terms of the June quarter and the -- what we factored into our guidance, NAND and mobile DRAM supply continued to exceed demand. And because of that, we expect pricing will continue to be favorable. For most LCDs, we expect pricing to stabilize as the market moves to a supply-demand balance. The hard drive market has moved to a supply-demand balance, and we expect marketing -- market pricing to decline but will still be higher than the pre-flood level from the tragedy in Thailand. Most other components are expected to fall in line with or somewhat faster than historical trends.\nOperator: And we'll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.\nKulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Just a clarification, Pete. Did you say that 2/3 of the sequential gross margin decline was basically due to products? And did I hear that right? Can you clarify that? Because it seems like quite a rapid drop, and I'm just wondering how much conservatism is in your gross margin guidance. And then I have a follow-up for Tim afterwards.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure, Kulbinder, the 2/3 that I talked about, the sequential decline, we see as being driven by a higher mix of iPads and Macs, a full quarter of selling the current lineup of the iPad or the current iPad lineup, and then a loss of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue. So those 3 factors we see driving 2/3 of the sequential decline.\nKulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, Tim, just a question on the enterprise side. You mentioned a couple of times how the iPad is being taken into new markets, new verticals, whether it's because of the price point of the innovation. I'm just wondering specifically what resources is Apple dedicating to have a much more direct relationship with the enterprise? Can you speak on what's changed in the last 6 or 12 months and what you think you need to do to become a more credible or significant enterprise player?\nTimothy D. Cook: Initially, our focus was on working with the Fortune 500 and the Global 500 to get the iPad certified for their particular enterprise. And I'm pleased to report that 94% of the Fortune 500 are testing or deploying iPads and 75% of the Global 500 are testing or deploying the iPad. So these numbers are just off the charts for a product that's only 24 months old. And so we are moving our focus away from this and focusing on penetration within these accounts. Peter alluded to some of the wins that we have had in the -- his opening comments. The incredible things about these are that they span across many verticals, through government, through education, and many different functions within the enterprise. It's absolutely the most broad-based product I have ever seen in my whole career in terms of adoption rate into the enterprise. And so yes, this means that we're applying more resources in Fes [ph] and salespeople to interact directly with these customers. We also work with our carrier partners and our reseller partners in delivering both the products and services that are wrapped around that to these customers.\nOperator: We'll go to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nNancy Paxton: Chris, are you there?\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Hello? Can you hear me?\nNancy Paxton: Yes, we can.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay, sorry about that. If I take your revenue guidance and the comments you made around gross margin at face value, it seems to imply that you expect iPhone unit sales to be down about 10 million units quarter-on-quarter. First, is that in the right ballpark? And secondly, are you just being conservative with respect to the outlook? Or have you seen a change in the end demand environment for the phone?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Chris, let me sort of go in reverse order. We are incredibly confident in our business, our strategy and what we're doing. When we give you guidance, we give you guidance that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. And finally, we do expect a sequential decline in iPhone sales driven by the fact that we built 2.6 million units of channel inventory in the March quarter, which we needed to do. We're now within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks, and we entered the March quarter with significant backlog, as we talked about, in January. And we're able to fulfill that and launch 20 countries in the month of January. So \u2013- we have immense confidence in what we're doing and are very pleased with the way our business is performing.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: A follow-up, if I could, on iPad. It is supply constrained across many geos, as you talked about. Is there a specific component issue? Do you have visibility on resolution? When do you expect to be able to meet demand in the iPad?\nTimothy D. Cook: It's hard to answer meet the demand. What I'm confident about, however, is that we will be able to supply a significant number of iPads during the quarter, and I feel very, very confident about that. It's tough to know precisely that it will balance until you get there, but I'm very confident with the improving supply and that the total number will be very significant.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Chris.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. We are thrilled to report the results of a tremendous quarter, generating the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in Apple's history. We established numerous new records during the quarter, including all-time highs for quarterly iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. We are very proud of these results and are extremely pleased with the momentum of our business. Revenue for the quarter was $46.3 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 73%. The increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, and was also aided by the inclusion of a 14th week in the quarter, which we indicated previously. Operating margin was $17.3 billion, representing 37.4% of revenue. Net income was $13.1 billion, increasing 118% over the prior December quarter's results, and equaling half of the net income generated in all of fiscal 2011. The quarter's net income translated to earnings per share of $13.87. Turning to the details of the quarter. I'd like to begin with our Mac products and services. We established a new all-time quarterly record with sales of 5.2 million Macs, setting new records for both desktops and portables. Mac sales grew 26% year-over-year compared to IDC's latest published forecast of 0 growth for the market overall in the December quarter. While total Mac sales benefited from the 14th week, average weekly Mac sales were up strongly year-over-year across the quarter. Mac sales outgrew the market in each of our geographies with particular strength in our Asia-Pacific segment where sales were up 58% year-over-year. The increase in Mac sales was fueled by very strong growth of MacBook Pro and MacBook Air, as well as the continued strong performance of iMac. We began and ended the quarter with between 3 and 4 weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look-forward basis. As we announced last month, the Mac App Store has been a great success with customers downloading over 100 million apps in less than a year. The Mac App Store offers thousands of apps in education, games, graphics and design, lifestyle, productivity, utilities and other categories, and has rapidly become a favorite shopping destination for Mac software. Moving to our music products. We sold 15.4 million iPods compared to 19.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Total iPod sales were ahead of our expectations and iPod touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold. iPod share of the U.S. market for MP3 players remains at over 70% based on the latest monthly data published by MPD. And iPod continued to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK. We ended the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPod channel inventory on a look-forward basis. The iTunes Store generated record results with revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion. During the quarter, we launched iTunes music stores in Brazil as well as 27 other countries in Latin America and Europe, now offering a catalog of over 20 million songs from major recording labels, as well as thousands of independent artists. And iTunes customers were amazingly busy on December 25, generating over 140 million downloads of apps and content that day. I'd now like to turn to iPhone. We were thrilled to sell a record 37 million iPhones compared to 16.2 million in the previous December quarter. This represents 128% year-over-year growth compared to 40% growth for the smartphone market overall in the December quarter, based on the latest published estimate from IDC. We experienced very strong iPhone sales growth in all of our segments, thanks primarily to the tremendous popularity of iPhone 4S. Customers have been captivated by Siri, which let's them use their voices to send messages, place phone calls, schedule appointments and more. Siri understands what users say, knows what they mean and helps them with everyday tasks and information requests. iPhone channel inventory increased sequentially by about 200k, leaving us with a little under 6 million iPhones in the channel at the end of the quarter, and below our target range of 4 to 6 weeks on a look-forward basis. Recognized revenue from iPhone handset and accessory sales was $24.4 billion during the quarter compared to $10.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 133%. Nearly all of the top companies in the Fortune 500 now approve and support iPhone on their networks. This includes companies in markets such as financial services, consumer products, transportation, healthcare and insurance. iPhone is changing the way companies across the globe use mobile devices for work. In addition to accessing e-mail, calendar and contacts, many of these companies are developing and deploying mission-critical iPhone apps to help improve productivity and give employees secure and immediate access to information anywhere. Many companies around the world have thousands of employees using iPhone and business apps. Some new examples include Royal Dutch Shell, Credit Suisse, Kimberly-Clark, St. Jude Medical, Providian, Teradata, Nike, [indiscernible] and Facebook. We were very pleased to begin shipping iPhone 4S in China and 21 additional countries earlier this month. iPhone 4S is now available in over 90 countries, making this our fastest iPhone rollout ever. Turning to iPad. We were very pleased with record sales of 15.4 million iPads during the December quarter compared to 7.3 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 111%. iPad was extremely popular with holiday season buyers, and we remain very excited about the potential for this market. Recognized revenue from sales of iPad and iPad accessories during the quarter increased by 99% year-over-year to over $9.1 billion compared to $4.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales surpassed our expectations with sell-through exceeding sell-in by about 200,000 units. We exited the quarter within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis. iPad continues its unprecedented adoption in business. Nearly all of the top companies within major Fortune 500 markets including pharma, manufacturing, hospitality, consumer products, financial services, healthcare and retail are actively using iPad to improve workflows, business processes and customer engagements. We are delighted to learn how iPad enables businesses to change the way they work. Real estate agents at Coldwell Banker and Sotheby's access sales presentations and use custom iPad apps in the field. Retail chains such as Bed Bath & Beyond use iPads to deliver key business metrics on the sales floor. Wineries are using iPads in their vineyards to call up weather data and soil profiles, record quality assessments and make decisions on the spot about whether to harvest their grapes. And in this past quarter, Chinese airline, EVA, has also deployed iPads to pilots and crew for flight manuals, documentation and training.  iPad is extremely popular with students, teachers and administrators as a wonderfully engaging and powerful tool for teaching and learning. Today, 1.5 million iPads are already in use in education institutions, including over 1,000 one-to-one deployments. We were very pleased to announce iBooks 2 last week featuring iBook Textbooks to deliver educational content that is more interactive, current and portable than ever from leading publishers, including Houghton Mifflin, McGraw-Hill and Pearson, as well as thousands of independent publishers. And with iBooks Author, anyone with a Mac can create iBook textbooks, cookbooks, picture books and more, and publish them to Apple's iBook Store. And over 600,000 copies of iBooks Author have already been downloaded since last Thursday's announcement. We were also happy to announce the all-new iTunes U App last week, allowing students using iPads to have access to the world's largest catalog of free educational content, along with over 20,000 education apps and hundreds of thousands of books in the iBookstore that can be used in their school curriculum. And as of today, over 3 million copies of iTunes U App have already been downloaded. Combining iPhone, iPad and iPod touch, we surpassed 315 million cumulative iOS device sales, selling more than 62 million in the December quarter. We were very pleased to launch iOS 5 and iCloud during the quarter. Customers are loving the new features of iOS 5, including Notification Center, iMessage and Reminders. And iCloud is off to a great start with more than 85 million customers signed up as of today. With iCloud, customers can store their music and photos and documents and keep their personal information and content in sync across all their devices, automatically and seamlessly. The App Store continues to be incredibly successful with over 550,000 apps available, including 170,000 apps specifically for iPad. We are thrilled that by the end of this month, our developers will have earned over $4 billion cumulatively from App Store sales, including over $700 million in the December quarter alone.  I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, which also generated record results. Revenue was $6.1 billion, an increase of 59% over the prior year. The stores experienced very strong year-over-year growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac sales, establishing new records for all 3. iPhone sales were extremely robust, more than doubling year-over-year thanks primarily to the very successful launch of the iPhone 4S. Sales of iPad were also up significantly year-over-year, thanks to continued strength of iPad 2 and strong holiday season buying. The stores also sold 1.1 million Macs compared to 851,000 in the year-ago quarter. And about half the Macs sold in our stores during the December quarter were to customers who had never owned a Mac before. We opened 4 new stores in the quarter, including our spectacular new store at Grand Central, as well as 3 stores in Europe, bringing us to a total of 361 stores. With an average of 358 stores open, average revenue per store was $17.1 million compared to $12 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 43%. Segment margin reached a new record of over $1.8 billion and 30.3% of retail revenue compared to $1 billion and 26.2% in the year-ago quarter. Store traffic reached new record levels with 110 million visitors compared to 76 million visitors in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 45%. That translates to an average of almost 22,000 visitors per store per week, reflecting incredible interest in our stores and our products. Our EasyPay checkout process has significantly enhanced our ability to handle such high customer traffic levels. And now, with personal pick up, customers can order Macs, iPods or iPads from the Apple online store and pick up most in-stock products within 1 hour at the Apple Retail Store of their choice, making shopping for Apple products that much easier and faster. Total company gross margin was 44.7%, which was 470 basis points higher than our guidance. About half of this difference was driven by lower commodity and other product costs. Another quarter was due to leverage on the higher revenue and some onetime items benefiting the quarter. And the remainder was due to better-than-expected mix largely from the record iPhone sales. Operating expenses were $3.36 billion, and included $357 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $137 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 25.25%. Turning to our cash. Our cash for short-term and long-term marketable securities totaled $97.6 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to $81.6 billion at the end of September quarter, a sequential increase of $16 billion. About $64 billion of the cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter. Cash flow from operations was over $17.5 billion. We are actively discussing uses of our cash balance and don't have anything specific to announce today. In the meantime, we continue to be very disciplined with the cash and are not letting it burn a hole in our pockets. As we move ahead into the March quarter, which will be 13-week quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be about $32.5 billion, compared to $24.7 billion in the March quarter last year. We expect gross margin to be about 42%, reflecting approximately $60 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be about $3.05 billion, including about $350 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $125 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.25%. We are targeting EPS of about $8.50. In closing, we are extremely pleased with customer response to our products and the record-breaking results in the December quarter. We launched iPhone 4S to rave reviews, delivered iOS and iCloud to millions of customers and surpassed all previous records for quarterly iPhone, iPad and Mac sales. We are very proud to be delivering the strongest product lineup in Apple's history and we are extremely enthusiastic about our new product pipeline. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.\nBenjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Tim and Peter, can you describe the iPhone momentum as you ended the quarter? And what is included for the iPhone in your guidance and your enthusiasm for the product as we head into the first half of the calendar year? Any more detail in metrics would be helpful.\nTimothy D. Cook: Sure, Ben. This is Tim. We were thrilled with the 37 million iPhones that we sold. It's up 128% against a market rate of growth of about 40%, according to IDC's latest projection. And this is substantially above the 20 million unit previous record. We would attribute it to a -- just a breathtaking customer reception of the iPhone 4S with iOS 5, and key features such as Siri and this incredible camera with advanced optics. Customers are absolutely loving this product. We also attribute it to -- we made a very bold bet entering the quarter as to what the demand would be. And as it turns out, despite it being a very bold bet, we were short of supply throughout the quarter and did end with a significant backlog as Peter has said. That situation has improved some since the end of the quarter, but we still are short in some key geographies currently. I would also attribute the performance to the delayed purchases from the prior quarter as we discussed in the October call as the -- people were anticipating a new iPhone being announced. I think we made the correct decision to go with a broad range of iPhones. It turned out to be a benefit as we thought it would. And of course, the 14th week, as Peter said, is a part of this, although everyone knew that, as we did as well, and factored that into our guidance. Geographically, we saw strength in literally in every key region. But in particular, I would call out that U.S. and Japan, which got billing early in the quarter and had most sale -- many more sales days than most countries. I would also say that was particularly huge with the iPhone sales in Greater China, particularly considering that we did not launch the iPhone 4S in China until in January. And therefore, had no sales into mainland China during last quarter. And so we could not be happier. We felt we were betting bold, as I think many of you would have thought if you would have known what we were doing. But as it turns out, we didn't bet high enough. Our customers are loving iPhone and we're very happy with that.\nBenjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My follow-up is, as we're doing the math here, it seems like the ASP is up sequentially for the iPhone. So it seems like there was a very good mix of the 4S and the higher capacity 4S, could you just comment a little bit on that versus the iPhone 4 which you cut the price of?\nTimothy D. Cook: The iPhone 4S was the most popular iPhone during the quarter. And consistent with most launches, we typically see a higher mix of the front end of the launch.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just a follow-up on the iPhone discussion. Tim, can you talk about whether the pent-up demand at the end of December and today -- is both countries like U.S. and Japan that had the phone all quarter? Or is it just countries that recently received and are able to sell the phone? So if can you talk about that, and then the second part would be, does the component environment and your production capacity or your suppliers' capacity allow you to start to address that catch-up demand, address China, which is new this quarter, and also help you start to rebuild inventory in March? Or are there any constraints that you see in the near term?\nTimothy D. Cook: I don't want to comment on current sales trends other than -- because we have included, obviously, that in our guidance. But I would -- given that we just launched in China, I would say the demand there has been staggering. We are selling through our reseller stores and our online store. We're not currently selling through a retail store. And the demand is off the charts. And so we're very happy with the demand response there. The other countries that we launched in earlier this quarter were smaller countries in a demand sense. And so we'll see how the quarter goes from a supply-demand point of view. We did make progress as we moved from the end of the quarter until now, as I alluded to earlier, and got caught up in some countries, but there is still some that we are not caught up. So we'll see how we'll do going forward. In terms of the component environment, generally speaking, the component environment is favorable. That was one of the things that allowed us to overachieve on gross margin. And we would predict that, that component environment stays favorable on most key commodities with the exception of hard drives which, as you know, was very much affected by the tragic situation in Thailand. And I don't predict Apple having a material supply issue during the quarter, but we will pay more for drives during the quarter. And that's reflected in our guidance that Peter gave earlier.\nOperator: From Citi, we'll go to Richard Gardner.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: I was actually going to ask about the hard drive situation. I'd love to just get a little bit more detail there in terms of whether it did have any sort of meaningful impact on Mac sales during the December quarter? Tim and -- you mentioned that you expect to pay more for drives. I guess you don't expect it to have any sort of impact on revenue for the March quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, for the December quarter, Rich, there was not a material supply or cost impact to any of our product lines as a result of the -- for the March quarter, we're not expecting any material supply impact. However, in the hard drive area, prices have increased and we have included those cost increases in our guidance that Peter provided earlier.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then for the December quarter, you obviously -- you saw some pretty dramatic declines in key components like NAND, down about 10% and DRAM down almost 40%. Can you talk about, within that context, how favorable you expect pricing to be for some of those key commodities here on the March quarter and whether the overall industry shortage of HDDs is having a material impact on pricing and other categories?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes. Last quarter -- not confirming the percentages that you gave out, but we did receive better costs than we had rolled in our guidance on -- particularly on displays and NAND Flash and DRAM. And we would expect that NAND, DRAM and most LCDs would continue to be in a position that supply exceeds demand for the industry, and therefore those price trends should continue to be favorable in this quarter and we reflected that in our guidance. The big exception is the hard drive, which I pointed out earlier, which is constrained on an industry-wide basis, and where I believe we can navigate the supply issue that we are paying more for them and that's rolled in our guidance.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Rich, it's Peter. I'd like to just talk a little bit about the gross margin guidance to put the component environment in context. We do see that helping us sequentially in the March quarter. But overall, we would anticipate our gross margin to be down by about 270 basis points. And we see that largely coming from the loss of leverage on the sequentially lower revenue on the December to March quarter. The nonrecurrence of onetime items, which benefited us in the December quarter, and the stronger U.S. dollar that we've seen.\nRichard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Since you touched on it, Peter, can you talk about how big the nonrecurring items were as a gross margin benefit in December?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yes. They, along with the leverage, the 2 of those together represented about 1/4 of the upside that you saw to our guidance. About half of it came from better commodity and other product costs, and the remaining quarter came from better mix, largely the iPhone sales.\nOperator: Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.\nBill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Great. I have a question on the iPad. Obviously, a very strong shipment number for the December quarter. But with that said, did you see any impact at all from some of the new lower-priced tablets in the market? And I guess looking forward into 2012, how do you think about competition from the lower-priced content, subsidized tablets like that of Amazon's models in 2012?\nTimothy D. Cook: We're really happy with the 15.4 million iPads that we were able to sell. And as Peter said, we did take down the channel inventory slightly. There's the -- underlying sell through was slightly higher than that. This is consistent with our long-term beliefs that we've had since -- before we introduced the product, that this is a huge opportunity for Apple over time. And as I've said before, I truly believe, and many others in the company believe, that there will come a day that the tablet market and units is larger than the PC market. In fact, it's interesting to note that in the U.S., it's clear from the IDC's recent data on desktop PCs in the U.S., that tablets exceeded desktop PC sales last quarter in the U.S. And so I think you can already see different indicators that there is significant momentum in this space. In terms of our competitiveness, the ecosystem for iPad is in a class by itself. We strongly believed in optimizing applications from day one to take advantage of the larger canvas, and we now have apps totaling over 170,000 available for customers. And that compares to what appears to us to be only a few hundred for the competition. And so I think people really want to do multiple things with their tablets. And therefore, we don't really see these limited function tablets and e-readers being in the same category. There is clearly customers that will buy those. I think they'll sell a fair number of units. But I don't think that people that want an iPad will settle for a limited function. And in terms of other tablets, last year was supposed to be the year of the tablet. I think most people would agree, it was the year of the iPad for the second year in a row. And so we're just going to continue to innovate like crazy in this area. And we think we can continue to compete with anyone that is currently shipping tablets or that might enter in the future.\nBill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. Great. And then, I guess digging into the iPhone number a bit more, you gave us a lot of great color on that performance, but could you dig in a bit more to what your learning in terms of iPhone elasticity with the new price points for the 3GS, I guess in both the post and prepaid markets? And I know in the past, you've talked about the iPhone and the prepaid market that sort of an evolving strategy that you all were approaching with sort of an open mind. How are you thinking about that now that you've had a full quarter with these lower price points and obviously, some success there?\nTimothy D. Cook: Each of the models, the 3GS, the iPhone 4 and the iPhone 4S, were important in achieving the 37 million total units. And so we're glad to cover the broad range with great products. But the iPhone 4S was clearly the most popular among those. In the postpaid markets, as you know, there's a much smaller difference between what the customer pays in each of these. It's larger in the prepaid markets, and so it's too early to tell given we just started this October as to how this will play out over time. But we're thrilled with the total result, and you can bet that we're into details in every single country in the world trying to learn what we can learn to adjust and even do better in the future.\nOperator: From Sanford Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.\nA.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Peter, Tim, I'd like to follow up on your comment that you're actively discussing, uses of cash. Is that any different, quite frankly, than what you've been doing historically? Or is that statement meant to suggest that you're thinking more constructively about cash than you have historically?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Tony, it's Peter. We have always discussed, internally as a management team and with our board, our cash. We recognize that the cash is growing for all the right reasons and I would characterize our discussions today as active about what makes the most sense to do with the cash balance, but we don't have anything to announce specifically today.\nA.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Is there a timeframe or will you actually tell us that you've finished those discussions? Or is there a process for which there is an ending and you will inform us about that?\nPeter Oppenheimer: When we have something to announce, Tony, we will announce it. But I want to say again that we are actively discussing the best uses of our cash balance.\nA.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And then on my follow-up, I was wondering, I want to revisit the gross margin question. I think in each of the last 10 years, your gross margin has actually gone up from Q1 to Q2. I think the last 3 years, which is more representative of your mix, it's kind of been going up by 200 basis points. So by saying it's going to go down 270 basis points, that's kind of bucking normal seasonality by 400 to 500 basis points, sounds like the onetime items is about 50 basis points. Is the loss of leverage that significant? Or what am I missing?\nPeter Oppenheimer: The factors that are -- Tony, that are going to affect our sequential decline are primarily 3. They are the loss of leverage from the revenue, so we reported $46.3 billion this quarter, which included a 14th week. We see our revenues being $32.5 billion next quarter. So against our fixed cost that will have a significant impact. We did have some onetime items in the December quarter which won't recur, and the dollar is much stronger. So those are the principal 3 reasons. I would also say that 44.7 is a high, high, higher than we have seen since I've been with Apple in 15 years. And it's hard to compare this year versus last because we're in different commodity cycles and different currency levels and where we are with our product cycles as well. Last year, we did have a sequential increase in iPhones, and that was a big contributor to our going up sequentially. We don't see that reoccurring this year, especially from the high of $44.7 billion.\nOperator: We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nCharles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: So we just got back from CES and everyone has a connected TV, trying to solve problems that only Apple can solve, and yet when we look at your Apple TV offering, it seems a little dated compared to what's on the market. So just from a high level, how should we be thinking about your strategy in the living room?\nTimothy D. Cook: Gene, it's Tim. The Apple TV product is doing actually very well. In last fiscal year that ended in September, we sold a bit above 2.8 million units. And just in the past quarter, the December quarter, we set a new quarterly record for Apple TV at over 1.4 million. But in the scheme of things, if you dollarize this in revenue that -- we still classify this as a hobby. However, we continue to add things to it and if you're using the latest one, I don't know about you, but I couldn't live without it. And so I think it's a fantastic product. And we continue to pull the string to see where it takes us. But other than that, I don't have any comments.\nA.M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Okay. And then Tim, you've been CEO for 4 months now, and I wonder what your early read on your new job has been. Has anything surprised you? Have you ever come across anything that you didn't expect?\nTimothy D. Cook: I love Apple, and it's just a reminder everyday of how much of a privilege it is to work with a team of people that are so incredible, and how lucky I am.\nCharles Eugene Munster - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division: But from like a strategic standpoint or anything that you can add as far as your first 4 months?\nTimothy D. Cook: No, you can see the -- our results. And I think the team is doing a fantastic job. We feel very good about where we are.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Keith Bachman with the Bank of Montr\u00e9al.\nKeith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Peter, to start with you, when you talked about the cash balances, that you'll announce something when you announce it. But could you give us a little perspective on how at least you're framing the differences, opportunities in terms of dividends and buybacks?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Keith, we're examining all uses of our cash balance, what we might do in the supply chain, what we can do from an acquisition perspective and otherwise. Since I don't have any perspective to share with you today, specifically on dividends or buybacks, other than again, we are actively discussing the cash balance. And in the meantime, we're not letting it burn a hole in our pockets.\nKeith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Tim, then, try one for you. One thing you didn't mention much in your prepared remarks and subsequent questions was discussions around iCloud. And I just wanted to try to get some perspective: a, what's your perception on how it's adding value to Apple's products; and then b, as importantly, what are the metrics that you guys are using to determine if it indeed is driving success surrounding the various products?\nTimothy D. Cook: I think Peter shared earlier the number of customers that had signed up for iCloud, and it's already over 85 million. So it's incredible that this has happened just in -- just a few months, period of time. We're thrilled with it, and the response customers has been incredible. It's solved a lot of problems that customers were having and made their lives incredible, much, much easier. And so I see it as a -- it was a fundamental shift recognizing that people had numerous devices and they wanted the bulk of their content in the cloud, and easily accessible from all the devices. And I think we're seeing the response from that, and with 85 million customers in just 3 months, it is a very, very important part. It's just not a product. It's a strategy for the next decade.\nOperator: That comes from Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I wanted to ask about iPhone distribution in the quarter, and outlook for distribution as we move forward over the next several quarters. Can you give us an update in terms of where you are in distribution for the phone? And in terms of China, what are the prospects for expanding your reach from a carrier standpoint in China over the next couple of quarters?\nTimothy D. Cook: We are now over 130,000 points of sale throughout the world. That's up about 35% on a year-over-year basis. And so we have consistently added points of distribution. That's both adding carriers that have captured distribution, our own distribution as well as key retailers, which are particularly important in some markets. We added carriers last quarter with KDDI in Japan and Sprint in the United States. And both of those carriers, they can speak for their own results, but we are extremely pleased with both companies, and while the incumbents that were in the market also did incredibly well. And in terms of China, China Unicom continues to be a very key partner. I've got nothing to announce today on an expansion there. But as I consistently said, China is an extremely important market for us, and we continue to look at how to grow it further.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Okay. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about your revenue guidance for the March quarter. If you assume kind of weekly sales are adjust for the 14th week, it looks like you're guiding revenue down to about 25% quarter-on-quarter. However, you started the quarter with a pretty significant backlog of iPhones, et cetera, pretty strong momentum. Why would revenue be down more than normal seasonal or just historical seasonal end of March?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Chris, this is Peter, I'll take that. Let me first start with units and then I'll talk about some points on revenue. iPhone, we would expect to have a significant year-over-year increase and be down sequentially, as we reported from the 14-week December quarter. For iPad, we would expect to have a significant year-over-year increase, and also be down sequentially as reported from the 14-week December quarter and the end of the gift-giving season. And for Mac and iPod, we would expect to be down sequentially consistent with our typical seasonality. From a revenue perspective, I completely understand the question that you're asking, and I want to talk to you about 5 reasons why I expect the -- us to be down in greater percent sequentially this year than we were last. The first, the December quarter this year included a 14th week, which was the week between Christmas and New Year's. That week accounted for approximately 1/14 of the December quarter's revenue. Second, that week between Christmas and New Year's, fell within the March quarter last year and it will not be included this year. And sales in that week are typically greater than the average for the weekly sales in the March quarter. So when we think about our March quarter on a sequential basis, we would have loved to add that week in the quarter that we're now heading into. Last year, we increased the iPhone channel inventory by about 1.7 million units in the December quarter, so -- or this March quarter, so that benefited the quarter and reduced the comparable. The fourth, our December quarter results this fiscal year benefited from the launch of the iPhone 4S. We believe there were significant pent-up demand for the iPhone 4S heading into the December quarter, and it's been our fastest iPhone rollout ever. The previous iPhone launch took place at the end of June 2010. So in the year-ago December quarter marked the second full quarter of new iPhone availability. So we have some differences in launch timing. And finally, the U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent weeks, particularly against the euro, and we expect this to have an impact on our sequential compare. Last year, the dollar was relatively flat within the comparable time period. All that being said, we just reported an amazing quarter and we feel very good about the momentum of our business.\nOperator: We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Tim, I had a question -- and actually, Peter, I realize you're not going to talk specifically about cash, but with regard to acquisitions, perhaps you can talk a little bit about your strategy behind some other acquisitions including your most recent one, which was Anobit.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Shannon, we have done acquisitions where it tended be smaller or medium-sized companies that have just great engineering and other talent, a great start on a product or a technology that we'd like to bring in to Apple, and sometimes including the IP. And that's really the acquisitions that we've done. We tend to do several a year. We're very, very disciplined in how we think about this and how we do it. And I think our track record here has been very strong.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: And can you talk a little bit about how they're integrated in? I'm just kind of curious as to -- since there's been several sort of semi-related acquisitions that you've made? I mean, do they sort of become encompassed within Apple or do you run them sort of as standalone divisions?\nTimothy D. Cook: Shannon, we don't believe in lots of divisions like a lot of companies do. So we run the company as one instead of a lot of many companies. The semiconductor team works for Bob Mansfield, as does all of the hardware engineering for the whole company. And so Bob and his team are integrating Anobit into that team. Anobit has fantastic technical talent and we're really fortunate to have them join us.\nOperator: From Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha.\nKulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Both of my questions kind of link to geographic expansion, maybe for Tim. I take the point of your focus in China, but it's also like -- I think if given what you said, you may be at 230 or 235 carriers now. There's about 500 carriers in the world, and I was wondering what your ambitions are and what you think the reality is over the next 12 to 18 months of I think at least a sizable share of them. And I had similar question on geographic expansion, Tim, just in terms of country rollout, you seem to have at least addressed part of China on the retail side, and it sounds like Brazil is next. But when can we look forward, Tim, you maybe addressing markets like India or Russia more aggressively with your retail presence?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, we are today selling in Brazil through online store and reseller partners, including some very key carrier partners. We're selling in Russia through carrier partners and reseller partners. And we're selling in India through some carrier partners and reseller partners. And so we're in all of those countries today. But I've tried to be very clear in the past, and I'll do so again, that we have a ton more energy in the China market today. That doesn't mean that there is a lack of effort or focus on the others. It just means that it's less than what we're investing in China today. On the second country on the list of those 4, for us, would be Brazil. I think there's a huge opportunity for us there, and we've more than begun to go deeper into Brazil. But I don't want to signal that, that means that Apple Retail would be there, because I don't envision that occurring in the near term. In India where it is small, the revenue went up over 3x last quarter, but that's on a small base. And so we're beginning to see traction in most of these, but we recognize we have to focus to deeply understand the point that we can really get to a large revenue figure like Greater China currently is. In terms of more carriers, we have been adding carriers. I anticipate we'll continue to add carriers. We have nothing specific to announce today, but you can bet that we're looking at the same list that you are. In terms of major carriers there, the number is much smaller than the number you quoted, as you know, there is a lot of smaller carriers on there. And the same thing with countries, there's many smaller countries. But all of those are important, I'd like to get into all of them over time.\nOperator: From JPMorgan, we'll go to Mark Moskowitz.\nMark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Tim, I want to come back to the tablet market here. Obviously, the iPhone was scintillating in terms of the growth, but I think the iPad growth also really outpaced a lot of our expectations. And the question really is -- it's kind of a loaded question. The question is really around -- do you think that Apple actually benefited from some of these lower cost, reduced features that tablets come into the market, where folks came in to check them out and realized not really that good, so they trade up to the iPad? And do you see that may be happening as well with the MacBook Air this year? Because this year seems like to be the ultrabook's version of \"Let's try to be like Apple as well.\"\nTimothy D. Cook: Well, I looked at the data, particularly in the U.S. on a weekly basis, after Amazon launched the Kindle Fire. And I wouldn't, in my view, there wasn't an obvious effect on the numbers plus or minus. The theory that you've got, I have heard clearly from some customers that, that occurred, that they went in thinking that they would buy that, they'd look at it and decided to buy an iPad. Whether that's happening on a very, very large basis, I don't know. Again, my own view is looking at our data in the U.S., there was no obvious change in the data, for what it's worth. That's how I see it. There is cannibalization clearly of the Mac by the iPad, but we continue to believe there is much more cannibalization of Windows PCs by the iPad and there's many more of them to cannibalize. And so we love that trend. We think it's great for us. The thing that is very different about the iPad is you can see it beginning to appear virtually everywhere. The enterprise has adopted it in a very large percent of the Fortune 500, as Peter talked about earlier. That number is also quite large when you look at the Global 500. In education, in K-12, we sold twice the number of iPads as we did Macs. And generally speaking, education adopts new technologies fairly slowly, so that's somewhat surprising. And of course, the consumer is -- has moved in a huge way to iPad. And so it's winning market by market, by market. I think that consumers that go in and look at it and think about the ecosystem and the huge advantages and the overall customer experience, I think we will win a fair number of those. And I think you can see that in the results. And so we couldn't be happier with doing over 15 million. And I think it's remarkable that we sold over 55 million iPads, and we've only been in the business April of 2011, I think, when we shipped the first one -- or 2010, excuse me.\nMark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then the other question I have is given your customer data, are you seeing any sort of phenomena now where, because of the accelerated refresh cycles, the widened gap in terms of what Apple has given to the customer base versus the competition's meager efforts, if you will? Are you seeing accelerated refresh rates within your customer base in terms of someone who buys an iPhone, maybe they're buying it quicker or maybe they're also buying now a MacBook Air or an iPad, do you see an accelerated refresh rate or a halo effect?\nTimothy D. Cook: In the enterprise space, we've seen -- as an example, we've seen iPhones sort of being a catalyst. And the iPad moves after the iPhone. And in several accounts, we've seen the Mac follow that. And so there are clear examples where one product has pulled the other. And at a macro level, how much it's happening, it's very difficult to put our fingers on, but many customers, consumers, enterprise, education, they're all pointing that out. And as you know, we've seen that phenomenon before with the halo that the iPod created for the Mac back at the early 2002, 2003, 2004 range. And so it's not a phenomenon that is new to us.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Mike Abramsky with RBC Capital Markets.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Tim, Android versus iPhone. Is this, in your view, becoming a 2-horse race similar to Mac versus Windows? And how do you see the sustainability of your integrated model versus what happened in terms of the growth of the OEM model in the PC market?\nTimothy D. Cook: I wouldn't classify it like Mac and Windows at all. The Mac has outgrown the market for over 20 quarters in a row, but still has a single-digit percentage of the worldwide market, where iOS, if you look at phones and tablets, and the iPod touch, we've sold over 315 million iOS devices. And so I think this compares very favorable to any comparison, and over 62 million of those were done in the last quarter alone. I don't have comparable numbers, Mike, on Android. I haven't found a way to get very crisp quarterly reporting like we do that is straightforward and transparent. However, you can see from a momentum point of view, if you look at the MPD data that just came out a few days ago, it shows in the U.S., and this is just looking at October, November and so this had part of our launch in October and then all of it in November, it shows that just the iPhones, looking at phones not total iOS, it shows iPhone at 43% and Android at 47%. The Nielsen data that just came out a few days ago shows iPhone in the October, November, December timeframe at 45% versus Android at 47%. And the comScore data that also came out on October, November shows iPhone at 42% versus Android at 41%. And so it seems like all of the data that I've seen in the U.S. would say that it's a very close race in iPhone. I think on the iPad side, although I don't have specific numbers to share from third parties, I think that all of us inherently believe that iPad is way ahead there. And there's really no comparable products to the iPod touch out there. And so iOS is doing extremely well. I wouldn't say it's 2-horse race. There's a horse in Redmond that always suits up and always runs, and will keep running. And there's other players that we can never count out. And so what we focus on is innovating and making the world's best products. And we'll just keep on doing that and somewhat ignore how many horses there are. And we just want to stay ahead and be the lead one.\nMike Abramsky - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division: Okay, just as a quick follow-up. There's 2 developments in the market on -- in smartphones that you sort of haven't approached yet, but Android has at least approached, which would be 4G and larger screens. In the past, you've articulated a fairly firm view both on the iPad and the iPhone of display dimensions, for example, you mentioned that earlier in this call in iPad. Has the popularity, for example, of larger screens on Android phones changed or impacted, for example, your view? And same thing on 4G obviously, some of these phones have challenges to battery life, but what are your thoughts there?\nTimothy D. Cook: Well, I wouldn't comment on the future roadmap, I'm sure that's a shock to you. But I would point out that we just sold a record 37 million iPhones. And so I think there's an incredible number of people -- and we could have sold more if we would have had more supply. But there's a lot of people out there that really love what we're doing.\nNancy Paxton: A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks at the Podcast on the iTunes Store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim Cook for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you very much for joining us. We are eager to share with you the results of the final quarter of Apple\u2019s fiscal 2013 with a strong finish to an amazing year and Peter will provide details about the September quarter shortly. But first I\u2019m happy to tell you that Apple\u2019s business is stronger than ever. We are in a unique position of having world class hardware, software and service skills under one road, which enables us to provide an unparallel user experience to 100s of millions of customers. And working with our vibrant developer community, we\u2019ve built a large and thriving ecosystem. We are winning with our products in all the ways that are most important to us, in customer satisfaction, in product usage and in customer loyalty. Our relentless focus on providing innovation that enhances our customer\u2019s lives is evident in extraordinary list of products that we\u2019ve launched in just the last couple of months. From the colorful iPhone 5c and forward thinking iPhone 5s to the powerful new iMac, MacBook Pro and Mac Pro to the stunning iPad Mini with Retina display and the dramatically thinner, lighter and more powerful iPad Air. Thanks to a deep collaboration between our design and engineering teams. We also launched iOS 7 with a stunning new redesign, powerful new features and a great new service called iTunes Radio. We introduced OS X Mavericks bringing new core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance to our Mac and we introduced next generation iLife and iWork apps for iOS and OS X. And we\u2019re making all of this incredible software free because we want our customers to have access to the greatest new features. All of these are products that only Apple could have delivered and most companies would be proud to just have one of them. Looking back, we\u2019re very pleased with Apple\u2019s many accomplishments during fiscal 2013. Our customers had an incredible response to our product line up, buying a 150 million iPhone, 71 million iPads and 16 million Macs across the fiscal year. We expanded the breadth and depth of our ecosystem and we generated over $16 billion revenue from iTunes software and services. We also welcomed almost 400 million visitors to our retail stores and opened or remodeled 49 new stores and for the second year in a row we produced over $50 million in revenue per store. We generated record total company revenue of $171 billion, earnings of $37 billion and operating cash flow of $54 billion. We paid over $8 billion in capital expenditures to both to our supply chain, expand our infrastructure and increased our retail footprint. We also completed 15 strategic acquisitions. That\u2019s an average of one acquisition every three to four weeks. We more than doubled the size of our capital return program to a $100 billion, including the largest share repurchase authorization in history and we become one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In fact, we returned over $36 billion to shareholders to dividend and share repurchases in the last five quarters alone. We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business performance and a return of capital. We review our capital program regularly and our orders engaged in the discussion of capital allocation on an ongoing basis. We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in the past. We greatly appreciated their suggestions and we will actively seek their input again this year. As we\u2019ve in the past, the Board and the Management team will consider a wide range of issues and be thoughtful and deliberate and we will announce any changes to our current program in the first part of the new calendar year. We are off to a great start in fiscal year \u201914. We continue to be very confident in Apple\u2019s future and we see significant opportunities ahead of us and both current product categories and new ones. We are participating in large and growing markets. Today smartphone penetration of the global handset market is only a little over 50%. The smartphone category is expected to grow significantly in the next few years from about 1 billion units per year this year to over 1.7 billion in 2017. And the tablet market is growing at an even faster way from about 225 billion units this year to over 400 million in 2017. We are continuing to invest in R&D and distribution, we\u2019re expanding our geographic coverage and we\u2019re building upon a phenomenal, but still very young retail store presence. We are also proud to be a force for good in the world beyond our products, whether its improving working conditions of the environment, standing up for human rights, helping eliminate AIDS or reinventing education, Apple is making substantial contributions to society. I would like to thank all of our customers and our long-term shareholders for their loyalty and I\u2019d also like to thank Apple\u2019s many talented employees who have worked tirelessly to bring us this far and who are passionately focused on making great products that enrich people\u2019s lives. I\u2019d now turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the most recent quarter. Peter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Tim. We are pleased to report the results of the final quarter of Apple\u2019s fiscal year \u201913 with record four quarter iPhone sales, driving our highest September quarter revenue ever. Revenue for the quarter was $37.5 billion, up $1.5 billion or 4% from the year-ago quarter, and slightly above the high end of the guidance range. Gross margin was 37% at the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was $10 billion, representing 26.8% of revenue. Net income was $7.5 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $8.26. As for the details of the quarter, I would like to begin with iPhone. We sold 33.8 million iPhones compared to 26.9 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of 6.9 million or 26% and a new September quarter record. iPhone sales were ahead of our expectations and grew stronger year-over-year in each of our geographic segments. We were particularly pleased with growth in a number of developing markets with unit sales up sharply year-over-year in Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and India. We were also very happy to add NTT Docomo to our carrier line up in Japan, a country where demand to iPhone has been especially strong. iPhone sales remain very robust in the U.S with comScore estimating that Apple was the leading smartphone manufacture with a 40.7% smartphone subscribership for the three months ending in August. And among North American customers polled by ChangeWave late last month, we plan to purchase the smartphone with a 90 days, 63% indicated they plan to purchase an iPhone. We exited the quarter with about 14.3 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represented a sequential increase of 3.3 million from the June quarter and placed us at the low end of our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look forward basis. Customers are loving their iPhones. Based on the most recently published research, ChangeWave measured a 96% customer satisfaction rate among iPhone users and Kantar measured a 92% customer loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition. And we believe that a great customer experience translates to much higher usage. In fact, Experian reported that iPhone users spend an average of 53% more time each day on their phone than android phone users. iPhone continues to be a key productivity tool for organizations around the world aided by apps from the app store as well as those custom built for internal use. In fact, nearly 35,000 companies representing millions of employees worldwide are building custom apps that address specific workflow improvements with their iPhones and iPad users. In the U.S., over 14,000 employees of Johnson Controls are using iPhones for work. The company has created in-house apps that have enhanced field technician service delivery and customer communications. In China, AVIC International, a unit of Aviation Industry Corporation of China has equipped 27,000 employees with iPhones to access internally developed apps for office, administrative documentation, approval processes in key business intelligent systems. Turning to iPad, we sold 14.1 million iPads during the quarter compared to 14 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sales exceeded our expectations in the September quarter as we approach our new product introductions. We experienced robust year-over-year sales growth in Japan, Russia, the Middle East and we were pleased with strong back-to-school demand for iPad in the U.S. and Canada. iPad sell-through was roughly equal to sell-in, so we exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory within our target range of four to six weeks on a look-back basis. Interest in iPad remains incredibly strong. In an August survey by ChangeWave, consumers who intend to purchase tablets within 90 days, 55% indicated they find the purchase of iPads more than four times the rate of the next most popular alternative. And of those who already own iPads, the survey measured a 99% customer satisfaction rate. The momentum of iOS devices in enterprise also remains incredibly strong. In its latest Mobility Index Report, Good Technology indicated that the iOS platform accounted for 95% of enterprise mobile app activations and 72% of all mobile device activations in the September quarter while iPad accounted for 90% of total tablet activations. Companies around the world are using iPads with custom apps to reinvent their legacy business processes; improving efficiencies across organizations and job sections. For example, direct store delivery reps at Dr Pepper Snapple Group uses iPads to facilitate communications and streamline the product delivery process. East Japan Railway personnel use iPad Minis to stay informed about schedule changes and access conductor manual. And Swedish manufacturer SKS uses a custom iPad app to calculate the life of their ball bearing products saving 10 to 15 minutes per calculation for every engineer several times per day. Schools around the world continue to adopt iPad to transform teaching and learning in the classroom. In the U.K. the number of iPads sold to K-12 schools has more than doubled year-over-year and in Latin America; over 70,000 iPads are being used by systemic learner students [ph] across 800 schools to improve their learning experience. Here in the U.S., school districts continue to rollout large iPad initiatives to students. The Coachella Valley School District in California is currently distributing over 19,000 iPads to its entire student body. In South Carolina every one of the Horry County School District's 10,000 middle school students will receive an iPad this year. These broad deployments are in part driven by the great educational content available on iPad and we're pleased to report that iBooks textbooks are now available across the U.S., U.K. and Australian national high school curricula. Last week we were thrilled to introduce new iPads featuring the A7 chip with 64-bit desktop-class architecture, ultrafast wireless and expanded LTE connectivity. The new iPad Air features a beautiful retina display in an elegant unit body design that is 20% thinner and 28% lighter than the fourth generation iPad and the iPad Mini with retina display packs all the pixels of the iPad Air into its stunning 7.9 inch display and runs over 475,000 iPad apps available in the app store. Turning to Mac, sales with 4.6 million Macs were above our expectations, which is a 7% decline from the year-ago quarter. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 10% during the September quarter indicating that Macs continues to gain share just as they have with 29 of the last 30 quarters. We were especially pleased with strong year-over-year growth in sales of MacBook Air which we updated in June. In late September we updated iMac with fourth generation Intel quad-core processors, new graphics, next generation Wi-Fi and faster PCIe flash storage options. Last week we launched new versions of MacBook Pro with retina display featuring fourth generation Intel core processors, faster graphics, long rate battery life and a more affordable price. Also last week we launched Mavericks, the 10th major release of OS X with more than 200 new features. Mavericks brings iBooks and Maps to the Mac, includes the new version Safari, enhances multi-display support, introduces Finder Tabs and Tags and delivers core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance and is now free. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was just below our four to five week target range. We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and services in the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Our iTunes Stores generated record billings of $4.4 billion in the September quarter thanks to continued strong growth in sales of apps. The quarter's iTunes billings translated quarterly iTunes revenue $2.4 billion, up 15% from the year-ago quarter. The strong iTunes sales combined with other software and service revenue resulted in total quarterly revenue 4.3 billion from iTunes software and services, an increase of 22% year-over-year. Cumulative app downloads have reached 60 billion and our app developers have now earned 13 billion from sales to the App Store, half of which they've earned in the last year. We had a tremendously successful launch of iOS 7 last month with hundreds of millions of downloads in the first few days alone, making it the fastest software upgrade ever. Last week we reported nearly two-thirds of iOS devices were already running iOS 7; that's significantly higher than the percentage of users running the latest versions of other mobile operating systems. This rapid transition to the latest version of iOS not only means that more customers are having the most advanced experience possible but it also enables developers to offer their latest app innovations to hundreds of billions of users in a single software release. iOS offers something now for everyone with its great new design and features such as control center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio. In fact the number of unique listeners who have tried iTunes Radio is now 20 million and growing. iOS 7 also includes significant features that make iPhones and iPads more secure in users to manage in corporate environments, offering new ways to configure and deploy devices at scale. New device management capabilities include control sharing of documents and attachments, App Store license management, wireless managed app setup and streamline mobile device management and enrollment. In terms of security, iOS 7 offers enterprise single sign-on, default third party app data protection and per app VPNs automatically connect stored corporate apps to the network without the need for users to change complicated settings. I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. The revenue for the quarter was 4.5 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. The stores produced very strong iPhone sales with unit growth of 36% per store per week compared to the September quarter last year. W completed the remodels of two stores and opened eight new stores during the quarter ending with a total of 416 stores including 162 outside the United States. We are projecting a total of approximately 30 new store openings in fiscal year '14, about two-thirds of which will be outside U.S. We also plan to remodel about 20 stores over the course of fiscal year '14. With an average of 411 stores opened in the September quarter, average revenue per store was 10.9 million compared to 11.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was 709 million. We hosted 99 million visitors to stores during the quarter which translates to 18,500 visitors per store per week. Operating expenses were 3.8 billion and included 467 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was 113 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 25.9%. Turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with 146.8 billion in cash plus short term and long term marketable securities, a sequential increase of $100 million from the June quarter. Our domestic cash was 35.5 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential decline of 5.2 billion largely attributable to our share repurchase activity. $111.3 billion or 76% of our total cash was offshore at the end of the September quarter, and cash flow from operations was $9.9 billion. We paid $2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter and we executed an additional $5 billion in repurchases up 10.4 million shares of Apple stock during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of $36 billion in payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last five quarters of which share buybacks were $23 billion. This has resulted in cumulative retirement of almost 47 million shares and represents 5% of the total shares outstanding prior to the launch of our repurchase program. More than 44 million of these shares have been retired in the past two quarters alone. Finally given that our capital return program must be funded from domestic cash, and as a result of our payments to date, the cash that we can net domestically and return to shareholders to stop accumulating. In fact we give return to shareholders who invested essentially all of the increase in available net cash generated since the beginning of our capital return program in 2012. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 for common share payable on November 14, 2013 to shareholders of record as in the close of this on November 11, 2013. Now, as we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to in the beginning of the call. First, I was to explain a bit about revenue deferrals. We believe that our software and services play a tremendous role in delivering an overall experience that our customers have come to know and love. Over the last few years we have added significantly to the offering that we provide our customers a no incremental charge from operating system upgrade rights to non-software services such as Siri and iCloud. So, iLife and iWork has become as essential for the user experience as mail, messages and calendar. So we\u2019re now making iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers and Keynotes available as free downloads to customers who purchase new iOS devices and we\u2019re also making Mavericks and future OS X upgrades as well as iLife and iWork free to our Mac customers. As a result of the traditional rights and features we are deferring a greater portion of the sale of each iOS device in Mac sold. We anticipate that the additional deferral per device sold coupled with our sequentially greater unit volume expectations in the December quarter will result in about a $900 million sequential increase in the net amount of revenue deferred for software upgrade rights and non-software services. In total we expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $58 billion compared to $54.5 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 36.5% and 37.5% reflecting approximately a $105 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion including about $585 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.25%. In closing, we are very pleased with the results of the final quarter of our fiscal year \u201913. We enter fiscal year \u201914 with an incredible lineup of products including our amazing new iPhones and iPads. We remain committed to delivering great innovative products and services that delight our customers and enhance their lives, and we\u2019re very confident in our new product pipelines. With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) First we\u2019ll go to Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Peter, I\u2019m a little surprised your December quarter gross margin guidance isn\u2019t even better given the increased total iPhone mix and also iPhone 5s within the iPhone line. I imagine there\u2019s a lot of offsetting factors given the products that were launched last week. So, I just wonder if you can walk through some of the gross margin headwinds that you see in the December quarter.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. We expect, as I said in my prepared remarks our gross margins to be between 36.5% and 37.5%. So, essentially inline with the September quarter we\u2019re pleased to be guiding gross margin about flat sequentially given all the new products that we have launched in the last few weeks. During the quarter we expect gross margin to benefit from the leverage on the substantial sequential increase in revenue. Offsetting these benefits we see a few factors including the higher deferred revenue relating to the software that I talked about in my prepared remarks. And as I said we expect the sequential increase in our deferral which is not only revenue but affects margin as well to be $900 million. Second, a richer mix of new iPad\u2019s with higher cost structures and lower pricing. Third, FX headwinds primarily from the Yen and fourth, the new lower priced MacBook Pro and iMac which have higher cost structures and credit structures. So those are four things that I would point out Katy.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, very helpful. Tim, the press and even some of your competitors are quite complementary of the innovation in iPhone 5s. But it seems like investors are looking or glancing over the 64-bit ARM processor, the fingerprint sensor, the M7 processor and part of this is that they\u2019re not exactly sure what those technologies enable, i.e. why do you need a 64-bit ARM processor in a phone. So, just hoping you could enlighten us a little bit on that question.\nTim Cook: Well, I think everything that you mentioned Katy is the front end of a long road map and so we have the first 64-bit smarphone as you mentioned and this is our first use of the fingerprint sensor and if you\u2019ve used it thus far you know that it's pretty profound to -- use it from a security point of view and use it also to purchase apps or music or movies et cetera. And so, both of these I think are the most important person here obviously is what our customers think and these new innovations on the 5s and the 5c combined led us to have our best iPhone launch ever with selling about nine million units through the weekend. So it was -- we\u2019re off to a great start.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great, thanks. Looking at the iPhone business as well, for the 5c there was some anticipation that the price point would be lower and there was obviously some debate around that when you launched it. Now that you had the device out there for a while, a few weeks; what type of response are you seeing from the most cost sensitive regions and can you remind us of some of the things you are doing to make the products increasingly affordable for the emerging regions in particular?\nTim Cook: Bill, its Tim. If you look at what we\u2019ve done with our iPhone line, we\u2019re selling the iPhone 4s as our entry offer. We\u2019re selling the iPhone 5c as sort of a mid-tier offer and then of course the iPhone 5s. And our goal is to overall have growth worth for total iPhone, but also within that we want to have each of those categories grow as compared to the -- what we were doing previously. And so, if you take look at the total offers that we\u2019re making and low-end space and mid-tier and high-end, the sum of all the price points we offer there we\u2019d like to grow in each one of those and we\u2019re really pleased that we did that, and so that\u2019s how we measure partly measure success, because the most important thing for us is to make a great product, but we do need growth and we\u2019re happy that we\u2019ve seen that. I realize that some people were reading rumors about that the entry phone would be the 5c, but that was never our intent obviously. Our entry iPhone is the iPhone 4s and as you know from comments that I\u2019ve made previously we were selling the iPhone 4 in very good volumes and as we began to experiment in different regions at somewhat lower price points we saw a fair amount of price elasticity and so we\u2019re hoping and thinking that, that will continue with the 4s.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: Okay. And then related to that somewhat looking at the iPhone ASP\u2019s overall, last quarter you reminded us that the iPhone ASP and mix tends to be at its highest levels in the first few months of a product cycle and then tends to trend downward throughout the product cycle. Do you think we should assume similar patterns hold for this cycle or there is some unique factors we should consider particularly given the change in the product line?\nTim Cook: All things being equal what we would normally see on our products is that you have a large number of people that are early adopter related that come into the market right after we announced and buy our very best product. So other things being equal that's what we would expect to see.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nAntonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein: Yes. Thank you. Tim, you commented in your initial remarks about new product categories. I think this was also something you were explicit about in your April quarterly conference call where you said that consumers and investors should expect new products, including new product categories in the second half of this year and first half of 2014. So can you reiterate that we should have that expectation? And when you talk about new product categories, I presume that since you made the statement in April, there have been none? I just want to make sure I understand the semantics of what you referred to as a new category?\nTim Cook: Tony, I didn't say in April that you would see them in this year and the first half of next year just to be clear on that. But what I have said is \u2013 I have said that you would see some exciting new products from us in the fall of this year and across 2014. And I obviously stand by that and you've seen a lot of things over the last couple of months. In terms of new product categories, specifically if you look at the skills that Apple has from hardware, software and services and at incredible app ecosystems, these set of things are very, very unique. I think no one has a set of skills like us and we obviously believe that we can use our skills in building other great products that are in categories that represent areas where we do not participate today. So we're pretty confident about that.\nAntonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. As a follow-up I wanted to revisit the question your pricing strategy. Last quarter you spoke very buoyantly about elasticity that you experienced on the iPhone 4 and you had lowered the price in many emerging markets to about $400. Yet when the new products came out, the 4s was actually at a notably higher price than the 4 had been the previous quarter. The 5c was obviously in line with what we had seen before with the 4s and 5s was in line with the 5. So if anything one of the common themes that came out on last earnings call was the desire to embrace the elasticity of the iPhone, but as best I can tell price points across the board seem to be a little bit higher than they were three months ago despite the significant success you had there. So I'm wondering how we should think about what lessons you learned from the 4 pricing changes, why you didn't choose to keep the 4 given that it was an extraordinary strong seller as best we could tell last quarter and how you proceed \u2013 how you expect to try and continue to address the lower priced segments of the smartphone market?\nTim Cook: Tony, the 400 number just to clarify your number not mine, what we did with our lineup this time was the 4s is replacing the 4 and so if you look at the U.S. as an example, the 4s is now 3, the 4 previously was 3. When you translate that out of the U.S., it depends on the market as to what specifically is happening. As you know currency changes and the strength of the dollar doesn't play in our favor in some geos from that perspective. But generally we see the 4s as our entry iPhone offer that gives somebody the ability to access the entire ecosystem with a fantastic product. And we clearly understand that there is elasticity in that market and we'll move accordingly.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Tony. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll hear from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Hi. Thanks a lot. First question is on China. Tim, congrats on being I think the only company in my sector that grew in China this quarter. I'd have to check that but got to be one of them. You returned to growth I believe at 6%, if my math is right. What happened and do you see that growth rate accelerating? We're hoping you have new partnerships there and how can you expand distribution?\nTim Cook: Yes. Ben we had a pretty good quarter in China. We obviously want to do better. But if you look at the quarter, we did grow by 6%. Underneath that, iPhone units were up 25% year-over-year despite significant constraints on iPhone 5s that affected the whole company [ph]. However, we were able to launch in our first round this time in China and that was a big change in the result of a close work relationship with the carriers in China and the government. And so we feel really good about that. We are able to do that on the iPad as well as we announced last week. For the full year, the Greater China region generated over $27 billion in sales for us, up 14% year-over-year. So we have a reasonable sized business there. In the year-ago quarter, iPad launched. It launched late in China and so that pressure, the 6% down some otherwise it would have been I think even a stronger quarter given the strength of iPhone. So we are continuing to invest in stores. We opened one additional store in Greater China in the last few weeks. We're investing in indirect distribution. Our point-of-sales are up by about 50% year-over-year on the iPhone and we're continuing to go out to more cities. Initially we were very focused on just the large cities and so we're working on both coverage on launching earlier and execution and continuing to build on our retail practice there.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Okay. And I guess nothing to announce more but my second question is for Peter. There's some confusion around the revenue deferral and I was just hoping you could clarify it for gross margins. The $900 million is about \u2013 I don't know I guess 160 basis points if I have that right on gross margins. How much of that should we say is pressuring gross margin down in your guidance? I mean do we take about \u2013 would your gross margin guidance had been about half the difference there higher if it weren't for this revenue deferral? And then when do we recoup that margin? How many quarters does it take to recoup and how will that flow back to the model? Thanks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure, Ben. We have been defying revenues for the sale of each iOS device and Mac given that we have been providing updates to software. Given the announcements that we made last week and that I went through it in my prepared remarks, we have actually increased those deferrals. iPhone and iPad, we are differing between $15 and $25. That's up as much as $5 per device and Mac has been some $20 to $40, so up an additional $20. On a sequential basis, given the increased deferral rates that we have as a result of increase in the software that we are providing to customers for free coupled with our sequential unit increases, we will defer we think about $900 million more in revenue in the December quarter than we deferred in the September quarter. So you can calculate the impact to gross margin on that. We will also and that goes straight through the margin, its revenue and a dollar-for-dollar reduction in gross margin. We will then record that revenue that we\u2019ve deferred for iOS devices across a two year period of time ratably and for Max over a four year period of time. So, Ben just to summarize, we happen to frame revenue on both iOS devices and Max for a number of years given the software that we have been giving away for free. We have increased those rates beginning in September for the iOS devices and in October for the Max, and it will come back into those products over two and four years as I said.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Great, thanks. That\u2019s a pretty good guide for gross margin if you take that out -- if you\u2019re leaving that out. Thanks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Ben, I\u2019d just add on to that, thank you for saying it and I agree; and I would also say that we\u2019re really happy to be guiding gross margin flat not only because of the deferral but in addition to all of the new products that we\u2019ve introduced with higher cost structures and lower prices and we\u2019ll -- no hard and fast commitments, but we\u2019re going to work really hard to get down the cost curves as we have successfully in the past.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we\u2019ll go to Gene Munster.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Hey, good afternoon and just to make sure this is crystal clear here on the gross margin. It would have been about 38.5% would have been the mid point of the guide excluding the change to deferral, is that correct Peter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Probably in that range, Gene. I didn\u2019t do it precisely, but you can take the $900 million that we\u2019re deferring across the revenue range as we did the math.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay, great. And then beyond the December quarter in terms of structural elements around the iPhone gross margin, a couple of years ago with the 4s we saw the launch and then we saw the margins ramp kind of nicely after the launch. I know you\u2019re not giving guidance beyond the December quarter, but are there some structural things that have changed the profitability of the iPhone it would be good to know as we think about our models in 2014.\nPeter Oppenheimer: I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any structural difference\u2019s, but I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and I\u2019m not giving guidance beyond the December quarter but just a couple of things to think about. We\u2019re benefiting this quarter as I talked about in answering Katy\u2019s question from the benefits of leverage given the very big sequential increase in revenue. Leverage cut both ways, so presumably that would go against us in the March quarter. However we would expect to defer less for the software deferrals in the March quarter as well. And as I noted at the end of Ben\u2019s question, we will endeavor to work very hard to get down cost curves as we have in the past, no change.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then my follow-up question, in terms of the iPad and the Mini price change I guess just broader thinking around the iPad we\u2019ve seen some fluctuations in the growth rate. How do you think about that segment in terms of growing at or above or below market growth rates around tablets? And separately is there any differences in terms of how often people are upgrading their iPad\u2019s versus the iPhone\u2019s, it feels like they\u2019re upgrading them every three years versus a little bit over every two years for the iPhone, is that accurate. So, the size of the opportunity and then maybe just any sort of nuances and the upgrade behaviors between the iPhone and the iPad.\nTim Cook: Gene, its Tim. We continue to view the tablet market as huge. We see it as a large opportunity for us. We are not solely focused on unit share as I\u2019ve said many times, but we\u2019re focused on usage in customer\u2019s side, the loyalty and other things that are very important to us. We do believe that this has been or the announcement last week was our largest iPad announcement ever and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to grow year-over-year, and if you look back we had a very, very strong quarter a year ago. We get off to a great start this weekend with iPad Air. And then later in the months we\u2019ll begin shipping the new Mini. We do feel that we wanted to reduce the price of the iPad Mini and so we did that and now we\u2019re coming in at $299 which is an incredible value to get access to the whole of the ecosystem and so forth. And iPad Air is just, it's absolutely incredible product, the best iPad we have ever done. And so, I think all of these are \u2013 [ph] thus these products are going to do really well. I think it\u2019s going to be an iPad Christmas and -- but we will see, we will report the numbers back to you in January how we did, but we are pretty confident.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Cross Research, we will go to Shannon Cross.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit more about your decision to offer the Mac OS for free and provide iWork and iLife with new device purchases? How are you thinking about it vis-\u00e0-vis some of the competition?\nTim Cook: Our primary reason for doing it Shannon was that we wanted it to become a part of what it meant to own a Mac and what it meant to own an iOS device. We saw iWork had become the best selling productivity app on a mobile device. We wanted all of our customers to have access to our very latest software, so they would have access to our best features. And so we decided to make the bold move of making it free and I know some other folks charge a $199 or so for each of these actually for the OS and the productivity apps. But we really wanted to make it a part of the experience and so we are making it free and we are going back all the way to Snow Leopard on the OS side and iWork is free for all new Macs and so I think it\u2019s a very strong offer, I think it\u2019s just another reason that everyone should buy Mac and we think it was great decision to do so, but most importantly we think it\u2019s great for customers.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Great. And then -- I just had a question on education which somewhat ties into this since iWork and iLife I think are some of these operating systems run through that, I\u2019m curious with the -- what your thoughts are with regard to Chromebook Google apps, any kind of foothold that we are seeing with Google taking share in education because as we\u2019ve seen some of the price points for the devices are pretty low, but clearly you guys are able to sell into education as well. So I\u2019m kind of curious as to how you view the competition and how you position your products vis-\u00e0-vis some of the things that are fairly low priced?\nTim Cook: It\u2019s a good question. We had our best education quarter ever. We went over a $1 billion in revenues for the first time ever. We were up strongly year-over-year up 8%. iPad was up 22% year-over-year and the Mac was up 8% and as you know the PC market was down 10% in the aggregate and likely down even more in education. And so we feel like we\u2019re doing great on both fronts, both in the iPad space and in the Mac space for people wanting to buy Mac. And we do see Chromebook\u2019s in some places, but the vast majority of people are buying PC/Mac or an iPad. Our share of tablet in education is 94%. I mean it\u2019s -- yeah, it\u2019s sort of unheard of. I have never seen a market share that high before. So we feel like we are doing really well here and are great to be making -- feel great to be making a contribution to education.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. The next question please.\nOperator: Next from UBS, we will go to Steve Milunovich.\nSteve Milunovich - UBS Securities: Thanks. Could you talk a little bit about the supply side? There has been some thoughts that the fingerprint technology has been a little bit hard to manufacture and you indicated that the Retina mini would be out later in November. So kind of curious, if you\u2019re going to be able to lead the demand for the holidays with the mini that you would like to or may be some general supply comments and also comments on component cost.\nTim Cook: Sure. Steve it\u2019s Tim. In terms of supply, iPhone 5s into the quarter with a very significant backlog. We are still -- we still have a significant backlog. However, our supply is building each week and we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve been -- and we\u2019re very confident of our ability to keep ramping and so we rolled out 30 more countries with the iPhone 5s and 5c as of last Friday and we'll roll out another 16 this week. And so we're right on where we would like to be in terms of achieving 100 countries by the end of the calendar year. In terms of the retina or the iPad Mini with the retina display, we'll start shipping later in November. It's unclear whether we will have enough for the quarter or not. We now have mini \u2013 we will have but you really don't know the demand until after you start shipping and so we'll see how that goes. But I think we'll do fairly well with iPad as I had mentioned before. We felt like it's going to be a really great holiday season. On terms of component cost, both DRAM and NAND were up last quarter from the previous quarter. DRAM we believe will continue to be up in this quarter. We think NAND will be flat and other commodities will fall sequentially.\nSteve Milunovich - UBS Securities: Okay. And then Peter, about a year ago you indicated that the December quarter would benefit by about 200 basis points in gross margin due to a combination of mix shift toward phones and higher volume. Is that the sort of uplift you would expect from those factories this December quarter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Steve, I don't want to put a precise amount on it but we \u2013 I see us benefiting from a couple of things in the quarter; the leverage on the higher revenue by far being the biggest. As Tim mentioned, we expect to have a positive commodity environment and selling iPhones is never a bad thing from the margin perspective.\nSteve Milunovich - UBS Securities: Thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.\nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. The first question for Tim just regarding the channel inventory levels of 14.3 million for the iPhone, much higher than we've seen in the quarters past. Is there similar sort of message there in terms of you not having much broader coverage in terms of incremental coverage or is there a much bigger incremental upgrade cycle from your installed base or both?\nTim Cook: I think the way \u2013 the number one thing to know on the channel inventory is that our range as you know for iPhone is four to six weeks and we were at the low end of our range. And so that to me is the most \u2013 that's the most important thing I look at anyway I should say. You can choose to look at the thing that's most important to you. In terms of a changing from where it's been in the past, the things that you should consider are the \u2013 China was in wave one this year, so there was a lot more point-of-sales there. We added DOCOMO in Japan. And so that's a large carrier to add. And what probably were not in the opening comments was that of the 14 million, 1.8 million of those were iPhones that were in transit and therefore not available to sale in the channel. And we always count those in channel inventory because they are in our sales line. And so that's how I look at the iPhone inventory.\nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Okay. And then just a follow-up, if I could. A year ago you had a very ambitious multi-product ramp in terms of new products coming out. At the same time you did have some impacts related to supply constraints. Just to kind of follow up on Steve's question. Do you feel that four months later, fast forward to the future now that you're in a much better shape to kind of avert or navigate some of these big supply constraints that inflicted some problems on you last year or can we see a similar situation as we move to the quarter?\nTim Cook: As I mentioned on the iPhone 5s I feel like we're doing really well on supply. The demand is very robust. And so we are in backlog right now. But I feel confident about us continuing to ramp and do quite well for the quarter. On the iPad Mini we'll start shipping later this month and it's very difficult to forecast exactly when supply and demand will balance there. We'll also see about the iPad Air as we go out this week. I think we'll have a really good weekend. It may be that not everyone can find what they want more [ph]. I think versus last year I think one key difference is we announced one of our key Macs, the iMac but we didn't begin shipping until the end of December. And so we went for more than two months with minimal iMac sales and therefore from a Mac point of view year-over-year last year, we had \u2013 our only down a quarter, down versus the market that is in the last 30 quarters. And so I don't envision that happening this year. I feel really good about the way the MacBook Pros have gotten off last week. They've gotten off to a huge start. I feel great about Mac growing year-over-year this quarter. I feel great about iPad growing year-over-year this quarter as well. You can tell that from the strong guidance numbers that Peter gave earlier.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Mark. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll go to Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask about iPhone ASPs. They were down about 7% year-on-year in the quarter and down sequentially. Last year they were up sequentially on the launch. Was that a product supply availability issue? And how do you think about ASPs going forward?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Chris, it's Peter. Sequentially we were relatively flat, so I'll comment on a year-over-year basis. They were down 7% as you indicated and this was primarily due to a significant increase in the sales of our entry SKUs where we had made them more affordable to attract more first-time smart buyers. We've also encouraged some FX headwinds from the yen, the Australian dollar and a number of the emerging markets which impacted us as well. I don't want to forecast ASPs for the December quarter. We'll report to you in January what they were. But the FX headwinds will likely continue given where exchange rates are today.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: And just to follow-up on Mark's earlier question around channel inventories, that 14 million unit number was I think higher than a lot of people expected. Was that also SKU-ed [ph] towards the low end of the product stack given the 5s was short exiting the quarter?\nTim Cook: The 5s was in huge backlog and so any kind of 5s that was in the channel was a transitionary kind of move \u2013 maybe perhaps in transit and so forth. We did have as I mentioned before, we had 1.8 million units of total iPhone units in transit at the end of the quarter. So that's a pretty substantial number.\nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank: And just lastly I wanted to ask about subsidies. That wasn't mentioned as a potential impact to phone margins but can you comment on carrier subsidies more generally? How sustainable are they given the competitive environment and how are carriers responding to the pricing stack of your phone line? Thanks a lot.\nPeter Oppenheimer: I think carriers like to sell as many units as they can and get as many people in their service. And in most regions walk into the un-serviced contracts and so they're very predictable and reliable and I don't really see that changing. I think the carriers have come up with some different or some carriers have come up with different sales programs that might appeal to someone who wants to upgrade their phone annually instead of every other year. I think those programs in general probably reduce the subsidy somewhat in the aggregate for people that take these up. But customers may due to such a fair exchange for getting the upgrade more often, so there's a customer proposition for it. Other than that I think we have great relationships with the carriers. I think they were as we were very happy with the iPhone rollout.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Chris.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. We are pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established a new June quarter record for iPhone sales driving Apple\u2019s strongest June quarter revenue ever. Revenue for the quarter was $35.3 billion, up $300 million or 1% from the year ago quarter, and at the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 36.9% also at the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was $9.2 billion representing 26% of revenue. Net income was $6.9 billion translating to the diluted earnings per share of $7.47. Channel inventories declined sequentially by $1 billion during the June quarter this year meaning that sell-through was $36.3 billion. In contrast, channel inventory increased $700 million from the beginning to the end of the June quarter last year meaning that sell-through was $34.3 billion in that quarter. As such, our June quarter sell-through increased by $2 billion, or 6% year-over-year ahead of our 1% [selling and] [ph] revenue growth. As for the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to begin with iPhone. We sold 31.2 million iPhones compared to 26 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 5.2 million, or 20%. We had a sequential decrease of about 600,000 iPhones in channel inventory in the June quarter translating to iPhone sell-through of about 31.8 million units. iPhone sales were ahead of our expectations and we were particularly pleased with very strong year-over-year growth in iPhone sales in a number of both developed and emerging markets including the U.S., UK, Japan, Brazil, Russia, India, Thailand and Singapore. iPhone 5 remains by far the most popular iPhone but we were also happy with sales of iPhone 4 and 4s. We exited the quarter with about 11 million units of total iPhones in channel inventory and ended within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. iPhone unit sales in the U.S. increased 51% compared to the year ago quarter and based on research recently published by comScore, iPhone once again achieved the number one spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the three months period ended in May with over 39% share. iPhone sales were also very strong in Japan growing [66%] [ph] year-over-year. iPhone is the top selling smartphone in Japan based on the latest published quarterly data from IDC and Apple is the number one or number two selling smartphone manufacturer in most markets IDC tracks including North America, Western Europe, Russia, Turkey, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. The most recently published study by Kantar measured at 93% loyalty rate among iPhone owners significantly higher than our competitors. And iPhone continues to lead in terms of customer experience. Not only has iPhone earned the top spot in customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates, an unprecedented nine consecutive times it has also received the top customer satisfaction ranking in a number of surveys including the recent Quality Insights survey of smartphone customers in South Korea. iPhone also continues to be the smartphone of choice for business. Given the security and stability of iOS, enterprise and government customers around the world continue to deploy iPhone on their network in ways that go far beyond personal productivity. Companies have built tens of thousands of custom apps to improve every aspect of their business. Global companies including American Airlines, Cisco, General Electric, Roche and SAP have deployed more than 25,000 iPhones each across their organizations. U.S. government organizations such NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the ATF and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency are supporting and managing thousands of iPhones on their networks and continue to create both customer facing and internal iOS apps. And just this past quarter iOS 6 was granted FIPS 140-2 validation by the U.S. federal government and approval by the U.S. Department of Defense to connect to their networks. Combining sales to business, government and education customers, iPhone holds a 62.5% share of the U.S. commercial market based on the latest quarterly data published by IDC. Turning to iPad we sold 14.6 million iPads during the quarter compared to 17 million in the year ago quarter. The tough year-over-year comparison was driven by both the significant channel inventory increase and the first full quarter of the availability of the third generation iPad in the year ago quarter. We built 1.2 million units of iPad channel inventory in the June quarter last year whereas we reduced channel inventory by 700,000 units in the June quarter this year. Factoring in this 1.9 million unit channel inventory swing, iPad unit sell-through was down 3% year-over-year. We exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks.  Customers continue to love their iPads, for the second consecutive time in the two year history of a survey, iPad ranked number one in the 2013 U.S. tablet satisfaction survey by J.D. Power and Associates and again in its latest study published today [Chitika] [ph] reported that iPad accounted for 84.3% share of tablet web usage by customers in the U.S. and Canada, its highest level this year. In every major industry around the world companies are developing, deploying and supporting apps for iPad. Government organizations as well as global enterprise companies across diverse fields including automotive, insurance, energy services and healthcare are using iPad and custom apps to create unique meaningful experiences for their employees, partners, and customers. The USDA\u2019s National Agricultural Statistics Service has deployed thousands of iPads to in-person interviewers resulting in higher response rates and decreased cost. And companies including Eli Lilly, Novartis, Cathay Life, Roche, and SAP have deployed over 20,000 iPads each across their organizations. Turning to Mac, we are pleased with sales of 3.8 million Macs, which is a 7% decline from the year ago quarter, but higher than our expectations. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 11% during the June quarter, indicating that Macs gained share. In June, we introduced two new versions of MacBook Air and customer response has been great. Wired magazine described the new 13-inch MacBook Air as nearly flawless citing its phenomenal battery life, processing performance, feather-light chassis, and super-fast WiFi. Additionally, last month, we provided a sneak-peek at our next generation Mac Pro engineered around the workstation graphics with dual GPUs, PCI Express-based flash storage, high-performance Thunderbolt 2, next generation Xeon processors, ultra-fast memory and support for 4-K video. The new state-of-the-art Mac Pro will be assembled in the U.S. and will be available later this year. We were excited to release to developer preview of OS X Mavericks last month. More than 200 new features, OS - with more than 200 new features, OS X Mavericks brings Maps and iBooks to the Mac, introduces Finder Tags and Tabs, enhances multi-display support for power users, delivers new core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and performance, and includes an all-new version of Safari. OS X Mavericks will be available to customers in the fall. We ended the quarter with just below our 4 to 5 week target range of Mac channel inventory. Our U.S. education institution business had a great quarter generating its highest quarterly revenue ever. The results were fueled by all-time record quarterly iPad sales of 1.1 million units in addition to strong June quarter Mac sales. The state of Maine\u2019s Learning Technology Initiative, which provides the state\u2019s little school and high school students and teachers with personal computing solutions allowed individual school districts to choose which products to purchase rather than standardized on a single statewide solution. We are very proud that an estimated 94% of the 69,000 total units selected this year were Apple products. And we are extremely pleased to have received the Los Angeles School Board of Education\u2019s unanimous approval to begin the first phase of a massive rollout of iPads to students across the district starting this fall. The district is the second largest in the United States and plans to equip every one of its 660,000 students with a tablet by 2014. We continue to be very pleased with the growth and the strength of the Apple ecosystem. With the broadest geographic reach and depth of content in the industry, our iTunes Stores generated record billings of $4.3 billion in the June quarter culminating in our best months and best week ever for App Store billings at the very end of the quarter. The quarter\u2019s iTunes billings translated to quarterly revenue of $2.4 billion, up 29% from the year ago quarter with strong growth in revenue in both content and apps. The continued strong iTunes sales combined with other software and service revenue resulted in total quarterly revenue of $4 billion from iTunes software and services. We added some great new video content to iTunes and Apple TV. Last month we announced HBO GO and WatchESPN are now available directly on Apple TV joining programming from Hulu Plus, Netflix\u2019s streaming catalog, live sports from MLB, NBA and NHL as well as Internet content from Vimeo, YouTube and Flickr. Sky News, Crunchyroll and Qello are offering live news, sports and current TV programming. Apple TV users can now choose from a broad selection of programming including over 60,000 movies and over 230,000 TV episodes as well as the world\u2019s largest collection of music on the iTunes Store. iTunes users have downloaded more than 1 billion TV episodes and 390 million movies from iTunes to-date, and they are purchasing over 800,000 TV episodes and over 350,000 movies per day. We recently celebrated the five year anniversary of our amazing app store. Our developers have now created more than 900,000 iOS apps including 375,000 apps made for iPad. The popularity of these apps remains incredibly strong. Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 50 billion and app developers have made over $11 billion for their sales through the App Store half of which was earned in the last four quarters. Our vibrant ecosystem continues to drive tremendous user engagement with our devices and services and we now have over 320 million iPod accounts and 240 million Game Center accounts and our customers have sent almost 900 billion iMessages, uploaded over a 125 billion photos and received over 8 trillion push notifications. And thanks to the stability and security and popularity of the iOS platform, the iOS devices continue to have a strong lead over Android in the enterprise. In its most recently published quarterly enterprise device activations report, the technology is found that among its corporate clients iPhone 5 was by far the most frequently updated device of any kind and iPad\u2019s represent 88% of all tablet activations. We\u2019re continuing to invest in software and services to make the ecosystem and user experience even richer. This fall we will release a beta version of iWork for iCloud bringing pages, numbers and keynotes to the web. With iWork for iCloud users will be able to create great looking letters, reports and flyers, generate complex yet beautiful spreadsheets and develop and deliver beautiful presentations with powerful graphics and special effects all from within a web browser. And we\u2019re extremely excited about the fall launch of iOS 7 with its stunning new user interface and many great new features including control center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio, smarter multi-tasking and enhancements to notification center, photos, Safari and Siri. I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, revenue for the quarter was 4.1 billion approximately equal to the year ago quarter. The stores experienced strong growth in iPhone sales and have been most successful MacBook Air launch to-date. We opened six new stores across five countries during the quarter and end of the quarter with a total of 408 stores including a 156 outside of United States. We expect over nine new stores in the September quarter getting us to a total of 27 new store openings in fiscal 13. We also relocated four stores in the June quarter that had outgrown their former space and we expect to complete and total of 23 such relocations in fiscal \u201913. With an average of 405 stores opened in the June average revenue per store was 10.1 million compared to 11.1 million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was 667 million; we hosted 84 million visitors to our stores during the quarter this translates to 16,000 visitors per store per week. Operating expenses were 3.8 billion and included 488 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was 234 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26.9%. And turning to our cash we ended the quarter with a 146.6 billion in cash plus short term and long term marketable securities compared to a 144.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of 1.9 billion. A 106 billion of our total cash was offshored at the end of the June quarter and cash flow from operations with 7.8 billion. In early April we concluded the 1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in December quarter resulted in cumulative retirement of over 4 million shares of Apple stock under that program. In late April we executed a very successful debt offering issuing 17 billion of debt across 3, 5, 10 and 30 year maturities. We paid 2.8 billion in dividends in the quarter and we also utilized a total of 16 billion in cash on share repurchase activity through a combination of a new accelerated share repurchase program and open market purchases. 12 billion of the 16 billion was utilized under a new ASR program initiated with two financial institutions in April. An initial delivery of 23.5 million shares was made under this program with the final number of shares delivered in average price per share to be determined at the conclusion of the program, based on the volume weighted average purchase price of Apple\u2019s stock over the program period, which will conclude in fiscal \u201814. In addition to the new ASR, we executed 4 billion of open market share repurchases, resulting in the retirement of 9 million additional shares. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on August 15, 2013, the shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 12, 2013. Now, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $34 billion and $37 billion compared to $36 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37% reflecting approximately $90 billion related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $3.9 billion and $3.95 billion, including about $495 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%. In closing, we are pleased with our record June quarter iPhone sales, the strong growth in revenue from iTunes software and services, and the continued enhancement and popularity of our tremendously vibrant ecosystem. We are very excited about the upcoming releases of the stunning new iOS 7 in OS X Mavericks, and we are very hard at work on some amazing new products that we will introduce in the fall in across 2014. And with that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please? \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Yes, thanks. Peter, as you mentioned in the press release today, new products will ship this fall, and historically, gross margins do come down in a product transition quarter, but that\u2019s not reflected in your outlook, so can you talk about why this product cycle might be different? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Katy, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect our gross margins to be between 36% and 37%, which is consistent with what we expected in the June quarter. And on a sequential basis, that would mean that gross margin would be largely flat to slightly down. We are on track to have a very busy fall. I would like to leave it there and go into more detail on October. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay. As a follow-up, can you talk about of why you think channel inventory came down more than seasonally this quarter and also inventory on your balance sheet was up significantly, is that a direct result of the channel wanting to hold back inventory? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Katy, I will take the balance sheet part of your question and Tim can talk about the channel. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay. \nPeter Oppenheimer: The inventory on the balance sheet was really up for two reasons. First, we have got more storage this year than we had last. So, our finished goods inventory was a part of the inventory increase and then our components inventory was up as well. \nTim Cook: Katy, it\u2019s Tim. From an iPad point of view, or iPad and iPhone, we reduced inventory, and reduced it fairly significantly. iPad was down over 700,000 units in the beginning of the quarter and iPhone was down over 600. As you know from working with us over several quarters, we typically don\u2019t like to have any more inventory than we need. And so if we can find a way to reduce, we do so. And we have done that in both of these cases. We also have slight decreases in the Macintosh area and on iPod. \nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Okay, thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question please? \nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we will go to Bill Shope. \nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. Thanks. I have a bit of a longer term question. Despite the fairly substantial iPhone upside this quarter, there has been increasing concerns at the high-end of the smartphone markets reaching a saturation point and that growth may be harder to come by for really for all vendors. What\u2019s your perspective on that and the current industry dynamics? And Tim, do you think there are new innovations and services in the pipeline that can reinvigorate the premium segment of the market after what\u2019s obviously been a bit tough 2013 to that segment, to the industry. \nTim Cook: Well from a growth point of view for Apple our key catalysts will be, always will be new products and new services and these are above in existing categories that we\u2019re in and in new categories. In addition to this we have opportunities and distribution from carrier relationships to expanding our retail stores, expanding our online store and continuing to expand the indirect channel and we also have a market expansion opportunity, Peter mentioned enterprise in his comments and the share positions that we have there over 60% in both iPad and iPhone and I think we\u2019re at the very front end of that and so I think we have lots of growth opportunities. And I don't subscribe to the common view that the higher end if you will of the smartphone market is at its peak. I don\u2019t believe that but we will see and we will report our result as we go along. \nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. And then on the iPad side of the equation. Looking at sell through decline this quarter obviously ex the channel inventory dynamics, should we think of this as more of a pause within your customer base ahead of your next refresh as we see in the past or is there a broader industry dynamic at play within tablets that could contribute to that. \nTim Cook: For us if you look year-over-year. We had 2.4 million unit decline but 80% of that or 1.9 million units were just due to changes in channel inventory. As I think Peter referenced earlier, we reduced by over 700 in the current quarter and the year ago quarter had an increase of 1.2 and so the underlying sell through declined by just 3%. If you look at the situation that we\u2019re in in the year ago quarter we had just announced the third-generation iPad which was our first iPad with a retina display. We had announced in March and so that was our first full quarter and so from what Peter and I expected 90 days ago we hit within the midpoint of the range that we expected to hit on iPad unit sales and so it was not a surprise to us. In terms of how other people are doing, I don't know. What I can tell you is that most recent data I have gotten which actually just came out I believe this morning is that the iPad Web share data shows that through the quarter we accelerated further and are now, iPad accounts for 84% of the web traffic from tablets which is absolutely incredible and so if there are lots of other tablets selling I don't know what they are being used for because that\u2019s a pretty, the basic function is web browser. We feel really good about where we are. Peter had mentioned earlier we had an incredible quarter in U.S. education setting a new record for iPad. We\u2019re really happy to be selected for the first phase of 660,000 unit roll out at LA Unified and really bold move they are making to change teaching and learning and we had double-digit unit growth in China, for iPad in Japan, in Canada, in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle East and in India and so we\u2019re really happy with what we saw. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks Bill. Can we have the next question please? \nOperator: From Sanford Bernstein, we will go to Toni Sacconaghi. \nAntonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein: I was wondering if you could provide some kind of gross margin bridge sequentially, I think last quarter you had about a 90 basis point one time impact from the China warranty accrual. So if we adjust for that gross margins were down about a 150 basis points sequentially, and the mix of products was relatively similar to last quarter given that you\u2019re also riding the experience curve in these products, I was surprised given the mix that gross margins were as down as much sequentially as they were. Can you provide a bridge on a sequential basis on what happened with gross margins? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. First of all, let me say, we are very pleased with gross margin in the quarter at 36.9%. It was at really the high end of the range that we provided of 36% to 37%. And the sequential decline was not a surprise to us. We understood the warranty effects in March. And as I said on last quarter\u2019s call, we expect that our margins to be down sequentially primarily for two reasons. The first is the lower sequential revenue, so we lost leverage going from March to June, and we expected a different product mix. And as you can see, we reported very near the top end of that and feel good. \nAntonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein: Right, but Peter, the mix ultimately was not that different I think iPhones were 52.5% last quarter, they were 51.5%. So, it actually seems like your mix was perhaps better than you had anticipated. So, I appreciate the volume revenue mix, but was your mix exactly in line with what you expected? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Well we had some puts and takes within the quarter, but it was \u2013 it ultimately ended up within the range that we thought it would be and we hit the high end. \nAntonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein: Okay. The second one I was wondering whether you could comment on was just iPhone ASPs, they were down about 5% sequentially or down about 10% over the last two quarters. I presume that\u2019s principally due to a higher mix of 4s and 4Ss, but I was wondering if you could comment on what\u2019s driving that change in ASP and whether it\u2019s more pronounced in certain geographies versus others? \nPeter Oppenheimer: We were down 4% year-over-year on the iPhone ASP about $27, and that was primarily due to the mix of the products that we are selling and FX headwinds. As we anticipated iPhone 4 sales accelerated as we offered more affordable pricing in emerging and other markets, so that\u2019s on a year-over-year basis. And then sequentially, it was down about $32, and again, that was driven by mix as well in part iPhone 4. Tim, do you want make comments about what we may have seen in the regions? \nTim Cook: Yes, sure. From an iPhone point of view, Toni, with the moves that we made on 4 and with iPhone 5 continuing to be the most popular model we saw very strong sales in several of the emerging markets or prepaid markets. India was up over 400%. Turkey and Poland were both up over 60%. The Philippines were up about 140%. And in addition, we saw very strong iPhone sales in several of the developed markets. For example, the U.S. was up over 50%, Japan up over 60%, the UK about 50%, and so we had several regions, where iPhone growth actually accelerated from the previous quarter, which is a unusual pattern for us and we were very, very happy with this. \nAntonio Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein: And notably absent from that list was China, was that was your pricing how you treated to change pricing this quarter relative to previous quarters any different in China than the rest of the world? \nTim Cook: China was weaker in the quarter, although the datasheet that obviously focuses on revenue doesn\u2019t really tell the complete story here. If you look at sell-through as we have mentioned earlier with the inventory changes, it\u2019s important to do that. And so our sell-through in China was only down 4% from the year ago quarter when you normalized for channel inventory. Hong Kong was actually down more significantly. Mainland China was actually up year-over-year. It was up 5%, but that is the lower growth rate than we have been seeing and are attributed to many things including the economy there clearly doesn\u2019t help us or nor others. In Hong Kong, Hong Kong is an international shopping haven as you know for not only tourist but also some resellers and we saw more dramatic downturn there, it's not totally clear exactly what had occurred but it was down on a sell through basis by about 20% so that weighed greater China down as you can see in your data sheet. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you Tony. Can we have the next question please? \nOperator: Ben Reitzes with Barclays. \nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: The question that I wanted ask was with regard to, there's been a lot of talk about a trade-in program that you guys are going to start even doing on your own with regard iPhone\u2019s, is there any update on that, and if so is that something that could help margins and help expand your emerging market sales and how is that going to work? Thanks. \nTim Cook:\n : \nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Are you opposed to it? \nTim Cook: No I\u2019m not opposed to it. I see channels doing it and I like the environmental aspect of it and so that part of it really is encouraging today. \nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Okay, then really quick on China you answered some of it in the question before but how do we turn it around here, China and other APAC, what can we do to make it turn, you know there has been some press in China that obviously you had to deal with and when do we see that market turning and even though investors are worried about it from a secular point of view as well as the economy there. \nTim Cook: I think it's important to put in perspective. If you combine the stores (ph) that we have in Greater China our revenues there were 4.9 billion for the quarter and so that 14% powered the company which is very significant and in a few years that was in 100s of millions and so we have run our business there significantly. We have a very strong market there and in the last 12 months we have done 27 billion on a trailing basis and so it's a huge business for us. Underlying the results are, if you look at iPad sell through in greater China was up 8% but the sell through in Mainland China was up 37% and so iPad is doing remarkably well. The latest share numbers we have seen on iPad for the tablet market is over 50% and year-to-date iPad units are up 48% year-over-year and so there have been direct growth there. From an ecosystem point of view we continue to attract a lot of developers from China. We now have about a 0.5 million developers in China that are working on iOS apps and that\u2019s up almost 70% year-over-year and so I think that\u2019s in top economy (ph) for China but for outside of China is many offered their apps through, in different stores around the world. We\u2019re obviously paying the developers quite a bit and so that\u2019s furthering advancement of the ecosystem of developers. We\u2019re continuing to invest in distribution, we\u2019re going to double the number of retail stores there for the next two years and we\u2019re continuing to lift iPhone point of sales and iPad sales both of which are currently lower than where we would them or need them today but we\u2019re doing that very cautiously with what we want to do with great quality. And so I continue to believe that in the arc of time here, China is a huge opportunity for Apple and I don\u2019t get discouraged over a 90-day cycle that can have economic factors and other things in it. \nBen Reitzes - Barclays Capital: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks Ben. Can we have the next question please? \nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we will hear from Gene Munster. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Good afternoon. You talked about more affordable pricing and Peter, can you just confirm that, that was just with the iPhone 4 and then separately as you think about the growth that you had in some of these emerging markets, it sounds like some more recently it has come from affordable pricing, but also you potentially could address those markets in products that are more appropriate for those markets? And maybe can you just talk from a very high level just how you think about, are those both levers that you potentially could use or do you feel that pricing is the lever? And then a follow-up question. \nTim Cook: Gene, it\u2019s Tim. The reference that Peter made earlier was to the iPhone 4 and what we have seen is that the number of first-time smartphone buyers that the iPhone 4 is attracting is very, very impressive. And we want to attract as many of these buyers as we can. And we saw that beginning to happen towards the end of the Q2 timeframe as I have referenced on last quarter\u2019s call and we did that on a wider spread basis offered the more affordable pricing on a wider scale basis this quarter and continued to be very happy with what we saw and where iPhone 5 continues to be the most popular iPhone by far, we are really happy to provide an incredible high-quality product with iPhone 4 running iOS 6 to as many first-time smartphone buyers as we can. And I think it\u2019s proven to be exactly a great product for that buyer. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Do you think there are more weapons that you could use in these markets to continue the pace that you have? \nTim Cook: There is always more weapons. And we have more than one tool in the toolbox, but yes, it\u2019s a great way for a buyer to get into the iOS ecosystem and the customer set ratings that we have with iOS 6 and the stickiness of the platform is huge. And so it\u2019s great for customers and we are very glad to offer it. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. And then my final question is just in terms of the growth question that some investors have about how you keep such a higher revenue growth number moving, last quarter you referred to new products emerging and this time you referred to more products over the next few years. Are there product categories out there that are big enough to move the needle for Apple? \nTim Cook: We will see, Gene. We are working on some stuff that we are really proud of and we will see how it does, and we will announce things when we are ready. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks Gene. \nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Thank you. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Can we have the next question please? \nOperator: From Cross Research we will go to Shannon Cross. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thank you. Tim, can you talk broadly about your discussions with both existing and potential carrier partners, I would think that 56% growth in Japan might prod one in particular to be interested in some of the coming product? And then also there has been some comments about Russia and just concerns in general about pricing in that, so how sort of in general have your discussions with your carrier partners been? \nTim Cook: I would classify them as being good. The processing on Russia probably needs some color. The articles I have seen suggested that we are not selling iPhone through carrier owned stores. If that\u2019s the one that you are referencing if you look at the Russian market, over 80% of smartphones are sold in retail. They are outside of carrier-owned stores and we sell through a number of national chains there, and in fact, our activations in Russia for iPhones were set of record last quarter, is our highest quarter in Russia ever. And so we are really happy with now we\u2019re doing there. We do continue to sell through some carrier on stores as well but obviously the contribution is much less than the retail organizations and so forth and so I think that's probably not well understood there. We\u2019re continually looking for other relationships to both add and enhance the once we have got and I do think there are some opportunities there for us. \nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay great and then can you talk a bit about commodities just in terms of pricing of some of your key commodity\u2019s ability to procure them and how some of, I guess your supply chain is working these days. \nTim Cook: We certainly have no problem procuring. In terms of where we see pricing headed and this would have been factored into the most fortune guys (ph) appear a bit earlier. Despite the very, very weak PC market DRAM pricing has actually increased and we see continued upper pressure in this area. NAND pricing is fairly stable and it's following seasonal trends as we would expect, both LCDs and HDDs have, the prices have fallen and we would expect further reductions in these areas and if you look at other commodities they appear to be in supply for an imbalance and so we would expect the pricing to decline on these sort of historical levels. \nNancy Paxton: Thanks Shannon. Can we have the next question please? \nOperator: From UBS, we will go to Steve Milunovich. \nSteve Milunovich - UBS Securities: Thank you. Peter first could you clarify whether in your fiscal fourth quarter guidance you have any of these new products assume shipping in the quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer: Steve that\u2019s nothing something that I can comment on. \nSteve Milunovich - UBS Securities: Okay and then Tim kind of a philosophical question, but whenever you talk about what\u2019s important in the company it always comes back to great products, better, be more important than more, Wall-Street is kind of in the more business. So I just wonder kind of talk about your philosophy and if you can come up with a couple of really great products maybe they will provide enough growth, maybe they don\u2019t but you don\u2019t seem as focused on kind of financial metrics and growth projections as a lot of companies are. Maybe tie (ph) that a little bit in your functional organizations, does that limit how many products you can actually take to market overtime? \nTim Cook: Steve I think about it as differently than that, the way I think about is, we\u2019re here to make great products and we think that if we focus on that and do that really, really well that the financial metrics will also come and so we don\u2019t see those two things being mutually exclusive. We see them having great overlap and I think if you look at how the company has executed over many years you would suggest that that\u2019s possible. \nSteve Milunovich - UBS Securities: But you don\u2019t go into saying we need to X% percent growth, what do we need to do from a product. It sounds like you go the opposite, what are some really great products we can do and if we do that, the metric will take care of itself. \nTim Cook: We started the product because we believe that the most important saying is that our customers love the products and want them, if you don\u2019t start at that level you can wind up creating things that people don\u2019t want. So we try very hard to focus on products and customers, enriching customers and making great products. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you Steve. Can we have the next question please? \nOperator: And we will go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Just to Bill\u2019s earlier question, Bill Shope\u2019s on you don\u2019t think the high-end is saturated and yet ASPs have come down quite a bit of iPhone\u2019s. I was wondering if you could philosophically is the current mix what we should be thinking about for iPhone\u2019s and more specifically would you anticipate that ASPs would continue to trend lower in iPhone\u2019s or stay where they are at least directionally? \nTim Cook: Keith in terms, we don\u2019t project ASPs, we do give guidance and we have an assumption of the ASP for the current quarter in our guidance obviously to come up with the numbers that Peter talked about earlier. If you look underneath the iPhone numbers, I think Peter alluded to earlier, we saw significant growth clearly in the lower price point year-over-year which for us is iPhone 4, it's still a great product. And that was one of the things and the iPhone 5 doing well that allows us to significantly beat what I think is probably the vast majority of expectations out there for iPhone sales. And so I don\u2019t think we do a lot better at the low end and where we sell more of those in the mix change that it has changed across the last year. If you look at 3GS last year, which was in a comparable position as our entry product, we are selling a lot more 4s and 3GSs, I think we both understand the market much better and have our things on the pulse of distribution in different countries and so forth this year. I am sure that we will get better and better at that over time and how that will change mix, I don\u2019t know. Typically, for us, a product has the highest mix during its initial few months of sales, and so you have a natural kind of seasonal decline over time of a product cycle that generally happens on iPhone, it generally happens on iPad, and we have seen it happen on the Mac over many years. And so I don\u2019t see anything that fundamentally would change that, but again, we are going to look at this thing quarter-by-quarter and tell you how we look at the quarter and give you guidance forward as we go. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay, alright. And then Peter for you, there has been a few comments on gross margins and I want to try to broaden out a bit. In the past as you look at the one quarter forward which would be the September quarter you have given us some of the puts and takes that think about there has been a couple of specific questions asked about, but I want to broaden out and see if you could just highlight what you think are the puts and takes in the September quarter as you see them today, particularly with reference to the quarter you just reported? Thank you. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. I am going to keep my comments limited, but I will give you a put and a take. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Where I guess the tailwind we would expect our component costs to be favorable in the quarter. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay. \nPeter Oppenheimer: Conversely, we would expect some FX pressure in the quarter given the strengthening in the dollar, particularly against the yen. \nKeith Bachman - Bank of Montreal: Okay, thanks guys. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Can we have the next question please? \nOperator: And from Raymond James we will hear from Tavis McCourt. \nTavis McCourt - Raymond James: Thanks for taking my question. Peter, first a clarification on the share buyback and can you tell us what the ending basic share count was in the third quarter? \nPeter Oppenheimer: All of that is on the income statement, so you got the ending basic and diluted, but let me give you a couple of points that I think could be helpful for you. During the June quarter, we concluded the first $2 billion ASR program that we started in December and then so we got the final shares in on those, and we did our second ASR program of $12 billion, that started at the end of April and we received 23.5 million shares initially on that. And I went through in my prepared remarks, at some point during fiscal \u201814 that program will close and we will get the final number of shares. We also bought back 4 billion of stock in the open market during the June quarter and received about 9 million shares. So, the impact of those in the June quarter lowered our diluted share count in the quarter by about 22.9 million shares. And as you look forward into the September quarter before any further buybacks or any issuance to employees we would expect to see an additional approximate 11 million share benefit from the things that occurred during the June quarter. \nTavis McCourt - Raymond James: Great, thanks. And one for you Tim, one of the comments out of the developers\u2019 conference was iOS, hopefully, I guess in 12 different car manufacturer models next year. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about that opportunity whether it\u2019s a license opportunity, what\u2019s the strategic relevance of that if you are willing to? Thanks. \nTim Cook: I am sorry I couldn\u2019t hear that question. \nTavis McCourt - Raymond James:  I think at the developers conference there was a comment about iOS being built into a number of car manufacturing models for next year? I was wondering if you can talk about kind of the strategic relevance for that and what the business model might be for that for Apple? \nTim Cook: I see it is very important. It is a part of the ecosystem, and so just like the app store is a key part of the ecosystem and iTunes and all other content are key and the services we provide from messaging to and (inaudible) support. Having something in the automobile is very, very important, it's something that people want and I think that Apple can do this in a unique way better than anyone else. So it's a key focus for us. \nNancy Paxton: Thank you Tavis.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim Cook for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook:  Thanks, Nancy. Hello everyone, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot of news to share with you today about the details of our March quarter as well as a significant increase to our capital return program. First, I would like to talk about our business and the road ahead. We are now half way through our fiscal 2013, and we\u2019ve accomplished a tremendous amount. We\u2019ve introduced and ramped production of an unprecedented number of new products, and we\u2019ve set many new sales records. Our revenue for the first half was over $98 billion and our net income was over $22 billion. During that time, we sold 85 million iPhones and 42 million iPads. These are very, very large numbers, unimaginable even to us just a few years ago. Despite producing results that met or beat our guidance as we have done consistently, we know they didn't meet everyone's expectations, and though we\u2019ve achieved incredible scale and financial success, we acknowledge that our growth rate has slowed and our margins have decreased from the exceptionally high level we experienced in 2012.\n : These compares are made further challenging until we anniversary the launch of the iPad mini, which as you know, we strategically priced at a lower margin. As Peter will discuss, we are guiding to flat revenues year over year for the June quarter along with a slight sequential decline in gross margins. The decline in Apple\u2019s stock price over the last couple of quarters has been very frustrating to all of us. But Apple remains very strong and we will continue to do what we do best. We can\u2019t control items such as exchange rates and world economies and even certain cost pressures, but the most important objective for Apple will always be creating innovative products and that is directly within our control. We will continue to focus on the long-term, and we remain very optimistic about our future. We are participating on large and growing markets. We see great opportunities in front of us, particularly given the long-term prospects of the smartphone and tablet market, the strength of our incredible ecosystem, which we plan to continue to augment with new services, our plans for expanded distribution, and the potential of exciting new product categories. Take the smartphone market for example, IDC estimates that this market will double between 2012 and 2016 to an incredible 1.4 billion units annually, and Gartner estimates that the tablet market is growing at an even faster rate from 125 million units in 2012 to a projected 375 million by 2016. Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software, and services that we can\u2019t wait to introduce this fall and throughout 2014. We continue to be very confident in our future product plans. Apple has many distinct and unique advantages as the only company in the industry with world-class skills in hardware, software, and services. We have the strongest ecosystem in the industry with App Stores in 155 countries, iTunes music stores in 119 countries, hundreds of millions of iCloud users around the world, and most importantly, the highest loyalty and customer satisfaction rates in the business. And of course, we have a tremendous culture of innovation with a relentless focus on making the world\u2019s best products that change people\u2019s lives. This is the same culture and company that brought the world the iPhone and the iPad, and we\u2019ve got a lot more surprises in the works. A little over a year ago, we announced a plan to return $45 billion to shareholders over three years. Since we began paying dividends last August and began share buybacks last October, we\u2019ve already returned $10 billion under that program. We continue to generate cash in excess of our needs to operate the business, invest in our future, and maintain flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities. We remain firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both our business performance and return of capital. So today, we are announcing an aggressive plan that more than doubles the size of the capital return program we announced last year to a total of $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015. The vast majority of our incremental cash return will be in the form of share repurchases. As the Board and management team deliberated among the various alternatives to returning cash, we concluded that investing in Apple was the best. In addition to the share repurchases, we are increasing our current dividend by 15% to further appeal to investors seeking yield. And as part of our updated program, we will access the debt markets. Peter will provide more details about all of this in a moment. We appreciate the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us on how best to deploy our cash. We will review our cash allocation strategy each year, and we will continue to invest confidently in the business to bring great new products to market, strategically deploy capital in our supply chain, our retail stores and our infrastructure, and make acquisitions to expand our capabilities. We will be disciplined in what we do, but we will not underinvest. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Peter to discuss the details of the March quarter. Peter?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Tim. We are pleased to report the results of our second fiscal quarter. We established new March quarter records for iPhone and iPad sales and new all-time record for iTunes sales, leading to Apple\u2019s strongest March quarter revenue ever. Revenue for the quarter was $43.6 billion compared to $39.2 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of $4.4 billion or 11% and $600 million over the high end of our guidance range. The year-over-year revenue increase was fueled primarily by strong growth in iPad and iTunes sales as well as continued strong revenue from iPhone and Mac. Operating margin was $12.6 billion, representing 28.8% of revenue. Net income was $9.5 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $10.09. As for the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to begin with iPhone. We sold 37.4 million iPhones compared to 35.1 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of over 2.3 million or 7%. We ended the quarter with about 11.6 million total iPhones in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1 million iPhones and we ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Based on research published earlier this month by comScore, iPhones garnered the number one spot in the U.S. smartphone market for the three-month period ended in February with 39% share, up from 35% in the previous survey period. And in Japan, IDC Japan announced that iPhone gained the number one position for all of calendar year 2012 as well as for calendar Q4 2012 in both handsets and smartphones. This is also the first time a non-Japanese company has achieved the number one spot for an entire year. In addition, Apple was ranked number one in Nikkei\u2019s 2013 Japan Brand Survey, achieving the top spot for the second year in a row, which is unprecedented for a non-Japanese company. Around the world, based on its latest published estimates, IDC ranked iPhone number one or two in smarphone sales in over half the countries IDC tracks. A recent study by Kantar measured 95% loyalty rate among iPhone owners, substantially higher than the competition, and iPhone remains top in customer experience. Last month, we were very pleased to receive the number one ranking in smartphone customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates for the ninth consecutive time. Businesses around the world continue to scale iPhone across their workforces. Globally, nearly 30,000 companies are developing and distributing iOS apps for corporate use by their employees. Cisco\u2019s Bring Your Own Device program across 80 countries has resulted in a 50% increase in the number of iPhones connecting to its corporate network in the past year. GlaxoSmithKline has developed more than 50 in-house iOS apps to support the thousands of iPhones and iPads connecting to its corporate network. Other companies such as AXA, Nordstrom\u2019s, Eaton Corporation, and Takeda Pharmaceuticals are supporting thousands of iPhones, and are continually adding new in-house apps to better serve customers and help employees work more efficiently. Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 19.5 million iPads during the quarter compared to 11.8 million in the year ago quarter, that\u2019s an increase of 7.7 million units or 65%. iPad experienced very strong year-over-year growth in every operating segment, particularly in Greater China and Japan where sales more than doubled year over year. Both iPad and iPad mini continue to be extremely popular, and we were pleased with sales of both. We were able to sell significantly more iPad minis in the March quarter than in the December launch quarter and to expand availability to China. Customers love the combination of experience, performance, and size that iPad mini offers, and our early market research indicates that the overwhelming majority of iPad mini purchasers are first-time iPad customers. We ended the quarter with about 4.8 million iPads in channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 1.4 million. All of the sequential increase was attributable to iPad mini. As we discussed previously, we were not able to meet demand for iPad mini in the December quarter and entered the March quarter below our target range of channel inventory. This sequential increase places us within our target range of four to six weeks of total iPad channel inventory. The most recent survey published by ChangeWave indicated a 96% satisfaction rate among iPad customers. Not only is iPad a huge hit among consumers, but it also continues to be widely adopted by business customers as well. iPad and the iOS ecosystem are driving innovation across industries and in companies large and small. We are delighted by the number of companies that are choosing iPad for their most important business tasks as well as the rapid adoption of iPad in emerging countries around the world. Doctors at the Columbia Cardiovascular Foundation in South America are using an in-house app to perform remote diagnostics for patients in inaccessible parts of the country. First National Bank, the oldest bank in South Africa has issued iPads to wealth managers to help enhance customer relationships and interactions. And in the education market, Grupo Santillana has developed UNO Internacional and integrated educational system that uses iPads to create digital learning environment in more than 700 private K-12 schools in Latin America. UNO Internacionalhas deployed more than 60,000 iPads to schools in Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil including 17,000 iPads for teachers and students in Brazil in the March quarter alone. Turning to Mac, we sold just under 4 million Macs, which is a 2% decline from the year-ago quarter. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 14% during the March quarter. We experienced strong year-over-year growth in desktop sales following the December quarter launch of our stunning new iMacs, offset by a decline in portable sales given a weaker personal computer market overall. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range in Mac channel inventory. Moving to iPod, we sold 5.6 million iPods compared to 7.7 million in the year ago quarter. iPod Touch continued to account for over half of all iPods sold during the March quarter. iPod\u2019s share of U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the March quarter based on the latest data published by NPD, and iPod continues to be the top-selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GfK. The Apple ecosystem continues to grow and thrive and we believe it\u2019s a very important driver of our incredibly strong customer satisfaction and retention, as well as developer interest and success. This Sunday marks the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the distribution of digital content. Today, our iTunes store offer the broadest combination of geographic reach in content depth in the industry, and they surpassed quarterly billings of $4 billion for the first time ever in the March quarter, that\u2019s a $16 billion annual run rate making our digital content stores the largest in the world. The quarter\u2019s iTunes billings translated to record quarterly iTunes revenue of $2.4 billion, up 28% from the year ago March quarter with new quarterly revenue records for music, movies, and apps. The strong iTunes sales in addition to other service revenue helped us achieve for the first time more than $4 billion in combined quarterly revenue from iTunes, software, and services. We are thrilled with the growth of these revenue streams. Today, we have music stores in 119 countries offering a combined catalog of 35 million songs. We sell movies in 109 countries offering 60,000 titles, and we have iBookstores in 155 countries offering 1.75 million iBooks for sale, and with App Stores in 155 countries that encompass almost 90% of the world\u2019s population, our developers have created more than 850,000 iOS apps, including 350,000 apps made for iPad. Cumulative app downloads have surpassed 45 billion and app developers have made over $9 billion for their sales through the App Store, including $4.5 billion in the most recent four quarters alone. Canalys estimate the sales from our App Store accounted for 74% of all app sales worldwide in the March quarter. We believe this is in large part due to the great development environment, broad distribution, large and active user base, and seamless integration that the iOS platform offers. Developer such as Backflip Studios have seen explosive growth in their business, thanks to the success of their apps on the iOS platform. With 70 people, this company maintains a growing suite of titles that has seen over 275 million downloads equating to nearly 5 million daily active users and 34 million monthly active users. With annual App Store sales approaching $100 million, Backflip\u2019s iOS sales comprised approximately 95% of the company\u2019s revenues in 2012. Another tremendous success story is Supercell, founded in 2010. Based in Finland, Supercell\u2019s Hey Day and Clash of Clans titles available only on iOS have been the top most in iPad games in over 60 countries helping the company generate $8.5 million in revenue per employee in 2012. And in the enterprise, iOS devices have a strong lead over Android. In its most recently published quarterly enterprise device activations report, Good Technologies found iOS devices accounted for 77% of all activations by its corporate customers. And thanks to careful App Store curation for the quality of apps, the iOS platform offers a much more secure environment. Recent research by McAfee Labs found that 97% of identified mobile malware was on the Android platform, with the remainder primarily on the Symbian and Java ME platforms. But perhaps the most important measure of the success of our ecosystem is how engaged our customers are with our products and services.\n : I\u2019d now like to turn to the Apple Retail Stores. Revenue for the quarter was $5.2 billion compared to $4.4 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%. This growth was fueled primarily by strong sales of iPhone and iPad. We ended the quarter with a total of 402 stores, including a 151 outside the United States. We expect to open about 30 new stores in total in fiscal 2013 and to complete at least 20 store remodels. With an average of 401 stores open in the March quarter, average revenue per store was $13.1 million, compared to $12.2 million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.1 billion. We hosted 91 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to 85 million in the year-ago quarter. That translates the 17,500 visitors per store per week. Total company gross margin was 37.5%, which was at the low end of our guidance range of 37.5% to 38.5%. Operating expenses were $3.8 billion and included $488 million in stock based compensation expense. OI&E was $347 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%\n : As Tim discussed, we are pleased to announce that we are more than doubling our return of capital program to $100 billion by the end of calendar year 2015, which translates to an average of about $30 billion per year. We will continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases, and cash used to net-share-settle vesting RSUs. To facilitate our program, we will access the debt markets. Let me provide more details regarding the three key elements of our plan. First, our Board has increased the share buyback authorization to $60 billion from the original $10 billion announced last year, that\u2019s a $50 billion increase. This is the largest share buyback authorization of any company in history. We are very confident in Apple\u2019s future and believe so strongly that repurchasing our shares represents an attractive use of our capital that we have dedicated a vast majority of the increase in our capital return program to share repurchases. We will buy shares under this authorization beginning this month. We will also continue to net-share-settle employee RSUs as they vest, and expect to use about $1 billion of cash annually to do this. Second, we are increasing our quarterly dividend from $2.65 to $3.05 per share, a 15% increase. We plan to review our quarterly dividend payment annually. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on May 16, 2013, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 13, 2013. We are very proud that Apple is among the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 billion. Third, we will access the U.S. debt markets over time and have recently secured credit ratings from S&P and Moody\u2019s. We are continuing to generate significant cash offshore and repatriating this cash would result in significant tax consequences under current U.S. tax law. Incorporating debt into our capital structure will provide several benefits including access to attractively priced capital, a reduction in our overall cost of capital and an efficient leverage of our very strong balance sheet. We expect to fund the capital return program from existing domestic cash, future cash generated in the U.S., and from borrowing in the U.S. We will maintain sufficient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute capital expenditures and acquisitions. The program announced today will result in returning an average of $30 billion annually to shareholders. To put this in perspective, the $30 billion would have represented substantially all of our fiscal year 2012 fully tax free cash flow had we repatriated our foreign earnings. Between now and the end of calendar year 2015, we would expect both our foreign cash and our domestic borrowing to grow. We will continue to review each element of our capital return program on an annual basis. In conclusion, our capital return program is designed to facilitate our objective of delivering attractive returns to our shareholders on an efficient basis, while maintaining the flexibility to invest in the incredible opportunities that we continue to see for our business. Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $33.5 billion and $35.5 billion compared to $35 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 36% and 37% reflecting approximately $90 billion related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between $3.85 billion and $3.95 billion including about $500 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. In closing, we are pleased with our record March quarter revenue and record March quarter iPhone and iPad sales. We\u2019re very proud of the breadth and depth of our tremendous ecosystem and our new all-time record for iTunes sales. We are also in the fortunate position to be able to more than double our return of capital program to $100 billion with the larger share repurchase authorization in history and to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world with annual payments of about $11 billion. We remain very confident in our product pipeline. With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) First we\u2019ll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Peter, given gross margin did come in at the low end of guidance this quarter and you\u2019re looking for another downtick in June, can you just rank for us the biggest factors that are limiting the margin recovery even as I assume costs are coming down to the new products? And then, I have a follow-up.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Sure. In the March quarter, our gross margin was 37.5%. It was at the low end of our range. We had a few items that on balance resulted in us reporting at the low end. They included mix, in particular, selling more iPads than we had planned, including getting iPad mini into our four- to six-week channel inventory range, some changes in our service policies that required us to make provisions for prior quarter sales, and we had some unfavorable adjustments. As I look forward to the June quarter, we\u2019re guiding gross margin to be down between 50 basis points and 150 basis points sequentially. We see two factors impacting gross margin sequentially. First and the largest of the two is the loss of leverage on sequentially lower revenue; and second, a different product mix. We expect both of these headwinds to be partially offset by better cost in the quarter.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you, and Tim, question for you on China. Growth did slow in that market to single digits this quarter, curious of your perspective as to whether Apple is hitting a wall given you don\u2019t have the largest carrier formally selling your products? And just any thoughts around the stickiness of customers in China given you don\u2019t have an iTunes store there, and data shows that they download fewer apps than in developed countries? Thanks.\nTim Cook:  Katy, thanks for the question. We actually had our best quarter ever in Greater China. So it was a record for us. The revenue came in at $8.8 billion. That includes our retail stores that are in that region that is up 11% year on year, again that includes the retail stores that are in that region, which is the same as Apple is growing. The highlights for the quarter in China were that iPads grew 138% year-on-year, and we set new records for sell-through both for iPhone and iPad during the quarter. There were some significant year-over-year timing differences with regard to channel inventory relative to iPhone that affected the compares year-over-year. In particular, in the year-ago quarter, we increased iPhone channel inventories globally by $2.6 billion, as you probably recall, $1.6 billion of $2.6 billion occurred in Greater China to support the launches that were in the March quarter of last year. And so, if you look at revenue on a sell-through basis, our Greater China revenue was actually up approximately 18%. And so it\u2019s a bit better than it first looked. As I said, in the year-ago quarter, we launched the iPhone 4S with China Unicom in January and we launched China Telecom in March; this year, the iPhone 5 launched in December. and so it\u2019s a very different set of dynamics on a year-on-year basis. Going forward, we still see a significant opportunity in China, it\u2019s a great market. We have 11 stores there. we expect to double those in less than two years. We have added about 8,000 iPhone point-of-sales in the indirect channel to about 19,000 today and we obviously have a plan to add more and further grow our distribution, December is obviously too low currently. We\u2019re also innovating in our online, with our online store there in adding different functionality to the store. China has a unusually large number of potential first-time smartphone buyers, and that\u2019s not lost on us. We\u2019ve seen a significant interest in iPhone 4 there and have recently made it even more affordable to make it even more attractive to those first-time buyers. and so we\u2019re hopeful that will help iPhone sales in the future.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we\u2019ll go to Bill Shope.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thanks. Tim, you mentioned several factors that were compressing growth in gross margins in recent quarters in this year. but can you comment a bit more on the competitive landscape in 2013 versus 2012? how has it surprised you, and what do you think the company needs to do to reinvigorate your share gains across your key product categories?\nTim Cook: Bill, I think the smartphone market has always been competitive. The names have been changed. the names of competitors have changed. In the beginning, RIM was sort of the very strongest player, because the smartphone as you know really got going into the enterprise area. And of course, today, our tough competitor from a hardware point of view would be Samsung and married to Google on the operating system side. They are obviously tough competitors, but we feel that we have the best products by far. And we are continuing to invest in innovative products and feel really, really confident about our product pipeline in both hardware, software and also our services. We have the best ecosystem by far, and we\u2019re just going to keep augmenting it, and making it better and better. and that shows up in both our royalty ratings and our customer stat and I feel very good about our competitive position.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: One more question if I may. Can you comment on how you\u2019re thinking about the pace of your buyback program and what factors are you going to consider to determine purchase timing over the next few years?\nPeter Oppenheimer:  Sure, Bill, it\u2019s Peter, I\u2019ll take that. We\u2019re going to begin buying shares under the authorization beginning this month. And we expect to utilize the remaining $58 billion under the authorization by the end of calendar year 2015, which spans 32 months from now. We expect to use accelerated share repurchase programs and to buy in the open market.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Bill. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From UBS, we\u2019ll go to Steve Milunovich.\nSteven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC:  Thank you very much. Tim, you alluded to fall announcements of products, is that indicating that there may not be substantial new products until literally fall late September, which means the September quarter could look a lot like the June quarter, is that part of what are implying or were you just being more general?\nTim Cook: I don\u2019t want to be more specific, but I\u2019m just saying we\u2019ve got some really great stuff coming in the fall and across all of 2014.\nSteven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then could you talk a bit about the supply chain, there has been some concern with some of the product limitations late last year, I mean it\u2019s got to be getting so huge relatively to what you used to run. But what\u2019s your confidence level in the supply chain particularly as you\u2019re potentially moving to new types of vendors over time as the units continue to increase?\nTim Cook: I have incredible confidence. We exited the March quarter with no shortages while achieving inventory turns of over 90, which is still to this day is staggering for our industry. The December quarter that you\u2019re referring to was the largest quarter ever in the history of Apple and the technology industry as a whole. And as you know, it included for us a number of new products and unprecedented number and of new product ramps. The reality is the work we do to produce truly innovative products is very hard and there has always been challenges that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll face some in the future. However, I would assure you that we are working very closely with our manufacturing partners to execute what we feel is a very exciting roadmap.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Steve. Can we have next question please?\nOperator: From Sanford Bernstein, we\u2019ll go to Toni Sacconaghi.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. I wanted to revisit the gross margin question. and specifically, I was hoping you could comment on whether you feel you\u2019re experiencing that the normal kinds of experience curves or declining cost curves that you do in typical product ramps. And whether you could comment on the sequential decline in iPhone ASPs, which were down nearly $30 sequentially, I presume that reflects a mix of 4 and 4S relative to the 5. But perhaps, you can confirm that in what its impact might have on gross margins and how we should think about that? and I have a follow-up please.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Yeah. Toni, it\u2019s Peter, I\u2019ll take your first two. We\u2019re very pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making on getting down cost curves and this will help to partially offset the loss of leverage and the different product mix that we expect to see in the June quarter and we have factored these cost improvements into the guidance we\u2019re providing for the quarter. The iPhone ASPs were down sequentially about $28 as you noted. And this was driven primarily by mix. The largest factors were an increase in the iPhone 4 mix, which resulted from or making the iPhone 4 more affordable in many markets. And also mix within the iPhone 5 as it was in its second full quarter.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And its impact on margins, how do we think about relative margins for 4 relative to 5 on balance?\nPeter Oppenheimer: Toni, we don\u2019t provide margins by product or within product line. But I talked about two factors that were impacting gross margin on a sequential basis. The first is leveraging, that\u2019s largest of the two on the lower sequential revenue. But we also expect to see a different product mix and that\u2019s primarily related to iPhone.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then\u2026\nTim Cook: Toni, just one other point on that is, as you get further, we see this on most of our product line, as you get further from a previous product launch, there is a general within a line, a general lower mix than where it starts. And so you\u2019d expect, all things being equal, you\u2019d expect to see that on most of our products.\nToni M. Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Tim, I wanted to follow-up with you on a statement you made in a previous response. You talked earlier about how you are excited about the large addressable markets that you have particularly, the smartphone and tablet marketplaces. And you talked about how strongly and confidently, you feel about competitive advantages in your products and ecosystems. If I step back and look at the data for this quarter on the phone side, if I adjust for inventory, the iPhone was up very low to mid single digits. I think most third-party market data would say that the smartphone market probably grew about 30%. And if I look broadly incorporating your guidance for next quarter and thinking about fiscal Q1, it appears very unlikely that Apple will grow at that market rate of 30% or more. So I am wondering if you could comment on a) whether that [extent of the] [ph] loss in market share is something that is \u2013 Apple has focused on or cares about as a principle financial objective? And if so, why do you think there is this disconnect between the very attractive products that you are offering and the market data that I just cited?\nTim Cook: So, Toni, let me try to address, you mentioned both smartphones and tablets and so let me try to address both of those. First let me start with the tablet side, the numbers that we\u2019ve seen from IDC would indicate that they believe the market in March declined by 30% from December, December being obviously seasonally high quarter with a holiday. As you can see from our numbers, we declined 15%. And so if that holds, we did much better than the market and had a very nice pick up in market share. And, obviously, on iPad, we continue to have an ecosystem story that is unparalleled, we have 350,000 apps that are optimized for iPad versus a few hundred for our competition and the overall experience in the fit and finish of the product, I think, we agree is substantially better than the options there. On the phone side, the numbers that you talked about, the sell-in comparisons year-over \u2013year, you really have to convert that to sell-through to look at the underlying demand. And as I\u2019ve gone through before, we did grow channel inventory in the year ago quarter because we were catching up on the roll out of the iPhone 4S, in fact, we grew by 2.6 million. And so you have to factor in to get at the real sell-through. However, I take your point if the market did grow by 30%, we still, after that normalization, we grew less than that. And so I think the question or the \u2013 this point is not lost and we do want to grow faster. We don\u2019t view it, however, as the only measure of our health. The things that are very important to us in addition to market share and unit volumes include things like customer stat, which were the highest by far winning J.D. Power\u2019s nine times consecutively and the customer loyalty and repurchase rates, which were the highest by far the 95% according to Kantar. And the ecosystem commerce, which attracts developers is incredible, Canalys says that we have 74%, so basically $3 out of $4 that are spent on apps are spent in our ecosystem. And if you then looked at usage statistics, they are staggering at the usage of iOS versus other operating systems. And so market shares are important and unit volumes are important, but these other things for us are extremely important, because we are all about customer experience and enriching lives. Now, that said, we see an enormous number of first time smartphone buyers coming to market, particularly, in certain countries around the world. And so what we\u2019ve done with that is and we started last quarter is we\u2019ve made the iPhone 4 even more affordable and which has made it more attractive to first time buyers and we caught up on the \u2013 our supply - demand towards the late in the quarter last quarter and we are continuing to do that in other markets. And we believe that the phone or the price point that we are offering is an incredible value for people, that allows them to get into the ecosystem with a really, really, phenomenal product.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Tony. The next question please.\nOperator: From Barclays we\u2019ll go to Ben Reitzes.\nBen A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Tim and Peter, can you comment on gross margin beyond next quarter maybe what does it say about long-term gross margins if 36 to 37 is the margin that you are calling for when your highest margin product, let\u2019s hope is that a trough for the year and I think you are implying that when you say all these new products are coming in the fall. So is there an implied margin philosophy here with this 2Q guide that 36 is as low as you wanted to get and then maybe it gets better from there or is there nothing that we should imply in terms of how the company views gross margins?\nPeter Oppenheimer:  Ben, it\u2019s Peter. I\u2019ll start on that one. It\u2019s been our long-term practice, we\u2019re not providing specific gross margin guidance beyond the June quarter. We don\u2019t do this, because there are many factors that can influence gross margins and a specific quarter and cause them to vary widely over time, including product cycles, commodity markets, product mix, and currencies. So while we don\u2019t want to make a forecast beyond June, let me tell you how we think about gross margin and hopefully this will help. We are managing the business for the long-term and are willing to trade off short-term profit where we see long-term potential. The iPod is a great example of this. When we launched it in 2001, its margins were significantly below the margins of Apple at that time. Four years later, the iPod and the iTunes Music Store comprised half of Apple\u2019s revenues and inspired us to build the iPhone. The iPad mini is another great example. We have priced it aggressively and its margins are significantly below the corporate average. However, we believe deeply in the long-term potential of the tablet market and think that we\u2019ve made a great strategic decision. We\u2019ll only make great products and this precludes us from making cheap products that don\u2019t deliver a great experience. We believe deeply that there are people in every part of the world that want great products. Looking back over the last several years, we\u2019ve made very good business decisions balancing units, revenues, and the bottom line. We think about all three and as I said, we\u2019re willing to make short-term trade-offs and profits, where we see long-term potential. And we\u2019re managing Apple with a very long-term horizon. Some of our revenues and profits occur after we ship our products. We were thrilled to exceed this quarter $4 billion in revenue for our services for the first time. And as Tim mentioned, we will augment our very strong ecosystem with new services and make the current ones even, even better. So we remain very confident in our strategy and we will use our world-class skills in engineering and operations to manage our business well in the future.\nBen A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right, thanks. And Tim, my follow-up just for you, just maybe asking you this every quarter in different ways. But I just wanted to get your reaction to what you thought of the 5-inch phone market at this time versus three months ago? And if anything has changed in your view as to that market and its place in the smartphone world versus your 4-inch product? And that\u2019s it from me.\nTim Cook: Yeah Ben, that\u2019s a good question. My view continues to be that iPhone 5 has the absolute best display in the industry. And we always strive to create the very best display for our customers. And some customers value large screen size, others value also other factors such as resolution, color quality, white balance, brightness, reflectivity, screen longevity, power consumption, portability, compatibility with apps and many things. Our competitors had made some significant trade-offs in many of these areas in order to ship a larger display, we would not ship a larger display iPhone while these trade-offs exist. \nBen A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it.\nTim Cook: Does that answer?\nBen A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nBen A. Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, got it.\nNancy Paxton:  Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene E. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.: Hey, good afternoon. Tim, I just wanted to confirm, did you mention in your prepared remarks that something about new product categories or did I not hear you correctly?\nTim Cook: I did, Gene. I said that one of our areas for growth are potential new categories, and we\u2019re very excited about those.\nGene E. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.: And that would presumably be kind of in the next year?\nTim Cook:  Well, I didn\u2019t announce the specific timeframe, but\u2026\nGene E. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.: Okay. And Peter, you mentioned new services in that you can kind of build and kind of improve on existing services, and I guess, beyond just the natural evolution of maybe Maps and iCloud, are there any other kind of key assets that you guys have which you can leverage in the new services?\nPeter Oppenheimer:  Well, nothing specific, Gene, but we are very fortunate to have the largest and broadest ecosystem in the world. We have App Stores in 155 countries and iTunes Stores in over 110 countries. We have hundreds of millions of users. we\u2019ve just crossed a $16 billion run rate on the iTunes Stores in terms of billings, and just achieved for the first time $4 billion in revenue for our services. So we\u2019re really thrilled with what we\u2019ve just reported this quarter, but we see opportunity that we\u2019re going to invest in tremendously to delight our customers and continue to grow our business in those areas.\nTim Cook: \n :\nGene E. Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.: \n :\nTim Cook:  I think it\u2019s in its infancy, Gene. I think it\u2019s just getting started and just out of the starting block.\nNancy Paxton: \n.:\nOperator: From Cross Research, we\u2019ll go to Shannon Cross\nShannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much. Tim, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what you\u2019re thinking about within the Mac market and PC market because obviously you outperformed substantially the competition but we\u2019re still down about 2%. So I am curious as to whether or not you think elasticity of demand with lower prices or what you are hearing from your customers in terms of their reluctance to buy a new Mac and then also how you\u2019re thinking about the cannibalization potential that\u2019s coming out of the iPad?\nTim Cook: I think the, Shannon, I think the reason that we were down last quarter, we were down 2% as you had mentioned. The market for PCs are incredibly weak. IDC said that the market for the March quarter was down 14% year-on-year, which is the largest decline that I remember from being in this industry for a long time. At the same time, we sold almost 20 million iPads and it\u2019s certainly true that some of those iPads cannibalized some Macs. I personally don\u2019t think it was a huge number, but do I think it\u2019s some, and I think probably the larger thing at least for the, maybe not so much on the Macs side, but on the PC side, it\u2019s cheaper, probably extending their upgrade cycles. That said, I don\u2019t think this market is a dead market or bad market by any means. I think it has a lot of life to it. We are going to continue to innovate in it. We believe that if anything the huge growth in tablets may wind up benefiting the Mac, because it pushes people to think about the product they\u2019re buying in a different manner and people maybe even more willing to buy a Mac where today than may be buying a PC. And so we\u2019re going to continue making the best personal computers. our strategy is not changing. And we feel really good about it. We delivered some incredible innovation last year with Retina display with the MacBook Pro, an incredible thin and light package and we\u2019ve got some more great stuff plan. So this is an area we\u2019re continuing to invest in.\nShannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC: Okay. And just a follow-up question with regard to the tablet market. We\u2019ve met with some of your competitors recently and they\u2019re starting to talk about wins in the enterprise, and touting the benefits of Microsoft and some of the other OS\u2019s that are out there in terms of security and interoperability in some of the enterprise companies. So I\u2019m curious what you\u2019ve heard from your customers, have you seen much displacement and what are sort of the discussions that you have with enterprise customers with regard to iPads and fitting into their systems? Thanks.\nTim Cook: We seem to be doing really well and Peter had referenced earlier, the Good Technology\u2019s data that says that iOS accounted for 77% of all their activations by their corporate customers. Now that would not include BlackBerry, but it would include all the other guys. and so we seem to be doing really well and honestly, I don\u2019t see the recent announcements changing that at all. I\u2019ve seen more and more people developing more and more custom apps for their businesses on iOS to be used on iPad and we\u2019re very, very bullish on it. As a matter of fact, just to quote you some numbers, iPad now is being used in 95% of the Fortune 500 and what\u2019s even more impressive probably is on the global 500 companies, we\u2019re now in 89%.\nShannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.\nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC:\n :\nTim Cook:\n :\nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And then my follow-up question is back to the ecosystem. Are there other metrics or milepost you can share with us, you acknowledged earlier that the growth of revenue at Apple have slowed for some of your key products. But how about the ecosystem in terms of usage rates, are you seeing slowing there or are you actually seeing the opposite where there\u2019s maybe acceleration within each user?\nTim Cook: We see incredible usage in every study that we see. These aren\u2019t just done by us, as a matter of fact the vast majority of them come from other people. The usage of iOS devices are staggering compared to others. It\u2019s a phenomenal difference. And I think that shows the strength of the ecosystem.\nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.\nPeter Oppenheimer: And Mark this is Peter. I will add that, we are now paying very happily our developers more than $1 billion every quarter.\nMark A. Moskowitz \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Mark.

We\u2019re very pleased to report the results of Apple\u2019s first fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales, significantly broadened our eco-system and generated Apple\u2019s highest quarterly revenue and net income ever. Revenue for the quarter was 54.5 billion compared to 46.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 8.2 billion year-over-year. As a remainder our first quarter this fiscal year spanned 13 weeks whereas the first quarter last year included a 14th week. As such average weekly revenue was 4.2 billion in the current year quarter compared to 3.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 27%. The strong year-over-year growth was fuelled by record iPhone, iPad and iTune sales.Operating margin was 17.2 billion representing 31.6% of revenue. Net income was a record 13.1 billion just ahead of the amount generated in last year\u2019s 14 week quarter and translated to diluted earnings per share of $13.81. Beginning this fiscal year we\u2019re reorganizing the presentation of our results to provide greater transparency. First, we\u2019ve established a new operating segment of Greater China given the very significant contribution of that region to our overall business. We define Greater China to include Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Second, for segment reporting purposes we\u2019re allocating certain manufacturing cost and variances including cost related to product tooling and manufacturing process equipment to our operating segments instead of including these expenditures in corporate expenses as we have done in the past.We have recast our operating income for each quarter in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to reflect this change and have provided a reconciliation on Apple.com/Investor. These changes have no impact in overall reported operating income. And third, we have realigned the presentation of product information in our summary data schedule to provide greater visibility to revenue by product category. Under this new format revenue from iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod sales is presented exclusive of related service and accessory revenue. All revenue from iTunes, stand-alone Apple and third party software and services is presented as a single line item and revenue from all Apple and third party accessory sales is presented as a single line item. We believe this presentation provides a logical grouping of revenue sources and also provides greater transparency into our results. As for the details of this quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 47.8 million iPhones compared to 37 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of over 10 million iPhones.This represents a rate of almost 3.7 million iPhones per week in the current year quarter compared to 2.6 million per week in the year ago quarter. That\u2019s an average increase of 39% per week consistent with IDC\u2019s latest published forecast for the global smartphone market in the December quarter.And on a sequential basis iPhone sales grew 78% over the September quarter\u2019s results. That\u2019s over 3.5 times IDC\u2019s latest published projection for sequential growth of the overall market resulting in iPhone market share growth. We experienced strong iPhone growth in each of our geographic segments most notably Greater China where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the U.S. Kantar Worldpanel Comtech estimates that iPhone shares of smartphones sales increased from 45% in the year ago quarter to over 51% in the current year quarter.iPhone sales were driven by the tremendous popularity of iPhone 5 which we\u2019re extremely proud to have launched in 100 countries by the end of December resulting in the fastest iPhone rollout ever. We ended the quarter with about 10.6 million iPhones in channel inventory a sequential increase of about 1.5 million iPhones and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look forward basis. While other mobile devices and operating systems faced increasing security risks and fragmented inconsistent user experiences, iPhone and iOS continued to deliver an exceptional experience that people love.They also provide a secure and trusted eco-system that IT departments require. iPhone continues to be embraced by government agencies and businesses across the globe. Many U.S. government agencies are issuing iPhones by the 1000s as part of their new mobile strategies. Some examples include NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration.We are also seeing continued iPhone growth in business across the board from companies replacing existing smartphone deployments to businesses adding first-time smartphone users. Companies around the world like Neiman Marcus, Skanska, and Volvo are issuing iPhones to their employees to improve interactions with customers and give workers access to essential corporate data.Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 22.9 million iPads during the quarter compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to over 1.7 million iPads per week in the current year quarter compared to 1.1 million per week in the year ago quarter, an average increase of 60% per week, ahead of IDC\u2019s latest published estimate of 56% growth for the tablet market. Customers are loving the fourth generation iPad with its faster performance and spectacular Retina display. And the iPad mini has been a tremendous hit offering the full iPad experience in an incredible design that you can hold in one hand.In addition to the tremendous response from consumers, iPad continues to be the tablet of choice for businesses and government agencies transforming the way their employees work. Financial institutions like Barclays, Nomura Securities, and Bank of Beijing are deploying iPad to enable employees to better service customers and work securely with financial portfolios and products. In particular, Barclays roll out of over 8000 iPads has generated tremendous employee engagement and feedback making it the most successful IT deployment in Barclays\u2019 history. State and local governments in the United States are also rapidly adopting iPad. Court systems, county inspectors, and law enforcement agencies use iPad to streamline processes and replace huge amounts of paper. And state legislatures in Virginia, Texas, and West Virginia are all using iPads to give lawmakers instant access to government documents and information.Outside the U.S., 10,000 iPads are being deployed as part of broad adoption of a local government workflow solution in Sweden and over 5,000 iPads have been purchased by the government in the Netherlands for the Dutch Tax Authority and the Dutch Court System. We began and ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory. That left us below our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis.Turning to Mac, we sold 4.1 million units in the quarter compared to 5.2 million in the year ago quarter. IDC estimates the global personal computer market contracted by 6% during the December quarter. We introduced the new 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina display as well as our stunning new iMacs in October. As we projected a quarter ago, we were significantly constrained with respect to the new iMacs and were only able to ship them for the final month of the December quarter. We believe our Mac sales would have been much higher absent those constraints. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look-forward basis, which is below our target range of four to five weeks.Moving to iPod, we sold 12.7 million iPods compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. iPod touch was a popular item in the holiday season and continues to account for over of half of all iPods sold during the December quarter. iPod\u2019s share of U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the December quarter based on the latest data published by MPD and iPod continued to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.iTunes generated record results with revenue of $2.1 billion in the quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for revenue from music, from movies, and from apps. We significantly expanded the footprint of our ecosystem during the quarter adding iTunes music stores in 56 countries, including Russia, Turkey, India and South Africa. That brings us to a total of 119 countries, where customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download.The App Store had a record-breaking December quarter with over 2 billion downloads in the month of December alone. The App Store now offers more than 775,000 apps to over 0.5 billion accountholders in 155 countries, including over 300,000 native iPad apps. Cumulative app downloads have now surpassed 40 billion and we\u2019re delighted to have paid our app developers over 7 billion for sales of their incredible work. iPod continues to grow at amazing rate now with 250 million accounts and our customers love our iMessage service sending a staggering 2 billion plus iMessage\u2019s per day.I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, revenue was in all-time high of over 6.4 billion with growth yield primarily by record iPhone and iPad sales. We opened in total 11 new stores during the quarter including four new stores in Greater China. We excited the quarter with 401 stores, a 150 of which are outside United States. We also relocated or expanded 14 stores that had outgrown their former space during the quarter. With an average of 396 stores opened, average revenue per store was 16.3 million or 1.25 million per store per week compared to 1.22 million per store per week in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was 1.6 billion.We hosted a record 121 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to a 110 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to 23,000 visitors per store per week, a 7% increase year-over-year. Total company gross margin was 38.6% which was about 260 basis points higher than our guidance. About half of this difference were driven by lower products and transitory cost that we reflected in our guidance while the remainder resulted from a higher mix of iPhone\u2019s, a weaker U.S. dollar and leverage on the higher revenue.Operating expenses were 3.9 billion included 460 million in stock based compensation expense. (Inaudible) was 462 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short term and long term marketable securities totaled a 137.1 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to a 121 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential increase of almost 16 billion.The increase in cash was net of 2.5 billion in dividends paid and 2 billion in an upfront payment in conjunction with our accelerated share repurchase program. Over 94 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter. Cash flow from operations was a record 23.4 billion growing by almost 6 billion year-over-year of 33% increase. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.55 for common share payable on February 14th, 2013 the shareholders at record as of the close of business on February 11th, 2013.As we move ahead into the March quarter I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. In addition to the reporting changes that I\u2019ve already mentioned to further increase transparency into our business we\u2019re changing our approach to how we provide guidance. In recent years our guidance reflected a conservative point estimate of results every quarter that we have reasonable confidence in achieving. Going forward we plan to provide a range of guidance that reflects our belief of what we\u2019re likely to achieve. Well we cannot forecast with complete accuracy we believe we\u2019re likely to report within the range of guidance we provide. Therefore for the March quarter we\u2019re providing revenue guidance of between 41 billion and 43 billion compared to 39.2 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5% reflecting approximately 90 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between 3.8 billion and 3.9 billion including about 480 million related to stock based compensation.We expect other income/(expense) to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. In closing we\u2019re thrilled to have generated over 54 billion of revenue in a 13 week period while executing multiple major product transitions. We sold over 75 million iOS devices during the quarter which is a staggering number. We\u2019re producing our best products ever and the execution by our engineering, operations and sales teams to deliver 10s of millions of such innovative, beautifully designed products in such a short time frame is phenomenal. We\u2019re very pleased with our record iPhone and iPad sales, our record music moving and app sales and continued expansion of our robust eco-system. And finally we remain very confident in our new product pipeline.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thanks Tim. We\u2019re very pleased to report the results of Apple\u2019s first fiscal quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales, significantly broadened our eco-system and generated Apple\u2019s highest quarterly revenue and net income ever. Revenue for the quarter was 54.5 billion compared to 46.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 8.2 billion year-over-year. As a remainder our first quarter this fiscal year spanned 13 weeks whereas the first quarter last year included a 14th week. As such average weekly revenue was 4.2 billion in the current year quarter compared to 3.3 billion in the year ago quarter, an increase of 27%. The strong year-over-year growth was fuelled by record iPhone, iPad and iTune sales.Operating margin was 17.2 billion representing 31.6% of revenue. Net income was a record 13.1 billion just ahead of the amount generated in last year\u2019s 14 week quarter and translated to diluted earnings per share of $13.81. Beginning this fiscal year we\u2019re reorganizing the presentation of our results to provide greater transparency. First, we\u2019ve established a new operating segment of Greater China given the very significant contribution of that region to our overall business. We define Greater China to include Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Second, for segment reporting purposes we\u2019re allocating certain manufacturing cost and variances including cost related to product tooling and manufacturing process equipment to our operating segments instead of including these expenditures in corporate expenses as we have done in the past.We have recast our operating income for each quarter in fiscal 2011 and 2012 to reflect this change and have provided a reconciliation on Apple.com/Investor. These changes have no impact in overall reported operating income. And third, we have realigned the presentation of product information in our summary data schedule to provide greater visibility to revenue by product category. Under this new format revenue from iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod sales is presented exclusive of related service and accessory revenue. All revenue from iTunes, stand-alone Apple and third party software and services is presented as a single line item and revenue from all Apple and third party accessory sales is presented as a single line item. We believe this presentation provides a logical grouping of revenue sources and also provides greater transparency into our results. As for the details of this quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We were very pleased to sell 47.8 million iPhones compared to 37 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of over 10 million iPhones.This represents a rate of almost 3.7 million iPhones per week in the current year quarter compared to 2.6 million per week in the year ago quarter. That\u2019s an average increase of 39% per week consistent with IDC\u2019s latest published forecast for the global smartphone market in the December quarter.And on a sequential basis iPhone sales grew 78% over the September quarter\u2019s results. That\u2019s over 3.5 times IDC\u2019s latest published projection for sequential growth of the overall market resulting in iPhone market share growth. We experienced strong iPhone growth in each of our geographic segments most notably Greater China where iPhone sales more than doubled year-over-year. In the U.S. Kantar Worldpanel Comtech estimates that iPhone shares of smartphones sales increased from 45% in the year ago quarter to over 51% in the current year quarter.iPhone sales were driven by the tremendous popularity of iPhone 5 which we\u2019re extremely proud to have launched in 100 countries by the end of December resulting in the fastest iPhone rollout ever. We ended the quarter with about 10.6 million iPhones in channel inventory a sequential increase of about 1.5 million iPhones and ended the quarter within our target range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory on a look forward basis. While other mobile devices and operating systems faced increasing security risks and fragmented inconsistent user experiences, iPhone and iOS continued to deliver an exceptional experience that people love.They also provide a secure and trusted eco-system that IT departments require. iPhone continues to be embraced by government agencies and businesses across the globe. Many U.S. government agencies are issuing iPhones by the 1000s as part of their new mobile strategies. Some examples include NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration.We are also seeing continued iPhone growth in business across the board from companies replacing existing smartphone deployments to businesses adding first-time smartphone users. Companies around the world like Neiman Marcus, Skanska, and Volvo are issuing iPhones to their employees to improve interactions with customers and give workers access to essential corporate data.Turning to iPad, we were thrilled to sell 22.9 million iPads during the quarter compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to over 1.7 million iPads per week in the current year quarter compared to 1.1 million per week in the year ago quarter, an average increase of 60% per week, ahead of IDC\u2019s latest published estimate of 56% growth for the tablet market. Customers are loving the fourth generation iPad with its faster performance and spectacular Retina display. And the iPad mini has been a tremendous hit offering the full iPad experience in an incredible design that you can hold in one hand.In addition to the tremendous response from consumers, iPad continues to be the tablet of choice for businesses and government agencies transforming the way their employees work. Financial institutions like Barclays, Nomura Securities, and Bank of Beijing are deploying iPad to enable employees to better service customers and work securely with financial portfolios and products. In particular, Barclays roll out of over 8000 iPads has generated tremendous employee engagement and feedback making it the most successful IT deployment in Barclays\u2019 history. State and local governments in the United States are also rapidly adopting iPad. Court systems, county inspectors, and law enforcement agencies use iPad to streamline processes and replace huge amounts of paper. And state legislatures in Virginia, Texas, and West Virginia are all using iPads to give lawmakers instant access to government documents and information.Outside the U.S., 10,000 iPads are being deployed as part of broad adoption of a local government workflow solution in Sweden and over 5,000 iPads have been purchased by the government in the Netherlands for the Dutch Tax Authority and the Dutch Court System. We began and ended the quarter with about 3.4 million iPads in channel inventory. That left us below our target range of four to six weeks of iPad channel inventory on a look-forward basis.Turning to Mac, we sold 4.1 million units in the quarter compared to 5.2 million in the year ago quarter. IDC estimates the global personal computer market contracted by 6% during the December quarter. We introduced the new 13-inch MacBook Pro Retina display as well as our stunning new iMacs in October. As we projected a quarter ago, we were significantly constrained with respect to the new iMacs and were only able to ship them for the final month of the December quarter. We believe our Mac sales would have been much higher absent those constraints. We began and ended the quarter with between three and four weeks of Mac channel inventory on a look-forward basis, which is below our target range of four to five weeks.Moving to iPod, we sold 12.7 million iPods compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. iPod touch was a popular item in the holiday season and continues to account for over of half of all iPods sold during the December quarter. iPod\u2019s share of U.S. market for MP3 players was over 70% in the December quarter based on the latest data published by MPD and iPod continued to be the top selling MP3 player in most countries we track based on the latest data published by GFK.iTunes generated record results with revenue of $2.1 billion in the quarter. We established new all-time quarterly records for revenue from music, from movies, and from apps. We significantly expanded the footprint of our ecosystem during the quarter adding iTunes music stores in 56 countries, including Russia, Turkey, India and South Africa. That brings us to a total of 119 countries, where customers can choose from over 20 million songs to purchase and download.The App Store had a record-breaking December quarter with over 2 billion downloads in the month of December alone. The App Store now offers more than 775,000 apps to over 0.5 billion accountholders in 155 countries, including over 300,000 native iPad apps. Cumulative app downloads have now surpassed 40 billion and we\u2019re delighted to have paid our app developers over 7 billion for sales of their incredible work. iPod continues to grow at amazing rate now with 250 million accounts and our customers love our iMessage service sending a staggering 2 billion plus iMessage\u2019s per day.I would now like to turn to the Apple retail stores, revenue was in all-time high of over 6.4 billion with growth yield primarily by record iPhone and iPad sales. We opened in total 11 new stores during the quarter including four new stores in Greater China. We excited the quarter with 401 stores, a 150 of which are outside United States. We also relocated or expanded 14 stores that had outgrown their former space during the quarter. With an average of 396 stores opened, average revenue per store was 16.3 million or 1.25 million per store per week compared to 1.22 million per store per week in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was 1.6 billion.We hosted a record 121 million visitors to our stores during the quarter compared to a 110 million in the year ago quarter. That translates to 23,000 visitors per store per week, a 7% increase year-over-year. Total company gross margin was 38.6% which was about 260 basis points higher than our guidance. About half of this difference were driven by lower products and transitory cost that we reflected in our guidance while the remainder resulted from a higher mix of iPhone\u2019s, a weaker U.S. dollar and leverage on the higher revenue.Operating expenses were 3.9 billion included 460 million in stock based compensation expense. (Inaudible) was 462 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 26%. Turning to cash, our cash plus short term and long term marketable securities totaled a 137.1 billion at the end of the December quarter compared to a 121 billion at the end of the September quarter, a sequential increase of almost 16 billion.The increase in cash was net of 2.5 billion in dividends paid and 2 billion in an upfront payment in conjunction with our accelerated share repurchase program. Over 94 billion of our total cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter. Cash flow from operations was a record 23.4 billion growing by almost 6 billion year-over-year of 33% increase. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $2.55 for common share payable on February 14th, 2013 the shareholders at record as of the close of business on February 11th, 2013.As we move ahead into the March quarter I would like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call.

Therefore for the March quarter we\u2019re providing revenue guidance of between 41 billion and 43 billion compared to 39.2 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5% reflecting approximately 90 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be between 3.8 billion and 3.9 billion including about 480 million related to stock based compensation.We expect other income/(expense) to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. In closing we\u2019re thrilled to have generated over 54 billion of revenue in a 13 week period while executing multiple major product transitions.

Good afternoon. Hey, Tim can you maybe discuss the tablet market a little bit in relation to Macs and other PCs is sort of how you are thinking about the cannibalization of that market for the iPad relative to the PC market? And then secondly, typically each quarter, you sort of talk about some of the component constraints and you certainly talked about iPhone 4 being constrained and the iPad mini is better, so as you enter into the quarter where do you see the challenges for meeting demand for the calendar first quarter? Thanks.  \nTim Cook:   Sure. Let me take the second part of that first. I think overall our team did just a fantastic job ramping a record number of new products during the quarter. We did have significant shortages due to robust demand on both iPad mini and both models of the iMac that persisted the entire quarter. And we are still short of both of those today as the matter of fact. Additionally, supply of iPhone 5 which short to demand until late in the quarter and iPhone 4 was short for the entire quarter, we believe that we can achieve a supply demand balance on iPad mini during this quarter and on iPhone 4 during this quarter. On iMac, we are confident that we are going to significantly increase the supply, but the demand here is very strong and we are not certain that we will achieve a supply demand balance during the quarter.   In terms of cannibalization and how we think about this, I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity for us. One, our base philosophy is to never fear cannibalization. If we do, somebody else will just cannibalize it and so we never fear it. We know that iPhone has cannibalized some iPod business. It doesn\u2019t worry us, but it\u2019s done that. We know that iPad will cannibalize some Macs that doesn\u2019t worry us. On iPad in particular, we have the mother of all opportunities here, because the Windows market is much, much larger than the Mac market is. And I think it is clear that it is clear that it\u2019s already cannibalizing some and I think there is a tremendous amount more opportunity there. And as you know, I have said for two or three, actually three years now I believe that I believe the tablet market will be larger than the PC market at some point. And I still believe that. And you can see by the growth in tablets and the pressure on PCs that those lines are beginning to converge.   And I think the other thing for us maybe not for others, but for us is if somebody will buys an iPad mini or an iPad and it\u2019s their first Apple product, we had great experience through the years of knowing that when somebody buys their first Apple product that a percentage of these people windup buying another type of Apple product. And so if you remember what we had termed the halo effect for some time with the iPod, with the Mac, we are very confident that, that will happen and we are seeing some evidence of that on the iPad as well. And so I see cannibalization as a huge opportunity.  \nNancy Paxton:   Thank you, Scott. Can we have the next question please?  \nOperator:   And we will go to Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.  \nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan:   Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Question Tim around the iPhone, Peter gave some transparency around the qualitative sequential and year-over-year potential increases in the iPad for the March quarter. How should we think about the iPhone family against that in terms of year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter potential increases or decreases, and are there any sort of dynamics around slower pace of LTE rollouts by the network carriers having an impact?  \nTim Cook:  \nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan:\nTim Cook:  \nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan:   Okay, thank you.  \nNancy Paxton:   Thanks Mark. Can we have the next question please?  \nOperator:   From Deutsche Bank we\u2019ll go to Chris Whitmore.  \nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank:   Thanks. Just a follow-up on the iPhone question with respect to the guidance, just, assuming there is some benefit from the Mac carryover effect and iPad release etcetera, and adjusting for the inventory, it seems you are guiding to kind of mid to high single-digit year-on-year unit growth for the iPhone business from a sell-through standpoint. Is that the right ballpark we should be thinking about and why the big deceleration from the 25% plus kind of weekly sales rate you quoted in your intro comments?  \nPeter Oppenheimer:   Sure, Chris, it\u2019s Peter. We are not going to talk about guidance at a specific product level, but let me give you some things we thought about in coming up with the range of $41 billion to $43 billion. It is that range is a 5% to 10% year-over-year increase. And there are few factors that are impacting the year-over-year results making the strong performance of the business a little bit harder to see. So, let me point a few of these out. First of all, as we have talked about several times on the call, last year in the March quarter, we\u2019ve built 2.6 million units of iPhone channel inventory, which allowed us to get into our 4 to 6-week range. That increased the revenue in the year ago quarter by $1.6 billion. And as Tim talked about that was sell-in that was not sell-through, we are thinking about the business on a sell-through basis. So, don\u2019t lose sight of the 1.6 billion.   Second, the iPhone 5 rollout this year, has been our fastest ever. We are selling in 100 countries by the end of December. Last year, we did not achieve this country distribution until the March quarter, which included China that we launched in January. Third, we made a very good strategic decision to introduce the iPad mini which customers love and to keep the price reduced iPad 2 in the line. As a result of this, we saw a reduction in our iPad ASPs of about $101 year-over-year in the December quarter. And you can see that, our iPad units grew faster than our iPad revenue in the December quarter. We would expect iPad ASPs to be down quite a bit in the March quarter on a year-over-year basis for the same reasons.   And then finally, the PC market grew 4% last year in the March quarter, and this year IDC is projecting that to decline by 3%. So, considering these factors, the underlying performance of the business is much stronger than the 5% to 10% year-over-year growth implies and we remain very confident in our business and our new product pipeline.  \nChris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank:   And for my follow-up I wanted to come back to something Tim said earlier about that you are not fearing cannibalization; I wanted to ask in context of your iPhone business given the strength you are seeing at the low end of your product line the iPhone 4 being stocked out during the quarter. There seems to be a lot of demand at lower price points for the iPhone, why not get more aggressive at lower price bands and move down market in the iPhone business? Thanks.  \nTim Cook:   I am not going to go into our pricing strategy, but we feel great about the opportunity of getting products to customers and a percentage of those buying other Apple products. And that we have obviously seen evidence of that through history and continue to see evidence of that today.\nNancy Paxton:\nOperator:"}], "2015": [{"symbol": "AAPL", "quarter": 4, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-10-20 17:00:00", "content": "Executives: Nancy Paxton - Senior Director of Investor Relations Tim Cook - CEO Luca Maestri - SVP and CFO\nAnalysts: Shannon Cross - Cross Research Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein Steven Milunovich - UBS Ben Reitzes - Barclays Gene Munster - Piper Jaffray Keith Buckman - Bank of Montreal\nPresentation:\nOperator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Apple Incorporated Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. And I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for joining us. Since we spoke in July, it's been an exciting and very busy time, so we have lots of great things to talk about today. Just last month, we launched the biggest advancements in iPhone's history with iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. These iPhones are the best we have ever created and customers absolutely love them. Our operational team has done an extraordinary job executing the manufacturing ramp throughout the entire supply chain. Today we've launched in 32 countries including China and our new iPhones will be shifting in 69 countries and territories by the end of this month, making this our fastest and most successful iPhone launch ever. Demand for the new iPhones has been staggering and geographically broad-based markedly higher in every single country where we've launched compared to the iPhone 5s a year ago. We're working hard to fill orders as fast as possible and we're on track to be in more than 115 countries by the end of December. Last month we introduced two new categories; the first is Apple Pay, an entirely new way to pay for things in stores and in apps. It makes mobile payments easier, more secure and more private. Apple Pay went live today and now making purchases and participating stores happens with just a touch of a finger. Paying within apps is as easy as selecting Apple Pay and placing a finger on Touch ID. Today Apple Pay supports credit and debit cards from the three major payment networks and the top U.S. banks and over 500 additional banks have signed on and will be supporting Apple Pay beginning this year and early next year. Apple Pay is being supported by many of the nation's top retailers and we continue to sign more retailers. The second new category is Apple Watch, our most personal device ever and one that has already captured the world's imagination. We can't wait to get Apple Watch to customers beginning in early calendar 2015. We'll be providing more details on Apple Watch as we get closer to the shipment day. Last week we launched the new iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 with innovations that make them dramatically better than previous generation and the stunning new iMac with a Retina 5K display. We released iOS 8 last month and our customers are enjoying new ways to use their iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch with intuitive new features and groundbreaking security. Last week, we also released OS X Yosemite, with an all new design and continuity features that deliver an even more fluid experience across all of our iOS devices and Mac. These introductions reflect years of innovation and hard work by teams all across Apple and they demonstrate the seamless integration of hardware, software and services that provides unparallel user experiences for our customers. These are things that only Apple can do. We've also communicated and demonstrated our commitment to respecting and protecting users' privacy with strong encryption and strict policies that govern how our data is handled. Today we're also reporting very strong results for Apple's fourth fiscal quarter. We generated our strongest revenue growth rate in seven quarters far surpassing our expectations we communicated in July and establishing a new record for Apple's September quarter revenue. We're also reporting gross margin of 38% compared to 37% last year, leading to a very strong EPS growth of 20%. Fueled by the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus and strong demand for our previous iPhone models, we set a new September quarter record for iPhone with revenue growth of 21% year-over-year. Demand for iPhone was strong across all geographies with global unit sell-through growth of 26% and we exited the quarter with significant backlog for both iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. We established an all-time quarterly record for Mac sales with revenue growing 18% year-over-year, thanks in particular to the very strong performance of our portables. We're especially proud of our Mac results considering the overall contraction of the global PC market this year and we achieved our highest quarterly market share since 1995. We also set an all-time record for the App Store revenue, thanks to the tremendous momentum and ongoing success of our developer community. App Store revenue grew 36% over last year and cumulative app downloads have now topped 85 billion. These results bring to a close a record breaking fiscal 2014. Over the last four quarters, our products and services have generated a $183 billion in revenues, an increase of $12 billion over last year. We sold 243 million iOS devices and 19 million Macs, both all-time highs. Our revenue from iTunes software and services reached $18 billion, which was more than the annual sales of two thirds of the companies in the Fortune 500 and we generated $6.45 in earnings per share, which is 14% higher than last year and also set a new record. We made big investments in our business and have continued to expand our global footprint. Today we have 437 Apple retail stores in 15 countries and our partners are selling Apple products in hundreds of thousands of locations around the world. We're continuing to invest in developing markets where revenues approached $50 million in fiscal year '14, up 16% over last year and twice the rate of growth of the company overall. We [forged] (ph) a landmark partnership with IBM to provide a new generation of mobile enterprise application designed with our products legendary ease of use and backed by IBM's cloud services and data analytics. Our partnership aims to redefine the way work is done, address key industry mobility challenges and sparked true mobile-led business change. Developer teams have been working closely to develop the first wave of Mobile First solutions and these solutions will be ready for customers beginning next month across six sectors; banking, government, insurance, retail, travel and transportation and telecommunication. We brought tremendous new talent and technology into Apple through 20 acquisitions in fiscal '14 including seven alone in the September quarter. We closed the Beats transition in July and we're off to a great start with some wonderful plans we'll share with you in the future. Our strong results continue to generate significant cash and we're extremely happy that this has enabled us to make substantial investments in Apple's future, while retaining -- while returning cash to our shareholders. We had executed aggressively against our share repurchase program, spending $17 billion in the September quarter alone and $45 billion in the last year. In addition to Apple's strong business performance over the past four quarters, I am incredibly proud of all of our work to protect the environment, to advance human rights, to improve working conditions in the supply chain and to change the way teachers teach and students learn. I'd like to thank all of our customers, employees, developers and business partners for making fiscal 2014 Apple's best year yet and I'd like to thank all of our shareholders for their continued support. I could not be more excited about the road ahead in fiscal 2015. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our September quarter results in more detail.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. During the September quarter we generated record revenue of $42.1 billion, an increase $4.7 billion or 12% year-over-year. These results exceeded our guidance range due to better than expected sales of iPhones and Macs for which customer demand grew strongly year-over-year in all our segments. Gross margin was 38% at the high end of the guidance range, operating margin was $11.2 billion representing 26.5% of revenue. Net income was $8.5 billion, a new September quarter record translating to diluted earnings per share of $1.42, a 20% year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was very strong, a $13.3 billion, also a new Q4 record. For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 39.3 million iPhones, an increase of 5.5 million over last year or 16% growth. Underlying demand was even stronger with sell-through growth of 26%. iPhone sales grew across both developed and emerging markets. Unit sales in the U.S. grew 17% year-over-year, and in Western Europe they were up 20%. We saw even stronger growth in Latin America and the Middle East with sales up more than 50% and in Central and Eastern Europe where sales more than doubled. We increased iPhone channel inventory by just under one million units during the September quarter this year, significantly less than the 3.3 million unit increase in the September quarter a year ago. Based on the very strong demand for our new iPhones, this left us below our target range of four to six weeks for channel inventory on a look forward basis. iPhone momentum in enterprise market remains very strong. The latest data published by IDC indicates that iPhone have 69% share of the U.S. commercial smartphone market. Also, In August ChangeWave survey of U.S. corporate IT buyers found that among those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter 75% plan to purchase iPhones. An iPhone continues to fuel innovation of companies around the world. Schindler, a leading global escalator and elevator manufacturer has deployed over 20,000 iPhones and 20 customer apps to improve customer engagements for safety and to allow service technicians to access vital documentation, repair and safety functions when they are in the field. Baidu, China's top search provider currently has over 20,000 employees using iPhones and the company has developed over 30 in-house iOS apps to help its employees work more efficiently, track sales leads and manage internal IT infrastructure and processes. Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost a million over last year. That represents 21% growth year-over-year and an all-time quarterly record. We saw great demand in the back-to-school season for both desktops and portables with especially strong growth for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. We achieved double-digit Mac growth across most markets around the world, with particularly impressive performance in emerging markets where Mac sales were up 46%. These results are truly remarkable given the contraction in the global PC market and we now gain market share for 33 of the last 34 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range. Turning to iPad, we sold 12.3 million units compared to 14.1 million in the September quarter last year. In anticipation of our October new product announcement we reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end of the June quarter, which left us within our target range of channel inventory on a look-back basis. iPad sales were consistent with our expectations and we experienced very strong results in Japan where iPad sales were up 46% year-over-year. Customers continue to love their iPads. In an August survey by ChangeWave iPad Mini with retina display earned an incredible 100% satisfaction rate, and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, the survey indicated a 55% plan to buy an iPad. We continue to see some momentum in enterprise for iPad. Progressive IT organizations around the world continue to deploy, manage and develop amazing in-house apps for iPad. Healthcare leader Sanofi has over 25,000 iPads and over 450 in-house apps for sales teams and corporate employees to get their products and information into the hands of doctors and other healthcare providers. Premium eyewear designer Luxottica has deployed over 10,000 iPads to improve how customers experience the size, fit and overall look of eyewear in a retail environment. Importantly, since the announcement of the partnership with IBM hundreds of corporations around the world have expressed interest in MobileFirst solutions and we are actively working with over 50 of them to become foundational client for MobileFirst solutions in their industries. iPad continues to lead the U.S. education tablet market with 90% share based on the latest data from IDC. In the September quarter the St. Paul public school in Minnesota purchased over 22,000 iPad Airs and over 5,000 iPad Minis in the first race of the district's personalized learning through technology plan that will ultimately equip every student with an iPad. We are fully consistent and continue to strive. Our item store generated all time record billings of $5.4 billion in the September quarter, up 22% year-over-year, thanks to the tremendous momentum of the app store. Developers around the world have embraced the iOS platform and keep broadening the appeal of our thoughtfully designed app store to a large, loyal and engaged customer base. Across all of our programs the number of registered app developers has grown by 22% in the last year and we are rapidly approaching 10 million. We are seeing especially strong interest in the enterprise with a number of registered developers is up 39% over a year ago. Our retail stores also generated strong results. Revenue for the quarter was $5.1 billion, up 15% from a year ago and a new September quarter record. We opened 10 new stores and completed the remodels of three stores during the quarter ending with a total of 437 stores, 41% of which are outside the United States. We are projecting a total of approximately 25 new store openings in fiscal '15, about three quarters of which will be outside the U.S. We also plan to remodel about five stores over the course of the year. With an average of 432 stores opened in the September quarter average revenue per store was $11.9 million compared to $10.9 million in the year ago quarter. We hosted 102 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates to over 18,000 visitors per store per week. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $155.2 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $9.3 billion. We are continue to execute our capital return program aggressively with the total spend of over $20 billion in just the September quarter. We launched our fourth accelerated share repurchase program at the end of August spending $9 billion. We also spent $8 billion to repurchase $81 million Apple's shares to open market transactions, paid $2.8 billion in dividends and equivalence and utilized over $300 million to net share sell vesting employee RSUs. So, we've already taken action on over $94 billion of our $130 billion capital return program including $68 billion in share repurchases with five quarters remaining to its completion. We remained firmly committed to our objective of delivering attractive returns to shareholders through both business performance and return of capital. As we said before, we review our capital allocation regularly. We have solicited feedback on our capital return program from shareholders in the past and we will continue to do so. We plan to report on our conclusions in a timeframe similar to last year. Now, as we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63.5 billion and $66.5 billion compared to $57.6 billion in the year ago quarter. This represents a double-digit revenue increase despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $325 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%. Also today our Board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on November 13, 2014, to shareholders of record as of November 10, 2014. With that, I will hand it over to Nancy for some final remarks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Luca. We'd like to let you know about some reporting changes that we'll be making beginning with the release of our Q1 '15 results. First, to better serve our customers and optimize our results around the world we are collaborating like never before across our direct and indirect channels. Accordingly, beginning in Q1 '15, we'll be including the results of our retail stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located providing a consolidated view of regional performance that is consistent with the way our executive team measures the business. This means that going forward our reportable segment will be Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and the rest of Asia-Pacific with the retail no longer classified as a segment. Second, to better reflect our evolving products and services, we'll be making some changes to our product summary reporting. We will continue to report iPhone, iPad and Macs as separate line items and we'll also have a category that we refer to as services and this will encompass everything we report under the heading of iTunes software and services today including content, apps, licensing and other services and beginning this month it will also include Apple Pay. We'll be creating a new reporting category called other products. This will encompass everything we report in the accessories category today including Beats headphones and speakers, Apple TV and peripherals and accessories for iPhone, iPad, Mac and iPod. In addition, we will begin to include iPod sales in the other products category and we will also reflect sales of Apple Watch in this line item once it begins shipping in early calendar 2015. So to recap, beginning in Q1 '15. our products reporting categories will be iPhone, iPad, Mac, services and other products. We wanted to give analysts and investors a heads up on these plans so you can reflect them in your models accordingly. We'll also reclassify historical results to be consistent with these newer groupings and we'll provide that information on our Investor Relations website when we release Q1 results. And finally, our distribution channels have evolved and expanded significantly in the last couple of years including traditional resellers, consumer electronic stores, mass retailers, distributors and carriers, and each of these channels have the different distribution model. Today, iPhone is sold in over 200,000 locations around the world and iPad is sold in more than 100,000. In addition, revenue from emerging markets has increased considerably over the last few years and now accounts for over quarter of our sales. And channel inventory requirements in those markets tend to be much longer. So, due to the size, complexity and different needs of our channels around the world we've determined that a five to seven week average range for both iPhone and iPad channel inventory is more appropriate and that will be our target range going forward. However, given the backlog for our new products, we expect to exit the December quarter within our old four to six weeks target range. So with that let's open the call to questions and we ask that you please limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thank you very much. Good afternoon. My first question is with regard to Apple Pay, which we actually used this afternoon and where it was rolled out it actually worked pretty well which was nice, but could you provide some more color, Tim and Luca, on how you see the business model for Apple? And maybe from a high level perspective, if you see there's more over time becoming a standalone business like you look at iTunes, or is this more just a way to sell incremental product?\nTim Cook: Shannon, hi, it's Tim. The -- what we wanted to achieve with Apple Pay was first and foremost to have an incredible consumer experience. And so we focused very much on making it elegant and simple and hopefully your trails have proven them. I know I used it over the weekend and it worked fantastically. We also wanted to focus on security and privacy, and so we see huge issues with the security of the traditional credit card system. And many people that have entered mobile payments are doing still in a way that they want to monetize the data that they collect from the customers and we think customers in general do not want this that they'd like to keep their data private. And so, we wanted to have ease of use, security and privacy and maximize all three. By doing so, we think we will sell more devices because we think it's a killer feature. It's far better than reaching in your pocket book and trying to find the card that you're looking for and half the time it's not working. There -- we do not charge the customer for the benefit. We do not charge the merchant for the benefit. However, there are commercial terms between Apple and the issuing banks, but we're not disclosing what they are, like any other contractual arrangement those are private things. And so as Nancy was saying in her closing comments, we'll be reporting Apple Pay in the services line item on the data sheet. And so, we see it as an incredible service that is the most customer-centric mobile payment system that there is. And we are very proud of it and can't wait to sign up more retailers and also extend it around the world.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thank you. And then, Luca, if you could talk a little bit about the impact of currency. In IBM's results this morning they talked substantially about potential pressure going forward from currency. So could you walk us through how your hedges work, how we should think about currency and how you reflected in at least the current quarter guidance?\nLuca Maestri: Yeah. Definitely, Shannon. As you know, the U.S. dollar has strengthened quite significantly against most currencies in recent weeks. When we looked at our Q4 results actually the impact was fairly limited combination of the hedging program and the fact that the dollar really strengthened towards the very end of the quarter. Not much impact in Q4. It is becoming a significant headwind in Q1 both on a year-over-year basis and on a sequential basis. As I said before, we have reflected the new FX situation at current levels into our guidance that we provided for both revenue and gross margins. And it's a fact of life if the U.S. dollar strengthens, that creates a headwind for us both in revenue and margins for our business outside the United States. As you know, we have a comprehensive hedging program in place that mitigates the impact of foreign exchange. Over time, of course, these hedges roll off and get replaced by new hedges at new spot levels, and so the protection that you get from hedging program is temporary. But again, the guidance that we provided fully reflects that current situation in the FX markets.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Shannon, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: And from Goldman Sachs we'll hear from Bill Shope.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: Okay. Thank you. Could you comment on how we should think about the key swing factors for gross margins in the December quarter, obviously outside the FX impact you just mentioned, Luca? And more broadly, I know it's still early, but how should we think about the gross margin path as the iPhone 6 family ramps versus what we saw with the 5S and 5C cycle. I guess you can answer that specifically. I'm trying to figure out if you characterize this as a fairly normal cycle in terms of expected cost improvements over the life of the product.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Bill let me start with put and takes of margins for Q1. I would say that on the positive we are so pleased with the launch of new phones you might have seen phenomenal. So we think we're going to be getting favorable impact from iPhone mix. Of course, we're also going to be getting some positive leverage from the higher revenues that we guided to and we continue to see fairly favorable commodity environment. So these are the things that are on the positive side. On the negative side I've talked about FX. Obviously we have launched a lot of new products even in the last six weeks and we've got transition costs as we move from current products to new products and that tends to be a headwind. And every time we launch new products, we make them better and what that means is that our cost structures tend to go up when we produce new products. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures down over time and so when you take the positives and negatives that I have just mentioned that is what gives us the guidance that we just provided.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: Okay great. And then my second question is, looking at that current supply constraints of the iPhone, could you confirm that your guidance is assuming you will reach supply demand balance before the end of the quarter, I think that's what was implied by your commentary on channel inventory? And related to that, could you give us some more color on what you see as the key bottlenecks at this point for supply on the iPhone side?\nTim Cook: Bill its Tim. The ramp itself is going great. The chances are ever in our history, so I couldn\u2019t be happier with it. That said, today demand is far obstructing supply. It is unclear looking at the data when supply will catch up with demand. And so I don\u2019t want to leave you with a view that we know that we're going to get to a supply-demand balance on both of the new products this quarter because I don\u2019t know that at this point. It's very difficult to gauge demand without first achieving finding the balance and it's clear that as of today, and certainly as of the end of the quarter where you're looking at the data, we're not nearly, we're not close, we're not on the same plan. And -- but that said, I am really confident that supply is going to be great and that's the reason you see incredibly strong guidance that we're giving from $63.5 billion to $66.5 billion. At -- but at this point, it's just very difficult to gauge what the true demand is. When you see it's very unusual to see every country having a marked improvement over the previous year and that's what we're seeing on iPhone. And so, I couldn\u2019t be happier with the way the demand looks. Nancy's comment at the end was meant to tell you that we do not envision as of today being able to achieve the extra inventory in the channel that we believe is needed when you think about the long food chains in some of the emerging markets where the distribution channels are not as official, so that's the purpose of that comment.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: Okay, that's helpful, thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Bill. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Luca I wonder if you can quantify the currency headwind on gross margin in the December quarter, just because there is a big focus on currency across tech right now and should we expect price harmonization if the dollar remained strong? And then I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Katy, it's you know I said that there's headwinds from foreign exchange are going to be significant. So -- and I would tell you that they are more significant when you look at it from a year-over-year basis that it is on a sequential basis because clearly the dollar has been strengthening for quite a while particularly against certain currencies like the Yen or the Canadian dollar a lot of the emerging market currencies. So it's again impact and that's the reason why we wanted to call it out.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Will you do any price harmonization if the dollar remained strong?\nLuca Maestri: No, we price our products in a way that is in general reflective of pricing here in the United States and it's a pricing that we want to keep in place for reasonable periods of time. We do not like to make sudden changes to our pricing.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Okay, then as a follow up, I wonder if you can comment on the how NAND capacity and SKU mix is tracking versus your expectations for iPhone 6?\nTim Cook: Yeah Katy, it's Tim. At this point, we're selling everything we made. And so it's difficult to say that we've been -- that we've absolutely made it well on the SKU mix and the split between the iPhone 6 and the 6 Plus. From everything we can tell, we've done a pretty good job on that. But I'll stop short of saying there is no issue at all, because it's hard to tell when you are at a point where you are selling everything you are making. It is a good problem to have.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Got it, congrats on the quarter.\nTim Cook: Thank you, very much, thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Katy. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Sanford Bernstein we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi. And Toni you may want to check your mute button.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Yes, sorry about that. I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca the question for you is a bit of a follow up from the last one which is that we saw a pretty robust sequential increase in ASPs this quarter in the iPhone and I was wondering if you could qualitatively help us understand whether that was a higher mix of new phones than you typically see in the September quarter or was it really a function of the new phones having a richer ASP? And if we look forward to calendar fiscal Q1, last year you had a very substantial ASP increase, should we be thinking about a similar kind of ASP increase this quarter given I think a widespread belief that availability on the 6 Plus has been even more constrained and that we could see a much higher percentage of 6 Plus as a percentage of total iPhones shipped in the quarter and next quarter?\nLuca Maestri: Yes Toni. So, on a sequential basis our ASPs for iPhone were up $42. And as you said correctly the reason for the increase was a higher mix of the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. There was a partial offset in the quarter from the transition cost that we incurred typically when we moved to a new product. Going forward obviously, the percentage of new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus will increase sequentially as we are going to have the full quarter available to us and it's correct that iPhone 6 Plus is supply constrained right now.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Okay and then Tim for you, I was wondering again qualitatively if you could help us understand what you think the mix of repeat buyers is for iPhone 6 let's say over the next year versus first time iPhone customers. And you know the question in that is, do you believe that because the iPhone 6 is so compelling that that traditional replacement cycle might be accelerated over the next several quarters? And if that\u2019s ultimately the case, do you in the future run reversion back towards in the elongating of that replacement cycle in future generations?\nTim Cook: It is difficult to answer exactly, but let me sort of back up and give you some data, maybe that will help frame the topic. So if you look at some of our top countries and how they did in the mid year of selling a customer the first iPhone they had ever bought. What you would see is that in countries like China over 80% of the people that we were selling the 4s2 were buying the first iPhone ever in the U.S. it was over 60%. And so those kind of give you some goalpost of large countries in terms of first time ownership at our entry level. As you step across and look at the 5s, which was at that time the top end phone, in China still almost half the people were buying their first iPhone ever buying try this and about a quarter of the U.S. population buying a 5s or buying their first one. So that kind of gives you some goalpost and so, the way I look at those numbers are, that on a forward basis what would I expect, obviously we don\u2019t give guidance on this kind of stuff is that I still see a fairly large opportunity in people buying their first iPhone ever and I think with these products that we just announced with 6 and 6 Plus that opportunity increases not decreases. I also believe that the upgrade market for people that were waiting for 6, for iPhone 6 or 6 Plus, as we can see from our order backlog that number is huge. And so I would expect that to go on for some period of time because you have people that time out of contract at different time, no everybody does that at launch time. And so I see both the first time buyer being a great opportunity and the up-grader. Some of the first time buyers are people that have never owned a smartphone before and some of them are switchers from android. And so, right now, everything, all of those look very good to us, but we're in the early going and we're selling everything we're making and so it's going to take some period of time before we have a better handle on what those numbers will look like in steady state. But I've never felt so great after a launch before, maybe that's the best way to summarized it all.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Toni. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From UBS we'll hear from Steven Milunovich.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS: Thanks. Is there more color you can give us on the mix of 6 and 6 Plus, particularly to the degree you see it in the order book? Our book suggests it's maybe 2.5 to 1, 6 to 6 Plus in the U.S., but and maybe that geographically it's quite different. Asia may be going for the bigger screen is there any color you can give us?\nTim Cook: Steve, there's not a lot of color that I can give that I feel is terribly accurate because as I said before, we're selling everything we're making and so essentially what our current sell through looks like is our current supply. And so in the long arc of time, once there is enough supply to meet demand that mix might look differently. Digits clear or at least I think that we will see a difference by geography in terms of preference and we thought that going into the launch of -- and there's no data that we perceived to date that would suggest that, that's not the case and so that's all about all I can say at this point.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS: Okay. And then regarding the strength in Mac and the weakness in iPad I guess, what's the message from the market that you take away from that and does that perhaps at all affect your view of doing a convertible type product which in the past has not kind of an Apple's approach, you tend to like to do very focused products there might be that there is something in between that could be quite successful?\nTim Cook: Let me comment on both the Mac and the iPad. On the Mac it was just absolutely blow-away order. Our best ever, it will result in our highest market share since 1995. It's just absolutely stunning. Get back-to-school season voted and the Mac 1 and carried the day and we're really proud of that. I'm proud of the Mac team. It's clear that the -- all the work that we've put into our Notebooks, on the hardware and the software side is resonating with our customers and I think if you went out to college campuses about now, you will see a lot of Mac and there are lot of new Mac Notebooks there based on the sales. And so that feels fantastic being up 21% in that market that's shrinking it just -- it doesn\u2019t get better than that. For iPad, if I take a step back on iPad, and I know that there is a lot of negative commentary in the market on this, but I have a little different perspective on it. Here's sort of my simple perspective. If you look at, instead of looking at this thing each 90 days, if you back up and look at it, we've sold 237 million in just over four years. That's about twice the number of iPhones that we sold over the first four years of iPhone. If you look at the last 12 months of iPad, we sold 68 million in '13, in fiscal year '13 we sold 71 million. So we were down, but we were down 4% on sell in and the sell-through was a bit better than the negative 4 because we took down channel inventories. And so, to me I view it as a speed bob, not a huge issue. That's said, we want to grow. We don\u2019t like negative numbers on these things and so, looking further in the data, I know that there is a popular view that the market is saturated, but we don\u2019t see that. I can't speak to other people but I do look at our data deeply. And in the last market research data we have is in the June quarter, and let me give you some of this -- the real data that we've got. is that if you look at our top six revenue countries, in the country that\u2019s sold the lowest percentage of iPads to people who had never bought an iPad before that number is 50%. And the range goes from 50 to over 70. And so when I look at number, our first time buyer rates in that area, it is saturated, that's not a saturated market. You never have first time buyer rates at 50% and 70%. What you do see is that people hold on to iPad longer than they do a phone. And because we've only been in this business four years, we don\u2019t really know what the upgrade cycle will be for people. And so that's a difficult thing to call. What we do know is that people always respond for us doing great products and we feel really great about what we introduced last week. We also know that the deeper the Apps go in the enterprise, the more it opens up avenues in enterprise and that's a key part of the IBM partnership and what I think customers will get out of that, which is more important than our selling is changing the right people who work. And so I see catalyst going forward. There are obvious cannibalization; things that are occurring. I'm sure that some people looked at the Mac and iPad and decided on a Mac. I don\u2019t have research to demonstrate that, but I am sure that will be just looking at the numbers and I am fine with that by the way. I am sure that some people will look at an iPad and an iPhone and decide just to get an iPhone and I'm fine with that as well. But over the long arc of time, my own judgment is that iPad has a great future, healthy individual 90-day clicks workout, I don\u2019t know, But I'm very bullish on where we can take iPad over time and so we're continuing to invest in the product pipeline. We're continuing to invest in distribution. If you look at how we did in emerging markets like BRIC countries as an example, we were up 20% for the full year of '14. And so these numbers are impressive and obviously the BRIC countries are growing as a percentage of our total as is developing markets. And so, it looks a bit different geography to geography, and so that\u2019s a long answer to your question, but I thought it was important for you to at least share my perspective and you can judge it as you will.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS: Thanks.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Steve. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: And we'll hear from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays: Hey, thanks a lot. Tim, I was wondering what we were to make out of your new segments with the Apple Watch being in the other category. We were just a little surprised to hear that because it seems like such a substantial new category and you could sell may be even tens of millions of unit. So by putting it lumped in the other with iPods and a lot of other things, does that say something about your expectations for that product or do you think that you'll just break it out after a little while?\nTim Cook: Probably it says nothing about our expectation for the product. We didn't form those categories based on expectations. We looked at current revenue, today revenue, and decided that we would love everything that wasn\u2019t a Mac, an iPad, or an iPhone or a service in one kind of category. In the future, we might decide something different, but for now, in Q1 we're not shipping any iPhone or excuse me, Apple Watches and so it seems appropriate to start it that way. And also to be also straight is I am not very anxious in reporting a lot of numbers on Apple Watch because of the -- and giving a lot of detail on it because our competitors are looking for it and so aggregating it is helpful from that point of view as well.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays: Okay. Got it. And then with regard to my next question is you put out a lot of products and we obviously everybody gives you a lot of credit for the great new product lineup that we have, but everybody talks about what's next. You said in an interview recently on TV that you were working on products that people didn't even speculate on yet and that's pretty hard with Apple considering how many people watch your company and write about it. So I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that may be in terms of your excitement around new products and what did you mean by that comment and how do you feel about the future in light of that comment you made? Thanks a lot.\nTim Cook: I am incredibly optimistic about the future. We've already announced two new categories in the last 60 days or so or less than 60 days with Apple Pay and Apple Watch. So shipping the watch early next year and obviously we're working on other things as well and to the degree that I can keep that in the cone of silence, I am going to do it and so I am not sure what to say. I am not going to give any answer or anything. We look at a lot of different things and we're fortunate to have a lot of creative people here that want to change the world and have a lot of great ideas.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays: All right. Thanks Tim.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks. And could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Hey, good afternoon. A follow-up to Ben's question in terms of the last year you had higher expectations in terms of new product categories and the iPhone 6 launch but there are some investors who think about Apple and a products type of story. So Tim, I'd be interested in how you think about the story broadly in 2015 and kind of exciting things to be focused on as an investor and then I have a follow-up to Luca.\nTim Cook: Well for Apple if as an investor I would hope that people would look at what we've done and what we've delivered and the power and strength of the product line that we've announced and maybe more importantly then all the stuff that you see, is to look at the skills within this company. And the fact that I think it's the only company on the planet that has the ability to integrate hardware and software and services at a world-class level and that in itself allows Apple to play in so many different areas and so the challenge becomes one of deciding which ones to say no to and which ones to say yes to and want to focus not once -- not once do we have any great ideas and we always had more ideas than we have resources to deal with. And so I would look at that. I would look at what we talked about last week. Things like continuity and if you use your imagination and think about where that goes, there is no other company that can do this. Apple is the only one and I think this becomes so incredibly important moving forward for customers living in an environment where they're using multiple devices. And so I would look at the skills, the capabilities, the passion of the company and the creative engine has never been stronger. And I think you can see that from the Apple Watch, you can see that with Apple Pay. Apple Pay is a classic app for taking something that is incredibly old, outdated, kludgy. Everybody is focused on everything except for the customer and putting the customer at the center of the experience and making something very elegant. And so I would look at those things and when I look at those things, I would as an investor, I feel great, as a personal investor I feel great.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: No. That's helpful. And a follow-up for Luca, you mentioned that you have typical transition costs that involve in new products you're rolling out. Do those costs start to ease in the March quarter and would that presumably have a positive impact on gross margins in March versus December. Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, and you know pretty much what our product cadence is and what it's been in the past and you know that the holiday season is a period where we have significant product events and we're not providing any guidance for the March quarter. And also keep in mind Gene if you're trying to extrapolate gross margins into the future, there are so many factors that affect gross margin over time and it's not only transition cost, but its product mix, its foreign exchange, its commodity markets.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Okay. Great. Thanks. Congratulations.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Gene. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: And from Bank of Montreal, we'll go to Keith Buckman.\nKeith Buckman - Bank of Montreal: Hi, Tim, I was wondering if you could characterize China a little bit. The numbers I understand weren't as good as the rest of the company this quarter but presumably that was all the delay of the iPhone. So I'm really asking if you talk about the last few weeks and more importantly as you look at December quarter in particular related to some of the political backdrop including the carriers have been mandated not to spend the same level of subsidies. Do you see any of that impacting your opportunities for Apple broadly speaking but more specifically for iPhones as it relates to subsidy levels?\nTim Cook: That's a good question. If you -- if you just -- if you look at Greater China Q4 of '14 compared to Q4 of '13, the obvious difference is that we launched the 5s in Q4 of '13 and in this year, we didn't have a new product launch. We were launching in this quarter in Q1 of '15. The second thing that's not as apparent probably, but is more related to that is that last year we increased our channel inventory by $1.3 million. This year, we actually decreased it slightly. And so you have a compounded effect of their launch and a huge change in channel inventory on a year-over-year basis. So the way that I assess the strength of the market is I look at unit sell-through and to share with you what it was in Greater China, iPhone unit sell through despite no launch in Q4 was up 32% year-over-year. The market was projected by IDC to only grow 13%. So we feel incredibly great about that. Macs were up 54% year-over-year and that's against the IDC's estimate of the market contraction in China of 7% and so those are two stalwarts that were really driving results and so the underlying results look totally different than the reported results because of the channel inventory kind of differences. The App Store in China is also doing great. The growth there is phenomenal. iPad concreted some during the quarter, but for the full year we did grow -- we were up 9% year-over-year for the full year and so I see lots of positives. As you know China is on the early stages of their huge 4G rollout.\nKeith Buckman - Bank of Montreal: Yes.\nTim Cook: And this weekend -- this past weekend we launched it with China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. This was the first time we've launched a new iPhone with all three carriers and we've done it at the early stages of the 4G rollout and so I am incredibly bullish over it. In terms of subsidies there are regulatory pressures on subsidies. We have -- we've seen that. However, only 20% of the iPhones that we've been selling in China have had a traditional subsidy applied to it and so the vast majority don't. And so will it make a difference with that 20%, I don't know yet. Intuitively you were thinking, it would, but it's at least a percentage of a 20% instead of a percentage of 100%. And so when I look at China, I see an enormous market where there are more people graduating into the middle class than any nation on earth in history and just an incredible market where people brought the latest technology and products that we were providing. And so we're investing like crazy in the market. We're more than doubling our stores. We've got 15 in Greater China today. We're going to be close to 40 in the next couple of years. We've expanded our online store to cover now 315 cities in China. The revenue results for Q4 were up more than double the previous year. The App Store is growing. Chinese developers have now created a 150,000 apps -- of the apps on the App Store and so I see lots of very, very positive factors there and I couldn\u2019t be more excited.\nKeith Buckman - Bank of Montreal: Okay. And then as my follow-up if I could, Tim, you mentioned before on a previous comment on iPad where you saw I think 50% to 70% in the top six countries were new buyers and related to a previous question, wondered if you could give that same range. I understand it's probably a pretty wide range for iPhones and that was to the June quarter I think. And broadly speaking, how does that number change at least your guess as you look out over the next couple quarters given the launch of the 6 and the 6 Plus.\nTim Cook: For iPhone I really have it by model from the June quarter and as I had mentioned before, the highest percentage is the 4s buyer in China over 80% of the people were buying their first iPhone. And for a 5s in China, 50% were and so I think what that says. Those numbers are so high, the 80 that I think are great -- my gut tells me, a great percentage of 6 and 6 Plus buyers will eventually -- a great percentage of those will be new to iPhone. That's what I would predict.\nKeith Buckman - Bank of Montreal: Okay. That's it for me guys. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Keith.\nNancy Paxton: Thank Keith.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple CEO, Tim Cook; and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri, and then we'll open the call for questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2013, the Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2014, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s been a very busy and exciting time at Apple and I'd like to review some of the highlights of our June quarter. We hosted our best ever Worldwide Developer\u2019s Conference last month with over 20 million people from around the world watching our keynote session, which is the a record. We've had overwhelming response from customers and developers to the new features we previewed in OS X Yosemite and iOS 8. Yosemite has been redesigned with a fresh look and powerful new apps and iOS 8 is the biggest release since the launch of the App Store. With powerful continuity features, these upcoming releases will allow Macs and iOS devices to work together in even smarter ways. Customers can start on activity like writing an email on one device and pass it to another, picking up where they left off without missing a beat. They will even be able to make and receive iPhone calls on their Mac with just a click. These are features that only Apple can deliver. With iOS 8, we have opened over 4000 APIs providing more flexibility and opportunity for developers than ever before. iOS 8 provides developers with amazing new frameworks, enables wide use of Touch ID to securely authenticate users within apps and lets developers further customize the user experience with major extensibility features such as third-party keyboards. We have also introduced Swift, an innovative new programming language for both iOS and OS X. Swift is the result of the latest research on programming languages, combined with decades of experience within building Apple platforms. It makes writing code interactive and fun, eliminates entire classes of unsafe code and generates apps that run lightning fast. It's easy to learn, allowing even more people to dream big and create whole new categories of apps. We believe our new OS releases, combined with Swift will result in a huge leap forward for the Apple ecosystem and we can\u2019t wait to what developers will create with Yosemite, iOS 8 and Swift. When we introduced iOS 7 years ago, it was a revolutionary operating system for iPhone. Over the years we've extended it to the iPod family with iPod Touch and later to a tablet form factor with iPad. An explosion of apps, accessories and services for these devices has created an incredibly vibrant ecosystem. We\u2019re extending iOS in even more dimensions as customers around the world make iPhones and iPads an essential part of their lives, at home, at school, at work and on the go. We\u2019re putting a huge effort into delivering the best experience to our customers wherever they use iOS. That includes a safe and intuitive user interface for driving, called CarPlay, which is being integrated by 29 major car brands including Audi, BMW, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes, Toyota and Volvo; and after-market systems like Pioneer and Alpine. We\u2019ve created a new tool for developers called HealthKit, which allows health and fitness apps work to together and empowers customers to choose what health data they share. We're taking the first steps in this area in collaboration with the Mayo clinic, whose new apps can automatically receive data from a blood pressure app, for example and share it with a physician, or a nutrition app can inform fitness apps how many calories are being consumed each day. Our ARM health app will provide an easy to read dashboard of all health and fitness data. We're enabling new ways to control light and doors and thermostats and other connected devices around the house using Siri with the HomeKit feature of iOS 8. And in the Enterprise, we are including new security, productivity and device management features in iOS 8. We forged a relationship with IBM to deliver a new class of mobile business solutions to enterprise customers around the world. We are working together to provide companies access to the power of Big Data analytics, right on every employee's iPhone or iPad. Using Swift, we will collaborate to bring over 100 Mobile First apps to enterprise clients, each addressing a specific industry need or opportunity. This is a radical step for Enterprise and opens up a large market opportunity for Apple but more importantly, it\u2019s great for productivity and creativity of our enterprise customers. From the pocket to the car, to the workplace, home and gym, we have a very large vision of what iOS can be and we're incredibly excited about our plans. Turning to our financial results, today we are reporting record June quarter revenue, thanks to the very strong performance of iPhone, Mac and the continued growth of revenue from the Apple ecosystem. Our teams executed brilliantly during the quarter with earnings per share up 20% year-over-year, our highest growth rate in seven quarters. We sold over 35 million iPhones, setting a new third quarter record. We generated healthy growth in our entry priced, mid-tier and lead iPhone categories. I'm especially happy about our progress in the BRIC countries, where iPhone sales were up a very strong 55% year-over-year. We also had a record June quarter for Mac sales, with growth of 18% year-over-year in a market that is shrinking by 2% according to IDC\u2019s latest estimate. Demand has been very strong for our portables in particular and we've have had a great customer response to the new higher performance, lower priced MacBook Air. It was another strong performance for the App Store and the other services contributing to the thriving Apple ecosystem. In fact for the first nine months of this fiscal year, the line item that we call iTunes software and services has been the fastest growing part of our business. iTunes billings grew 25% year-over-year in the June quarter and reached an all-time quarterly high, thanks to the very strong results from the App Store. We're continuing to invest in our incredible ecosystem, which is a huge asset for Apple and a very important differentiator of our customer experience. iPad sales met our expectations but we realized they didn\u2019t meet many of yours. Our sales were gated in-part by a reduction in channel inventory and in-part by market softness in certain parts of the world. For example IDC\u2019s latest estimate indicates a 5% overall decline in the U.S. tablet market, as well as a decline in the Western European tablet market in the June quarter. But what\u2019s most important to us is that customers are enjoying their iPads and using them heavily. In a survey conducted in May by ChangeWave, iPad Air registered a 98% customer satisfaction rate, while iPad Mini with retina display received an astonishing 100% customer satisfaction rate. The survey also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 63% plan to buy an iPad and our own data indicates that more than half of customers purchasing an iPad are buying their very first iPad. Another recent study by Custora found that iPad accounts for 80% of all U.S. tablet based e-commerce purchases. We're very bullish about the future of the tablet market and we're confident that we can continue to bring significant innovation to this category through hardware, software and services. We think our partnership with IBM, providing a new generation of mobile enterprise applications, designed with iPad\u2019s legendary ease of use and backed by IBM\u2019s cloud services and data analytics will be one such catalyst for future iPad growth. Looking ahead, we are very excited about our agreement to purchase Beats Electronics and Beats Music. We think its part of Apple\u2019s DNA and we think the addition of Beats team will be great for music lovers. Beats provides Apple with a fantastic subscription music service, access to rare talent and a fast growing line up of products that we can build upon. Not counting Beats, we've completed 29 acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal year 2013 including five since the end of the March quarter and we have brought some incredible technology and more importantly some incredible talent into Apple in the process. We are hard at work and investing heavily on exciting opportunities across our business and we have an incredible pipeline of new products and services that we can\u2019t wait to show you. With that I would like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our Q3 results in more detail.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. We set a new June quarter record for revenue at $37.4 billion, up $2.1 billion or 6% year-over-year. This result was towards the high end of our guidance range, despite a reduction in channel inventory for both iPhone and iPad. The revenue growth was driven by strong sales of iPhones and Macs, as well as the continued great performance of iTunes softwares and services. Gross margin was 39.4%, above our guidance range and operating margin was $10.3 billion, representing 27.5% of revenue. Net income was $7.7 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $1.28, a 20% year-over-year increase. For details by product, I'd like to start with iPhone. We sold 35.2 million iPhones, an increase of 4 million over last year, representing 13% growth. As Tim mentioned, iPhone sales grew well across all three of our entry-price, mid-tier and lead product categories. In the U.S., iPhone accounts for 41.9% of the smartphone subscriber base according to the latest data from ComScore, up from 41.3% in the previous measurement period. Also based on the latest survey by ChangeWave, iPhone earned a 97% customer satisfaction rate and among responders planning purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 50% planned to purchase an iPhone, up from 42% in the March quarter and 44% a year ago. iPhone sales were at the high end of our expectations, despite new product rumors that we believe resulted in purchase delay. In addition, tax increases and the regulatory environment in Japan affected smartphone sales in what has been one of iPhone\u2019s fastest growing markets in recent quarters. Considering these factors, the performance of iPhone was even more impressive in the June quarter and it boosts our confidence for the future. We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 150,000 from the end of the March quarter, leaving us within our target range of four to six weeks. Apple continues to innovate through hardware, software and services to make iPhone the best smartphone for business. Today, companies have equipped millions of employees with iPhones and they are seeing tremendous benefits in productivity, employee satisfaction and profitability. For instance medical device leader Medtronic has developed over 175 internal iOS apps for over 16,500 iPhones used by its employees to facilitate sales, improve productivity and ensure that essential marketing materials are up to date. Throughout the global offices of Nestle, the largest food company in the world, over 25,000 iPhones are accessing corporate networks, improving communication and connecting employees to critical internal resources. And at NASA over 26,000 iPhones are in use by scientists, flight crew members, technicians and researchers. Turning to iPad, we sold 13.3 million units, compared to 14.6 million in the June quarter last year. iPad sales grew overall in the developing markets with particularly strong year-over-year growth in the Middle-East, where iPad sales were up 64%, in China where they grew 51%, and in India, where they were up 45%. This growth was more than offset by lower sales in more mature markets. We reduced iPad channel inventory by 500,000 from the end of the March quarter, which left us within our target range of four to six weeks. In the Enterprise, global companies are using iPad to improve customer service, boost work and productivity and enhance critical processes. iPad continues to be the standard for teams across the airline industry. Qantas Airlines has over 15,000 iPads deployed to pilots as well as cabin, customer service and ground crews to enhance key processes across the daily operations and governments are deploying thousands of iPads worldwide. One of the largest examples is Sweden, where over 100,000 iPads are being used by local government offices across the country. In education, iPad remains the tablet of choice with 85% share of the U.S. education tablet market according to the latest published estimate from IDC. We\u2019ve now sold 13 million iPads to education customers globally. We\u2019re bringing teachers and students great new tools to build an experience educational count into an iPad. As of this month, teachers using the free iTunes U app can create, edit and manage entire courses that are on iPad for the first time and students can discover new ways to collaborate, including the ability to start class discussions and ask questions right from their iPad. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.4 million Macs, compared to under 3.8 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year and a new June quarter record. The increase was driven by portables, thanks to very strong growth of MacBook Air. We achieved strong double digit Mac growth across many countries, including the U.S. Canada, Mexico, the UK, Germany, France, Australia, China, India and the Middle-East. This growth is particularly impressive, given the contraction of the overall PC market. Macs have now gained global market share for 32 of the last 33 quarters. Macs performed well in the U.S. education buying season with double-digit growth in the K to 12 market, driven primarily by large deployments of MacBook Air. The Shawnee Mission School District in Kansas chose Apple to provide an entire solution that will equip every teacher with a MacBook Air and an iPad Air, every high school student with a MacBook Air and every middle school and elementary student with an iPad. The Rowan-Salisbury School System in North Carolina is deploying thousands of MacBook Airs to students and teachers in grades 9 to 12 as part of the district's digital learning initiatives. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range. The Apple ecosystem continues to grow and thrive. Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.5 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Our iTunes stores generated all time record billings of $5.4 billion in the June quarter, up 25% year-over-year, driven by very strong growth in App Store sales. These items billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of almost $2.6 billion, up 8% from the year ago quarter. Software and services revenue was $1.9 billion, up 19% from a year ago. App Store momentum remains very strong and cumulative app downloads has topped 75 billion. We continue be amazed by our vibrant and diverse developer community and we are extremely proud that our developers have now earned over 20 billion for sales of their apps through the App Store, nearly half of which have been earned in the past 12 months. This number truly stands out among our competition as our developers continue to benefit from the broad reach and powerful design of the App Store, coupled with Apple\u2019s large, loyal and very engaged customer base. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $164.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $13.9 billion. Our domestic cash was $26.8 billion at the end of the June quarter, a sequential increase of $8.3 billion and $137.7 billion or 84% of our total cash was offshore. Cash flow from operations was $10.3 billion. We executed another very successful debt offering in April, issuing a total of 12 billion in notes across 3, 5, 7, 10 and 30 year maturities. In addition, during the quarter, we entered the commercial paper market for the first time with $2 billion in short-term obligations outstanding as of the end of June. We also continued to execute our shareholder return program with $8.3 billion of capital returned to inventors during the June quarter. We spent $5 billion to repurchase 59 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We paid almost $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and utilized over $400 million to net share settle vesting employee RSUs. We've now taken action on over $74 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $51 billion in share repurchases with six quarters remaining to its completion. And finally our Board has declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on August 14, 2014 to shareholders of record as of record as of August 11, 2014. Now as we move ahead into September quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $37 billion and $40 billion, compared to $37.5 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $4.75 billion and $4.85 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.1%. Finally, we expect the Beats transaction to close this quarter and we expect the acquisition to be accreted to our earnings in our fiscal 2015. With that, let me open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please. Operator, may we have the first question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). And your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Luca, this is the third quarter in a row that gross margin came in above your guidance. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that gap and why you expect the margin to come down sequentially in the September quarter?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Katy, it was obviously a surprise also to us. We were expecting obviously a loss in leverage from the sequential declining revenue which obviously happened. We also expect that some unfavorable mix, which also happens -- it's typical as we move away from the launch quarter. And we were expecting some cost improvements. These cost improvements came in. They came in stronger than we were anticipating. The commodity markets continue to be favorable, the product quality continues to be excellent, our teams executed really, really well. And all these things came together at the same time and it was a very nice surprise for us. As we look forward into Q4, yes, we\u2019ve guided to 37% to 38%. Again, the mix is the normal mix that we see as we continue to move through the product cycle. And obviously in Q4, we got some transition costs because we\u2019re expecting a very busy fall. We're bit excited about what we've got in the pipeline. And that\u2019s the reason why we guided to that range.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley: And then just a follow-up on that last point, because in the press release you referenced the excitement about new products and services. Can you remind us of your guidance philosophy as it relates to product cycles? Do you embed assumptions around the contribution from new products? And if so, do those tend to be more conservative than for products that\u2019s already shipped today?\nLuca Maestri: So our guidance, Katy is that -- we put our numbers that we believe at this point in time with all the information that is available to us, we're going to land within. So we take into account the fact that we\u2019ve seen some purchase delays for executing Q3, but we have seen some safe trends in certain geographies. That continues to happen. And what you see this quarter is that our guidance range is $3 billion, as opposed to $2 billion during the third quarter, just to take into account the fact that we got many moving pieces.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you Katy. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we will hear from Bill Shope.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: With the pockets of market we just noted for tablets, could you give us some more detail on how you are thinking about the category longer term, and in particular in the context of your usage comments, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape now and how that may evolve? And then I guess, related to that, what do you think to be the next driver of renewed growth for the category?\nTim Cook: It\u2019s Tim. If you sort of back up from this, the category that we created, which has just been a little over four years, we have now sold 225 million iPads, which is I think probably a larger number than anyone would have predicted at the time and including ourselves, quite frankly. We still feel that category as a whole is in its early days and that there is also significant innovation that can be brought to the iPad and we plan on doing that. When I look at the top level numbers, I get really excited when I see that more than 50% of the iPads that we're selling are going to someone who is a first time tablet buyer. I get excited when I see that our retail share according to the MPD in the month of June was 59% of UNIX and over 70% in terms of dollars. And of course, Luca has mentioned in his preamble that our education share is 85%. We also are in the -- virtually all Fortune 500 companies, we are in 99% of them to be exact and 93% of the Global 500. However, when we dig into the business market deeper, though our market share in the U.S., in the commercial sector is good at 76% -- this is according to IDC; the penetration in business is low. It\u2019s only 20%. And to put that in some kind of context, if you looked at penetration of notebooks in business, it would be over 60%. And so we think that there is a substantial upside in business. And this was one of the thinkings behind the partnership with IBM that we announced last week. We think that the core thing that unleashes this is a better go to market, which IBM clearly brings to the table, but even more importantly apps that are written with Mobile First in mind. Not all but many of the enterprises apps that have been written for iPad have been essentially ports from a desktop arrangement and haven\u2019t taken full advantage of mobile. And so we're excited about bringing that to business along with partnering with IBM, which we think is a first class company. And seeing what that can do to sales of business, which I honestly believe the opportunity is huge. The market is still predicted in 2018 -- I think these are Gartner numbers -- to be about 350 million in size and put that in some context, I think the PC market right now is about 315 million. And so I think our theory that has been there honestly since the first time that we shipped iPad, that the tablet market would eventually surpass the PC market, that theory is still intact. I just think we have to do some more things to get the business side of it moving in a faster trajectory and I think we're now on to something that can really do that. So as I look at it and sort of back up from the 90 day clock kind of thing, I'm incredibly excited. I'm excited about the plans that we have on the product side and also on the go to market side, and in particular the IBM announcement. One other point I might add on this, because I think this is interesting. I don\u2019t think it came out in our commentary so far as; the market's very bifurcated on iPad. In the BRIC countries, iPad did extremely well. The growth was very high. Like in the China it was in the 50%s, in the Middle East it was in the 60%s. Luca may have mentioned those numbers. In the developed countries like the U.S., the market is clearly weaker there. It\u2019s interesting to note however that the U.S. as an example, we had a very, very strong Macintosh market in the U.S. and so there is probably a bit of higher add kind of stuff beginning to play out too, where higher add is clearly still very much notebook oriented. K12 on the other hand, we sell 2.5 iPads for every Mac in the K12. And so we're clearly headed into that season now and it typically starts in graduation time prime in fiscal Q3 for us. And so I think that\u2019s probably another thing that we're seeing.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: One more question if I could. You've had obviously great performance in the BRIC countries and you've touched on China for few categories. Can you talk about the overall demand environment you saw for China in the quarter? Obviously there's some seasonal factors to consider but how should we think about your performance versus your expectations and how you are thinking about it for the rest of the calendar year?\nTim Cook: China, honestly was surprising to us that it was -- we thought it would be strong but it well went past what we thought. We came in at 26% of revenue growth, including retail and if you look at the units, the unit growth was really off the charts across the board. I found 48% off that compares to a market estimate of 24%. So growing it two times the market. iPad was up as well, as I've mentioned before. The Mac was up 39% and that\u2019s versus a market in China that\u2019s also contracting along with markets in most parts of the world and China was projected to contract by 5%. And so we're seeing some substantial strength there and the thing that\u2019s actually growing the most is the iTunes software and services category, which has the App Store and et cetera and that area is almost doubling year-over-year. And so it\u2019s very, very exciting what we're seeing there. We are still in the process of rolling out along with our partner China Mobile, the TD-LTE into more cities and we're still in early going on that. That just started in January as you know. And my understanding is that later this year there will be a license for the other operators to begin shipping FDD-LTE, which I think is another big opportunity in China.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Bill. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: Next we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca, I wanted to revisit the gross margin question. You talked about guidance for next quarter, that the drivers of the sequential decline being a normal mix through the cycle on transition cost. Your guidance to the midpoint is down 190 basis points in gross margin, last year in Q4 gross margins were up 10 basis points sequentially in fiscal Q4 and the product transition issues or cycle issues that you alluded to seem essentially identical. So I'd like to try and understand what might make this Q4 different let\u2019s say than last Q4?\nLuca Maestri: If I understand the question, also when you look at it in terms of absolute levels of gross margin, last year it was 37%. So our range is above that level. There is obviously many, many things that affect us in different ways from one year to the other. Foreign exchange is a case where a lot of the emerging market currencies and the yen and the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar, they have been weaker against the U.S. dollar. That has an impact on margin. And also when you think our product cycle, I think we don\u2019t get into the specifics but this is not exactly the same cycle as we've had a year ago.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: I mean is it better? If we look back two years to the iPhone 5, your product margins were down 260 basis points sequentially. So is the reference there that we should be thinking in terms of changes that are more akin to what we saw two years ago rather than to this year?\nLuca Maestri: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily draw that analogy. I think we need to start thinking from the fact that we had a very, very strong Q3. A lot of things came together extremely well. 37% to 38% is a range that is -- we think is very good, and that\u2019s where we are right now and we still have several weeks in the quarter.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: Tim, I wanted to get your input on the impact of trade-in programs for the iPhone, particularly in mature markets where they are most prevalent. As best I can tell, if I look at the last four quarters, they're not hyper-focused on 90 days. It looks like the iPhone has been about flat in unit terms in the Americas and up low single digits in Europe and I think Europe includes India, which is obviously very fast growing. So perhaps low single digits in Europe. So if we look at those western geographies, we've seen relatively flattish iPhone unit sales over the last year. I know you don\u2019t report it but just sort of based on overall revenue reporting, I'm wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of iPhone trade-in programs and this is four quarters, still over a complete cycle. Whether you think they are elongating or shrinking and what impact is very prevalent, increasingly prevalent trade-in programs might be having on them and what impact your pricing of older generation devices might be having on them.\nTim Cook: Yes, the theory that you have Toni is not precisely correct. Like if I look at Europe, the operating segment of Europe for quarter or year-to-date for 2014 versus the same period last year, iPhone units were actually up 10%. Your more macro question; what I understand to be your macro question of do I think there is some sort of cannibalization going on trade-in programs on new product sales? What I think is happening in the aggregate if you look across the world is that trade-ins are actually hugely beneficial for our ecosystem because people wind up -- we have more people that are able to join the party when we have a trade-in, because in essence, it winds up being used by -- probably the prime example someone else within the family or in the example that has become more common in the last year, someone trades it in and then that goes to either somebody else in that country that is very price sensitive or somebody in a different country and I see all of this as good. In looking at how much of it cannibalizes, it is very hard to answer that question with any degree of preciseness. But my gut is that the cannibalization factor is low, because you wind up having -- you wind up attracting people that are much more price sensitive in there. I think the great thing is that our products command a much higher resale value than others do. And so that leads to a larger trade-in and from my perspective, that being the larger ecosystem, more people that wind up getting on iPhone, and as you know from following us for quite some time, if we get somebody to try an Apple product and then buy an Apple product, the likelihood that they begin buying other Apple products that may be in different categories or upgrading to one in that category and the future is very high. And so net-net, I view it to be positive. It\u2019s very difficult to quantify with certainty.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From UBS, we will hear from Steve Milunovich.\nSteve Milunovich - UBS: Tim you mentioned that Japan was fairly flat due to regulations and taxes. Could you elaborate on that and what kind of comparisons perhaps you see going forward?\nTim Cook: Yes, it was actually Luca, but I can comment on it. VAT was increased from 5% to 8% close to the beginning of the quarter. I think it was actually April 1 or so. That was the first planned VAT increase. There are other or at least one additional planned VAT increase in the future. This was a part of the overall tax reform package in Japan. Secondly, the carriers received some guidance from the regulators to essentially stop incenting people to transfer from another carrier at a higher amount than they were incenting their -- retaining their own customers. And so it appears that the combination of these two things dampened the whole market for smartphones in Japan. We haven\u2019t been able to get very detailed data on share but my expectation is we're not going to see very much of a share change. And we are beginning to see some coming back of that market as we step into this quarter, may be not back to the level that it was previously but you can begin to see the market growing again which we view as very positive. In the past when we've seen these type of things, tax changes et cetera, there is usually a rush to buy before the tax increase, a pause that happens thereafter and then the market eventually goes back to some kind of steady state that may not be exactly where it was but it nears it. And so I think that\u2019s likely our guts or that\u2019s what happens on the VAT side. The other piece is a little harder to conclude what will happen in terms of that guidance and how long that might be employed. I don\u2019t know that part.\nSteve Milunovich - UBS: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then you talked about your three tiers of iPhones. I wonder if you would be willing to breakout in any more detail the growth and particularly how to defend the 5C in the mid-tier. I know our surveys continue to find in the U.S. that it's falling little bit as a percentage of business but you seem to believe it\u2019s doing exactly what you expected it to do.\nTim Cook: I can tell you this. That if you look at the growth rates, we don\u2019t divide out each one but if you look at year-over-year growth rates and so this would be comparing the 5C to last year. It would be comparing the 4S, which was in the mid-tier. The growth in that sector was the highest growth during the quarter we just finished.\nSteve Milunovich - UBS: Of the three tiers?\nTim Cook: Of the three tiers. And so we are extremely happy with how it performed last quarter.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Steve. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.\nKulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse: Thanks. I have just one question for Luca and one for Tim. And for Luca, you mentioned that commodity pricing, I guess the environment was good for you. Is it your working assumption in your guidance that continued to be favorable and a tailwind for you? And then my question for Tim is, with the installment plans that are being introduced in the U.S., I imagine that given the increases in flexibility for people to operate faster, would you expect that to happen? Are you seeing any evidence as these contests come up because we've had them out now for several months? And how do you see that impacting your business because obviously the U.S. iPhone part of your business is still very significant and it can be quite a big catalyst to your iPhone business going forward I would imagine or would you be more tensed in how these are playing out?\nTim Cook: I will take both of these. This is Tim. On the component question, what we saw in the June quarter was that NAND, mobile DRAM and LCD, the pricing on all of those declined, while PC DRAM increased, despite the market for PCs contracting. In the September quarter, what is factored in our guidance is that LCDs and mobile DRAM continue to decline, that NAND pricing remains essentially flat last quarter and that PC DRAM has a slight price increase. And in terms of other commodities that I didn\u2019t talk about, we've assumed that they would decline at historical rates and so that\u2019s factored into the gross margin guidance that Luca gave you. In terms of the installment plans that you mentioned in the U.S. relative to iPhone, there is a lot of different models that are being tried in the U.S. and throughout the world. And actually last quarter, as we estimated and this is subject to estimating but we're estimating that less than one out of four iPhones were sold on a traditional subsidy plan. And so that number is markedly different than it would have been two years ago. The installment plan that you're speaking about which gives the customer the right to upgrade SAP or faster than a usual two year cycle, we think that plays to our customer base in a large way. And so that makes us incredibly bullish that customers on those plans would be very likely to upgrade when we announce a new product.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Kulbinder. May we have a next question please?\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays: Thanks a lot. Tim, questions for you. I guess during the quarter you did two very big things in our opinion, obviously buying Beats, biggest acquisition in your history and you also did this IBM deal, which obviously was in this quarter, but since the last call, and that was very interesting, obviously really collaborating with another huge company to get further into the enterprise. And I was just wondering, what are you seeing in Apple that\u2019s changing? These seem like big deals that change your direction a bit, something that you wouldn\u2019t have done in the past. And do you see a lot more partnerships and larger acquisitions on the horizon to grow your TAM in various markets?\nTim Cook: Well, I think we have a lot of really great people and I think we have the capability. As I've said before, I think we have the capability to acquire a sizable company and manage it. And relative to IBM, I feel the same way. I think you can only do so many partnerships well, and so it is unusual that we enter into a partnership. But in this particular case, I think arguably the companies are so complementary, and I've gotten to know Gini fairly well over the last couple of years and I think we see the importance of the customer, a lot of the same way and both feel that Mobile and Enterprise is just an enormous opportunity. And we\u2019re not competing with each other. And so I think a partnership in that case is particularly great. Would we do more of either of the things we did? We\u2019re always looking in the acquisition space, but we don\u2019t let our money burn a hole in our pocket and we don\u2019t do things that aren\u2019t strategic. And so with Beats we felt we were getting an incredible subscription service, a very rare set of talent that we think can do great things in Apple and access to a very fast growing businesses in their headphone and earphone space. And culturally we felt there was a match and music has been deeply embedded in Apple\u2019s DNA for many, many years. And so it was a great marriage and I think the partnership with IBM is a great marriage as well. It\u2019s more like that, presented themselves -- or I think we can manage more things. I think that we have a very, very strong executive team and can do that. But it\u2019s not my goal to acquire certain number of companies or spend a certain amount of money. We want to do things that help us make great products that are great for our customers and so forth.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays: I am sorry, just really quick on the IBM. Does this say something about Apple doing more in Big Data, and taking a cut maybe of some of the analytics opportunities as well?\nTim Cook: Yes, we didn\u2019t talk about how the business model is going to work. But generally speaking, I think that each of us have revenue streams in the enterprise and each of us went from having those revenue streams. So that\u2019s how I look at that. And we win if we can drive that penetration number I spoke about from 20% to 60%. That would be incredibly exciting here. The walls would shake. And so that\u2019s what I hope for.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you Ben. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We will hear from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.\nBen Schachter - Macquarie: Tim, I just wanted to talk about the app market for Enterprise. Right now I believe that app developers can sell to the enterprise directly and therefore that they can bypass sharing revenue from these app sales with Apple. Is Apple going to allow that to continue, and can you also just more broadly discuss how Apple thinks about the opportunity to sell apps directly to the enterprise?\nTim Cook: We have no plans to change the rules with Enterprise. Some enterprises like proprietary apps that they do not want to offer to others and so we obviously have a way for them to distribute those into their enterprise or just the employees that they want to and so I'm not worried about changing that. We\u2019re also taking friction out of the system and not adding it. Again, the big thing for us is getting the penetration number, I think getting our product, iPhones and iPads and Macs in more people hands and we think there is a huge opportunity in Enterprise to do that.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you Ben.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first today are Apple CEO, Tim Cook, and Vice President and Corporate Controller, Luca Maestri, and they will be joined by CFO, Peter Oppenheimer for the Q&A session with the analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consists of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, stock-based compensation expense, taxes, future products and capital allocation plans. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2013, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2014, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy D. Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to share with you over the next hour, and I\u2019d like to start right away with the very strong results we\u2019re reporting for the March quarter. We generated $45.6 billion in revenue, which was ahead of our expectations and represents a new March quarter record, and is our strongest non-holiday quarter ever. Our underlying business performance was even stronger than our reported results imply. When you take into account changes in channel inventory this year versus last year and foreign exchange had wins that we faced in several of our international markets. Setting foreign exchange and inventory changes aside, our underlying growth rate would have been close to double digits. These strong revenue results combined with our best gross margin percentage since September of 2012 resulted in earnings per share growth of 15%, which is our highest earnings growth rate in the last six quarters. iPhone was key in driving our stronger-than-expected results. We sold almost 44 million iPhones, setting a new March quarter record. These stronger results were broad-based both from a product point of view with demand for each of our three iPhone stronger than its predecessor and from a geographic standpoint. We gained smartphone share in many developed and emerging markets including the U.S., the UK, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Vietnam and Greater China, just to mention a few. In fact, we established a new all-time record for total iPhone sales in the BRIC countries. iTunes software and services revenue continue to grow at a double-digit rate, thanks to an incredible ecosystem and our very large, loyal and engaged customer base. With its strong momentum in growing profitability, iTunes is a very important driver of our business not only here in the United States, but around the world. We now have an almost 800 million iTunes accounts, most of these with credit cards. This is a staggering number. We continue to gain share in the personal computer market as well. We defied industry trends again by growing while the market contracted. Our bold decision to make OS X free has resulted in the largest ever percentage of the Mac installed base running on the latest version of the operating system just months after its release. iPad sales came in at the high end of our expectations, but we realized they were below analyst estimates, and I would like to proactively address, why we think there was a difference. We believe almost all of the difference can be explained by two factors. First, in the March quarter last year, we significantly increased iPad channel inventory, while this year we significantly reduced it. Luca will go into more detail about this later. Second, we ended the December quarter last year with a substantial backlog with iPad mini that was subsequently shipped in the March quarter, whereas we ended the December quarter this year near supply demand balance. We continue to believe that the tablet market will surpass the PC market in size within the next few years and we believe that Apple will be a major beneficiary of this trend. When we look at our company performance on a geographic basis, we\u2019re especially proud of our very strong results in Greater China, where we established an all time quarterly revenue record of almost $10 billion including the results from our retail stores. And in Japan, where revenue was up 26% in spite of the foreign exchange headwinds and where our smartphone market share reached an incredible 55%. We are continuing to invest in our retail stores and since our last call, we had opened our first stores in Brazil and Turkey and we now have retail stores in 15 countries around the world. I\u2019m looking forward to welcoming our new retail and online leader, Angela Ahrendts, who will be joining Apple\u2019s Executive Team next week. Stepping back, we are now just passed the halfway mark for fiscal 2014. Our strong March quarter results bring us to total revenues of over $103 billion for the first six months of the year and earnings per share growth close to double-digits. We estimate that over the last six months, we\u2019ve added over $60 million new registered users of our four product categories. Additionally, over two-third\u2019s of people registering an iPad in the last six months, were new to iPad, while over half of the people registering iPhones were new to iPhone. It is wonderful to add tens of millions of first time Apple product users, especially considering the strong halo effect, we\u2019ve seen over and over again in our history. Customers who have a great experience with their first Apple products, often become loyal and happy owners of the multiple Apple products overtime. As always, I\u2019d like to thank our talented employees who make these results possible through their creativity and passion they bring to their work everyday. And I\u2019d like to thank our hundreds of millions of customers for their loyalty and enthusiasm and for continually inspiring us to surprise and delight them. In addition to our quarterly results, we are also announcing an update to our capital return program today, and I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts about our guiding principles for capital allocation and our conclusion on the changes we are making for this year. Apple has created tremendous value for shareholders by developing great products that enrich people\u2019s lives and that will always be our top priority and driving force. We\u2019ll continue to innovate by investing in research and development and capitalizing on our strengths in hardware, software and services. We\u2019ll keep investing in our supply chains promote scale and efficiencies, expanding our global presence by building retail stores, investing in marketing and distribution and extending our reach into new markets. We are expanding Apple\u2019s products and services into new categories and we are not going to under invest in this business. We are also investing through acquisitions and we\u2019ve acquired 24 companies in the past 18 months. To invest organically and to make acquisition strategically, we need to maintain financial flexibility. With this framework in mind, Apple\u2019s Board and management team, will do capital allocation regularly and we solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. We very much appreciate all of the input that so many of our shareholders have provided us on how the best to deploy our cash. We\u2019ve continued to seek investor input going forward and we\u2019ll update you on our conclusions around this time each year. This regular process allows us to continually evaluate return of capital in light of the most current information available and it enables us to be thoughtful about the size, mix and pace of the program. We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to shareholders. We started doing so two years ago when we announced our first program of $45 billion and we more than doubled the program last April to $100 billion. Today, we are announcing that we are increasing the size of our program once again with an addition of over $30 billion for a total program size of over $130 billion. The size and pace of our program is unprecedented and we still expect to complete it by December of 2015 as we announced last year. We think very deliberately about how much and in which way to return cash to our shareholders. We decided to continue to allocate the vast majority of the incremental capital return to share repurchases because we believe our current stock price does not reflect the full value of the company. The size of the share back increases the signal of the Board and the management team\u2019s strong confidence in the future of Apple. We also understand the importance of the dividend to many of our investors and we are increasing it for the second time in less than two years. We believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value income and we are planning for annual dividend increases going forward. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Luca for the details of our quarterly results as well as more information about our capital return program.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you Tim and good afternoon everyone. As Tim said revenue for the March quarter was $45.6 billion, up $2 billion or 5% from a year ago and above our guidance range. Sales in each of our major product categories were at the high end of our expectations or better and the vast majority of the revenue upside came from strong sales of iPhone. Gross margin was 39.3%, also above our guidance range and operating margin was $15.6 billion, representing 29.8% of revenue. Net income was $10.2 billion translating to diluted earnings per share of $11.62. For details by product, I\u2019d like to start with iPhone. We sold 43.7 million iPhones which was a March quarter record. That\u2019s an increase of 6.3 million iPhones over last year that represents 17% growth. The addition of China Mobile coupled with great response to our more affordably priced iPhone 4S led to an all time quarterly record for iPhone sales in Greater China. We look forward to broadening our relationship with China Mobile as they expand points of sale and continue to build out their 4G network. In Japan, iPhone sales were up over 50% year-over-year resulting in significant market share gains, as Tim mentioned we\u2019ll try strong growth and share gains in many other major developed markets based on IDCs latest estimates for the March quarter. iPhone also continued to perform exceptionally well in many developing markets. In Greater China, Brazil, Indonesia, Poland and Turkey. iPhone sales grew by strong double-digits year-over-year, and in India and Vietnam sales more than doubled. We exited the quarter with 15.4 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represents a sequential increase of about 100,000 from the December quarter and left us within our target range of four to six weeks. In the enterprise market progressive organizations are leading the charge to replace legacy devices and systems, and are using iPhone and iOS to drive innovation at their companies. Deutsche Bank has nearly 20,000 iPhones running on its network and has created 40 internal apps that extend the capabilities of its mobile workforce. Siemens have 30,000 iPhones on its network and has deployed over 50 internal apps for field service teams, sales associates and corporate executives for solution that are only possible with iOS and iPhone. We are really happy with the continued growth and strength of the Apple ecosystem. Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.6 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year at an all time quarterly record. Our iTunes stores generated record billings of $5.2 billion in the March quarter, up 24% year-over-year driven by very strong growth in App Store sales. These iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over $2.6 billion, up 9% from the year ago quarter, and also a new all-time record. Software and services revenue was over $1.9 billion, up 14% from a year ago. App Store momentum is incredibly strong as cumulative app downloads at 70 billion, 87% of iOS devices are now running iOS 7 and our highly engaged users are a great audience for developers. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 85% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter despite the differences in unit market share between iOS and Android devices. Now, I\u2019d like to talk about the Mac. We saw 4.1 million Macs compared to just under 4 million in the year ago quarter. Thanks to strong performance from MacBook Pro and MacBook Air and Macs have now gained global market share for 31 of the last 32 quarters. Response to Mavericks has been great, and we are very proud of the fact that so many of our Mac customers are taking advantage of the most advanced and secured experience possible. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range. Turning to iPad, we saw 16.4 million units. As Tim explained earlier, our iPad results and the comparison to the March quarter last year were heavily influenced by channel inventory changes. Specifically, this year we saw 16.4 million iPads into our channels and sold through almost 17.5 million reducing our channel inventory by 1.1 million units. Last year we sold over 19.4 million iPads into our channels and sold through 18 million and therefore increased channel inventory by 1.4 million units. As a result, the year-over-year sell through decline was only 3% compared to the sell in decline of 16%. We exit the March quarter with 5.1 million units of iPad channel inventory, which left us within our target range of four to six weeks. iPad continues to lead all other tablets by far in terms of user engagement, size of ecosystem, customer satisfaction and e-commerce. A recent study by Chitika Insights found that iPad users in North America generate almost four times the web traffic of all Android tablet users combined. In a February survey, ChangeWave measured a 98% customer satisfaction rate for both iPad Air and iPad Mini with Retina display. And also found that among people planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days two-thirds plan to buy an iPad. iPad continues to allow companies around the world to reimagine the way they use technology to drive efficiency and improve employee satisfaction. Thousands of iPads are used at FedEx everyday. In an industry where efficiency is critical FedEx pilots and maintenance crews around the world use iPad to transform operational processes and save the company millions of dollars. Eli Lilly has deployed over 20,000 iPads and 50 internal apps as part of a laptop replacement program that dramatically increased the productivity and capabilities of its employees. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is on its way to deploying iPads to 11,000 providers to transform the way doctors and patients interact. As part of this initiative, a suite of applications is being developed to allow quick access to real-time secure medical information. In education, according to the latest data published by IDC, iPad has over 95% share of the U.S. education tablet market as teachers and students increasingly benefit from the growing range of engaging iBooks, textbooks and solutions that are helping to transform the education experience. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $150.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decline of $8.3 billion. Our domestic cash was $18.4 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential decline of $16 billion and $132.2 billion or 88% of our total cash was offshore. Cash flow from operations was very strong at $13.5 billion for the quarter. In total, we executed almost $21 billion worth of capital return activities during the March quarter. First, we launched our third accelerated share repurchase program in late January through which we will acquire an additional $12 billion of Apple stock. We received an initial delivery of 19.2 million shares under this ASR and we received a balance of shares due when the program concludes by December of this year. Second, we paid $2.7 billion in dividends in February. And finally, we spent $6 billion on open market purchases of 11.4 million shares throughout the March quarter. At the end of March, we also settled our second ASR program, which was launched in April of last year, resulting in the retirement of an additional 1.1 million shares. I would like now to go into more detail about the expansion of our capital return program that we\u2019re announcing today. Let me start by summarizing the progress that we\u2019ve made on the program we updated a year ago. By the end of March 2014, we\u2019ve already taken action of $46 billion of the current $60 billion share repurchase authorization, over 75% of the program with seven quarters remaining to its completion. We have acted aggressively and opportunistically and have delivered on our intention to return capital to shareholders at a fast pace. Including dividends and net-share-settlements, we\u2019ve taken action on $66 billion of total $100 billion program announced last year. Today we\u2019ve taken additional steps that will increase the overall size of the program from $100 billion to over $130 billion within the same timeframe of December 2015 as before. There are two elements to the expansion of the program. First, we\u2019re increasing the size of our share repurchase authorization from $60 billion to $90 billion. We are very confident in Apple\u2019s future, and we believe our current stock price does not reflect the full value of the Company. That\u2019s why the vast majority of our capital program continues to be allocated to share repurchases. We will also continue to net-share-settle, restricted stock units and expect to utilize about $1 billion of cash annually for that purpose. Second, our Board has declared a dividend of $3.29 per common share payable on May 15, 2014 to shareholders of record as of May 12, 2014. That represents an increase of about 8% in our quarterly dividend. We understand the importance of dividend increases to many of our investors, and we\u2019re increasing the dividend for the second time in less than two years. We are planning for continued annual increases and we\u2019re very proud that Apple is one of the largest dividend payers in the world, with annual payments of $11 billion. All our capital return activities must be funded by domestic cash which as I mentioned was about $18 billion as we exited the March quarter, and down from $39 billion in the quarter that we paid our first dividend. We would maintain sufficient domestic liquidity to grow the business and execute capital expenditures and acquisitions. Thanks to Apple\u2019s strong growth in international expansion in recent years. We have built substantial offshore cash balances to repatriate our fall in cash on the current U.S. tax law, we will incur significant cash tax consequences and we don\u2019t believe this would be in the best interest of our shareholders. We continue to advocate for comprehensive corporate tax reform and streamlining the tax code which we believe would be of great benefit to the U.S. economy. To execute our updated capital return program in a tax efficient manner and leverage our very strong balance sheet, we intend to access the debt markets again. We plan to be active in both the domestic and international bond markets during 2014 for an amount of term debt financing similar to what we issued in 2015, with a break down between markets currencies and tenures to be determined over the course of the year and subject to prevailing conditions in each market. We have also prepared ourselves to access the commercial paper market given the substantial short term liquidity and flexibility that this channel can provide. Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $36 billion and $38 billion compared to $35.3 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion. We are continuing to invest heavily in R&D for current revenue generating categories as well as future products and services. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.1%. And now, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Tim.\nTimothy D. Cook:\n : Finally, before we start the Q&A, I would like to take a minute to talk about my dear friend and colleague Peter Oppenheimer. As you know, Peter will be transitioning from the CFO role in June. Peter has been Apple\u2019s CFO for 10 years and the list of his accomplishments is immense. Apple is now more than 20 times the size it was when Peter became our CFO and his expertise, leadership and incredibly hard work had been instrumental to the company\u2019s success. I\u2019d like to thank him very publicly for his contributions to Apple, from the very bottom of my heart and wish him all the best in his approaching retirement at the end of September. And I\u2019d also like to recognize him that he has never missed guidance in the 10 years as CFO which must be an all-time record for CFOs. We\u2019re really happy and fortunate to have someone with Luca\u2019s talent on Board to replace Peter. He has over 25 years of experience, building and leading finance teams in global companies and has an exceptionally broad international background, which you might be able to detect from his accent. He\u2019s been managing most of Apple\u2019s financial functions since coming on Board last year and has done an outstanding job. I\u2019m looking forward to working with Luca even closer as Apple\u2019s next CFO. With that, I\u2019d like to open the call for questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Tim. We\u2019d like to ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please. Operator, may we have the first question.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Congrats on the great quarter. Tim, if I heard you right that $800 million account is a staggering jump from the last time you reported that number and yet iTunes, software and services growth decelerated again this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about your view on the importance of better monetizing the installed base in the future? And then I have a follow-up.\nTimothy D. Cook: Keep in mind, in that category there\u2019s several things, not just the App Store kind of revenues and so if you looked at App Store only, it would look a little different than what you\u2019re seeing. But in terms of your question about monetization, I do believe that we can monetize more than we owe from a services point of view in existing areas and in new areas. And I\u2019m particularly encouraged that when I look at the App Store and how it\u2019s doing the strength was broad based. And in fact in China the growth was in the triple digits.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then question the around iPhone ASPs, just looking at the trend iPhone 5s, demand has surprised to the upside over this cycle. Does that give you any confidence that Apple could actually charge more for highly innovative products in the future or does the strategy remain to add innovation at the same price as previous versions of a product?\nTimothy D. Cook: We price things that we think \u2013 are priced in such a way that we think it\u2019s a fair price for the value that we\u2019re delivering and we make those on each thing as it gets closer time to come to market.\nKaty Huberty \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Peter, much luck to you.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thanks, Katy.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs we\u2019ll hear from Bill Shope.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks. Can you walk through the key drivers of the June quarter gross margin guidance off of what was admittedly very sharp upside for the March quarter.\nLuca Maestri: Sure. Bill, I\u2019ll take that. So March quarter was very good as you said. There were three seasons for it. We had obviously better volume as you\u2019ve seen from our revenue results. We had better cost than anticipated, and we had some favorable mix of both products and services. As we get into Q3, obviously as you\u2019ve seen from our revenue guidance we are expecting some loss of leverage, which would come from the sequential decline in revenue. It\u2019s about 19% at the midpoint of the range, and we\u2019re also expecting less favorable mix. This is something very typical that happens to us as we move farther away from the quarter when we launched the new products. To offset that, it's only going to be a partial offset. We will have some cost improvements.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Then looking at the iPhone upside for the March quarter, obviously, it looks like China was a key driver here, but within the U.S., did you see as much pressure from the changes in U.S. carrier upgrade policy that you had discussed last quarter, and was demand I guess just strong enough to completely counter that? And then is this headwind behind us now, and potentially a tailwind in the U.S. as we head into the June quarter?\nTimothy D. Cook: We saw some pressure in the quarter because of the stricter enforcement of upgrade policies. So this was primarily in the U.S. as I mentioned last time. But if you really look at iPhone, the strength of iPhone was very broad-based and as I've mentioned, we gained share in a whole host of markets, from developing markets like the U.S., U.K., France, Germany to more of the emerging markets like China, Vietnam, and had the largest total sales of iPhone in the BRIC countries that we've ever seen in our history. And so we feel very good about that the strength was broad-based.\nBill C. Shope \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Bill. Could we have the next question please.\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Yes. Thank you. Peter best wishes going forward. I have one question for Luca and a follow-up for Tim please. Luca, on the iPhone ASPs this quarter, they were down a little over $40. I think that was the largest sequential decline that we've seen in history. I was wondering if you could help us understand what drove that. Was it entirely mix? You mentioned good growth in each of the three models, but were you seeing particularly strong growth in the 4s? I think you mentioned that in China. And how significant if any was selling older generation for iPhone 4?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Toni. When you look at the $41 of decline, I would say about half of that was driven by the fact that we have continued to do very well in emerging markets with the 4s. I have mentioned that there is a lot of markets where we've grown very strongly in Latin America, in Asia-Pacific, in Eastern Europe. So, about half of that decline came from the stronger sales of the 4s. And then the rest was primarily the fact that, again as we move away from the quarter where we launched a product, we tend to have lower capacity mix in our numbers.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Okay. Tim, I was wondering if you could talk about how you think about replacement cycles generally for the iPhone over the longer term. Clearly U.S. carriers have started introducing plans that may ultimately encourage people to keep their phone longer than two years, because their total price paid is less. And so one could argue and I'd like your opinion on whether you think that could push out replacement cycles. I guess, the other consideration is the imperative for Apple to continue to introduce really great products to want to have people upgrade at the same frequency. And I guess, the dilemma in doing that is as we've seen with the 5 and with the 4 is introducing really great products, typically puts pressure on your BOM and pressures margin. So perhaps you could just tell us how you think conceptually about where you think replacement cycles go over time and why? And then secondly, how do you address this dilemma of well in order to make a great phone it typically costs more to do so and managing their potential margin pressure.\nTimothy D. Cook: There is a lot there, let me see if I can address it quickly and I want to just add one thing to the point that you asked Luca. Just to be clear on the iPhone 4 question, we sold a very, very low single-digit percentage of those and so it had extremely minimal impact of results on the quarter. In terms of the general upgrade or the installed base, some of the programs that the carriers are running may serve to increase the upgrade cycle because there are some areas where customers can pay a bit more in the beginning and have the ability to essentially upgrade each year. So I think there is some that work that way. I think there is some that work the way that more of the way that you're leaning, and how these balanced are very difficult currently to conclude. But regardless of how those balance, what I see as the bigger opportunity for Apple is that the smartphone market is still only 1 billion or so units and it will eventually take over the entire mobile phone market. We've seen our ability to attract new users to iPhone to be very significant in the emerging markets. We were seeing new to iPhone numbers on the iPhone 4s sales in the 80 percentages in certain large geos. So, this to us give us a great comfort that we can continue to grow and we may not be able to attract some of those buyers to our top phone because of the price point. But if we can get them in on the entry iPhone, it gives them a great product, at a great value and gets them into the ecosystem. And as you know from following us for a while, our ability to keep customers is very good and our ability to show other products that Apple produces to a family that's buying Apple product is also very good. And so, at the macro level, I see the opportunity of the market and getting more people into the Apple ecosystem much larger than any of the noise around the different carrier plans, some of which I think helped, and some of which I think worked the opposite way and it's completely unclear to me how those net. It's probably also important to know that the bulk of the things you're seeing in the U.S. are not occurring in many of the other geos in terms of the upgrade policies and so forth. I mean, each country has its own kind of cadence associated with this, and the U.S. is \u2013 it\u2019s in the 30% of our business, not 100%. So it\u2019s important to weigh it with a proper perspective.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Okay. And any comments on the latter part of that around, sort of the imperative to continue to come out with really great products that ensure people have an incentive to upgrade, yet when we\u2019ve seen you really revolutionize phones between iterations we\u2019ve seen margin pressure?\nTimothy D. Cook: The most important thing, Toni, that we do is to make great products that really get our users excited to want the next one and that will always be the case. And you can bet that that\u2019s where the vast majority of all of our attention is on doing this thing. In terms of the BOM pressure of any new product, you have seen in the past that exists. I think you\u2019ve also seen that we have a way of working down the cost curve. That was certainly very key in achieving the 39.3% gross margin from this past quarter. And as I said before, we price things at a level that is fair for the value that we are providing, and so we\u2019re certainly not stuck on certain price points. We price that values that are fair for the value that we are delivering.\nToni Sacconaghi \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Tony. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: And from UBS we\u2019ll hear from Steve Milunovich.\nSteven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Tim, I understand that the iPad is not as weak as it appears on a sell-through basis, but still it\u2019s relatively flat over the last year in terms of sell-through. What are your thoughts in terms of why that is and can that accelerate with Office on the iPad going forward?\nTimothy D. Cook: It\u2019s a good question. Let\u2019s talk about iPad a little more than we did in the comments. When I backup from iPad, here\u2019s what I see. It absolutely has been the fastest growing product in Apple\u2019s history and it\u2019s been the only product that we\u2019ve ever made that was instantly a hit in three of our key markets, from consumer to business including the enterprise and education. And so, if you really look at it in just four years after we launched the very first iPad, we\u2019ve sold over 210 million, which is more than we or I think anyone thought was possible at that period of time. And it\u2019s interesting to note that that\u2019s almost twice as many iPhones that we\u2019ve sold in a comparable period of time, and over seven times as many iPods as we\u2019ve sold in the period of time. So, I think it\u2019s important to kind of to put that in perspective. We\u2019ve come a long way very, very quickly. Looking at it by market a bit, which I think is important. I think Luca mentioned a little bit of this in his comments. In the education market in the U.S., we have a 95% share. And so the focus in education is on penetration, is on getting more schools to buy and my belief is the match has been lit, and it\u2019s very clear to the educators that have studied this is that student achievement is higher with iPad in the classroom than without it. And so I\u2019m confident we\u2019ve got a really great start in education far beyond the U.S. now. This is happening in many, many parts of the world. In the enterprise market, we\u2019re seeing virtually all, 98% of the Fortune 500 that using iPad. And we\u2019re seeing, according to Good Technology who looks at activations of tablets, the latest data we have from them is that 91% of the activation of tablets in enterprise were iPads. And so this is also an astonishing number and many of those enterprises are writing apps that are key proprietary apps for running that business, and this is great for that company because they\u2019re more productive as a result of that. And so once again, just like in education in a way, what we have to do in enterprise is focus on penetration. It has to be deeper and broader. But in terms of having people begin the process, beginning writing apps, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of that. In the retail market, if you look at the U.S. as a proxy, the NPD numbers for March just came out a few days ago and we had 46% share and embedded in that 46%, there\u2019s a lot of things in there that I personally wouldn\u2019t put in the same category as iPad and that are weighing the share down. It\u2019s certainly a market we wouldn\u2019t play in and a type of product you would never see an Apple brand on. So we feel like we\u2019re doing well there. Office, I believe does help. It\u2019s very unclear to say how much. I believe if it would have been done earlier, it would have been even better for Microsoft frankly. There is a lots of alternatives out there from a productivity point of view, some of which we brought to the market, some of which many, many innovative companies have brought. But I do see that Office is still a very key franchise in the enterprise, in particular. And I think having it on iPad is good, and I wholeheartedly welcome Microsoft to the App Store to sell Office. Our customers are clearly responding in a good way that it\u2019s available. So, I do think it helps us particularly in the enterprise area. The other things you look at on iPad that are just blow away as customer sat is 98. There is almost nothing in the world with a 98% customer sat and the intention to buy numbers look good with two-thirds of the people planning to buy a tablet or planning to buy an iPad. The usage numbers are off the chart, far and exceeding Android tablets, four times the web traffic of all Android tablets combined. And so, when I backup from all of these, I feel great. That doesn\u2019t mean that every quarter, every 90 days is going to be a number that everybody is thrilled with. But what it means to me is that the trend over the arc of time that things look very, very good, that iPad has a great future. And of course the thing that drives us more than any of this are the next iPads if you will, the things that are in the pipeline, the things that we can do to make the product even better and there is no shortage of work going in on that nor any shortage of ideas. And so when I backup from all of this, I can\u2019t help but still be extremely excited about where we are. I think we did a reasonable job of explaining what we think the disconnect was between what we had expected, which we hit it at the high end of our expectation and the street's view of this one. I believe the vast majority of it is that first thing was just channel inventory that maybe we should have been even clearer on last quarter to take into account. But I'm very bullish on iPad.\nSteven M. Milunovich \u2013 UBS Securities LLC: Okay, very complete thank you. One other question, when you look at Google and Amazon and Facebook, they've very much diversified their business over time in a way that one has rarely seen. Apple, sort of the opposite. People say you ought to buy this or that and you'll do acquisitions, but you're obviously very focused. Is that because it's just a management philosophy of wanting to be more focused than some of these other companies? Or is there something about Apple's products that particularly being more hardware oriented that kind of prevents you from saying, yes, let's go make TV shows or let's go often do something else, even though you probably have the money and the technical capability to do all these things?\nTimothy D. Cook: The key thing for us, Steve, is to stay focused on things that we can do best and that we can perform at a really high-level of quality that our customers have come to expect. And so we currently feel comfortable in expanding the number of things we're working on. So we've been doing that in the background and we're not ready yet to pull the string on the curtain. But we've got some great things there. We're working on them. Very, very proud of and very, very excited about. But for us, we care about every detail and when you care about every detail and getting it right, it takes a bit longer to do that and that's always been the case, that's not something that just occur. As you probably know from following us for a long time, we didn't ship the first MP3 player, nor the first smartphone, nor the first tablet. In fact, there were tablets being shipped a decade or so before then, but arguably, we shipped the first successful modern tablet and the first successful modern smartphone and the first successful modern MP3 player. And so it means much more to us to get it right than to be first. I think you can see so many examples out in the marketplace, where it's clear that the objective has been to be first. But customers at the end of the day don't care about that. That's not what they look for from Apple. They want great, insanely great and that's what we want to deliver, and so that's the way we look at it. From an acquisition point of view, we have done 24 in 18 months. That shows that we're on the prowl, I suppose you could say. We look for companies that have great people and great technology and that fit culturally. And we don't have a rule that says we can't spend a lot or whatever. We'll spend what we think is a fair price. What's important to us is that strategically it makes sense and that it winds up adding value to our shareholders over the long haul. We are not in a race to spend the most or acquire the most. We're in a race to make the worlds' best product that really enrich people's lives. So, to the tune that acquisitions can help us do that and they've done that and continue to do that, then we will acquire it. And so you can bet that you will continue to see acquisitions and some of which we'll try to keep quiet and some of which seems to be impossible to keep quiet.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Cross Research, we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross.\nShannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC: Thank you. First I just want to tell Peter, thank you very much, we've really enjoyed working with you over the past 10 years. But then secondly, in terms of a question for Tim, can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape for smartphone? If you look at some of your competitors seem to be have cut prices fairly quickly in the most recent product cycle, perhaps faster than before. You've got Microsoft about to close on Nokia. Lenovo is buying Motorola, there is a lot going on from a sort of competitive standpoint. So I'm curious as to how you're seeing the market?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, there is a lot of moving parts, a lot of acquisitions, a lot of people giving up to some degree and deciding to do other things. But at the end of the day we see it much like we've always seen it, as the part of the market that we're interested in is the market of people that really want the best smartphone and that doesn't mean that they're all at the high end of the price stand. I mean, we have smartphones that go down to a very affordable price with the 4S because we're proud to ship that product. I think that this quarter, if you were unsure, hopefully this quarter demonstrates to you that we can do well in a number of geographies from emerging markets to develop markets. Some of the numbers that we've experienced just to quote some of the more historic prepaid market through the first half of 2014; Brazil was up 61%, Russia was up 97%, Turkey was up 56%, India was up 55%, Vietnam was up 262%. I could go on, but the point is that there's a number of markets out there where we are beginning to really catch on to a number of customers, and I am particularly proud of the results in these markets because these have not been historic strong points for Apple. We've been working at China for a while and have learned a lot and I'm very proud of what we've done there. But I think some of these other numbers I just read demonstrates that we're beginning to have really nice success outside of there as well.\nShannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC: Great and then, if you can just, actually as a follow-up on the China side, I think it grew at 13% year-over-year, and you mentioned obviously China Mobile has been the driver of that. But can you talk about some of the other categories as well, and perhaps some of the other carriers in terms of where you're seeing demand out of China?\nTimothy D. Cook: Yes, really great question. We did have an all-time revenue record in Greater China, just under $10 billion at $9.8 billion. iPhone sales were up 28%, that's versus the IDCs market forecast of 20% growth. So we gained share. Mac units were up double-digit, in particular they were up 13%, and that's far outpacing IDCs PC market forecast of a negative 8%. So we gained share there as well. If you look at the iTunes software and services revenue in China, we more than doubled it. Year-over-year, we were in the triple digits percentages. And if you look at iPad and you take out the channel inventories, ins and outs and look at demand instead of sell in, we grew by 6% and that compares to IDC\u2019s forecast of a flat tablet market in China for last quarter. And so we literally did well in every single area in China. It wasn\u2019t just because we were able to come to an agreement with the world\u2019s largest carrier. That was certainly key, but as you can tell from the rest of these numbers there are other things going on. Also, I\u2019d mentioned this briefly with Steve, but I think it\u2019s important to point out that if you look at some of the numbers we\u2019re seeing on first-time iPhone buyers, people that bought the iPhone 4s, 85% were first-time iPhone buyers, and the 5c, 69% first-time iPhone buyers. So these are extraordinary, and as you would expect, these are also heavily Android switchers. 62% of the people that bought the 4s switched from Android. 60% of the people that bought the 5c switched from Android. And so we\u2019re incredibly pleased with this. For the first half, including our retail stores, Greater China revenue topped $19 billion. So this is a 21% year-over-year, and is our fastest growing region. So, we\u2019re looking at this data and deciding to continue investing in a big way. We plan to triple the number of Apple Retail Stores over the next two years. We\u2019re continuing to expand in online. We\u2019re continuing to build out channels. We\u2019re up to 40,000 points of sales now in iPhone, but we\u2019re not nearly where we need to be on the rest of our product line and even the 40,000 is a low number in considering the broad landmass and the number of folks in China. And so, I feel like there\u2019s still loads of opportunity there, and feel really, really good about how we\u2019re doing.\nShannon S. Cross \u2013 Cross Research LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: And from Piper Jaffray we got Gene Munster.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Hey, good afternoon and I\u2019ll add congratulations to Peter on itinerary for the record there. And Tim, I want to talk a little bit about some of your comments at the recent shareholder meeting. You mentioned that Apple TV is no longer a hobby. Wanted to hear a little bit about why you made that distinction? And separately, it would be interesting to hear your feedback on the HBO Amazon announcement today and what you think that means, if anything, in terms of some content partners being a little more \u2013 work with some more players like yourself? Thanks.\nTimothy D. Cook: Good questions, Gene. The reason that I stripped off the hobby label is that when you look at the sales of the Apple TV box itself, and you look at a content that was bought directly off of Apple TV for 2013, that number was over $1 billion. And so, it didn\u2019t feel right to me to refer to something that\u2019s over $1 billion as a hobby. Also from an investment point of view, we continue to make the product better and better. And so it doesn\u2019t feel right from that point of view either. We had HBO GO already on Apple TV and you have to authenticate in order to use it, but you have to do that with Amazon service as well from my brief read of their announcement. I think they in addition to that got some older content from HBO to put on there. I haven't had a chance to evaluate exactly what it is and don't have a personal point of view on that yet. But if I look broadly at the content on Apple TV, I think it compares extremely favorable to the content that is on the Amazon box. We've sold now, Gene, about 20 million of the Apple TV, and so we've got a pretty large installed base there. And I'm feeling quite good about that business and where it can go.\nGene Munster \u2013 Piper Jaffray: Excellent, thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook: You bet.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Gene.

I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Peter Oppenheimer for introductory remarks.\nPeter Oppenheimer: Thank you, Nancy. We\u2019re very pleased to report the results of the first quarter of Apple\u2019s fiscal year \u201914. We established new all-time quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales and had one of our best Mac quarters ever, driving the highest quarterly revenue and operating profit in Apple\u2019s history. We were also very pleased with our results in emerging markets around the world. Revenue for the quarter was $57.6 billion, up $3.1 billion, or 6%, from the year ago quarter and near the high end of our guidance range. No technology company has ever generated that much revenue in a single quarter, and we\u2019re especially pleased to have generated that record despite foreign exchange headwinds, the year over year decline in iPod sales, and the higher revenue deferral rates from iOS devices and Macs that we discussed last quarter. These three factors negatively impacted revenue by about $2.5 billion, and without them, our year over year revenue growth would have been about 10%. Gross margin was 37.9%, above the high end of our guidance range, and operating margin was an all-time record of $17.5 billion, representing 30.3% of revenue. Net income was $13.1 billion, translating to diluted earnings per share of $14.50, a new record. As for the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to begin with iPhone. Despite supply constraints on iPhone 5S, we sold 51 million iPhones compared to 47.8 million in the year ago quarter. That\u2019s an increase of over 3 million phones, or 7%, and a new quarterly record. iPhone sales growth was very strong year over year in Japan, thanks to the addition of NTT Docomo in September and our continued partnership with Softbank and KDDI. In fact, based on the latest data published by Kantar, iPhone accounts for 69% share of the smartphone market in Japan. We also generated strong year over year iPhone growth in greater China, Latin America, the Middle East, and Russia. In the U.S. market, Apple remains the leading smartphone manufacturer, with iPhone accounting for 41% of smartphone subscribers in the three-month period ending in November, according to ComScore. We\u2019re very pleased to have reached a multiyear agreement with China Mobile, the largest network in the world, with over 750 million customers, and to be selling iPhones through their expansive network of stores, beginning on January 17. China is an incredibly important market to Apple, and iOS devices already account for 57% of all mobile web browsing in China. iPhone customers are loving their phones, and continue to produce the highest loyalty rates in the industry. A December survey of U.S. customers by ChangeWave indicated a 96% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone. And based on the latest data provided by Kantar, iPhone customers have a 90% loyalty rate, significantly higher than the competition. We exited the quarter with about 15.3 million total iPhones in channel inventory, which represented a sequential increase of less than 1 million units from the September quarter, and left us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. The release of new iPhones with iOS 7 introduced powerful new security and management features for business and enterprise customers. And iOS 7 has received FIPS 140-2 certification from the U.S. federal government. These features, coupled with ease of developing custom enterprise apps, continue to make iPhone the device of choice for large organizations. Many companies, including Accenture, Cisco, and American Airlines, have tens of thousands of employees using iPhones for work. In fact, some, including Deloitte and GE, have over 50,000 iPhones each on their networks around the world. And based on the latest data published by IDC, combining business, government, and education institutions, iPhone has a 59% share of the U.S. commercial smartphone market. Turning to iPad, despite supply constraints, we sold over 26 million iPads during the quarter, compared to 22.9 million in the year ago quarter. That\u2019s an increase of over 3 million iPads, or 14%, and represents a new all-time quarterly sales record. iPad sales were very robust in Mainland China, where sales more than doubled year over year. We also experienced strong iPad sales growth in the Middle East, Latin America, Russia, and parts of Western Europe. Customers are loving the new iPad Air and iPad Mini, with Retina Display, introduced in October, and response to the more affordable iPad Mini has been very strong. In fact, a November ChangeWave survey of customers planning to buy a tablet within 90 days found that 72% plan to purchase an iPad. And among customers who already owned an iPad, the survey measured a 97% satisfaction rate. We exited the quarter with 6.2 million units of iPad channel inventory, a sequential increase of about 2.1 million units, which placed us within our target range of 4 to 6 weeks of iPad channel inventory. Based on the latest data published by IDC, iPad has a 78% share of the U.S. commercial tablet market, and iPad continues to spark innovation for businesses around the world. Leveraging custom developed and App Store apps, progressive IT organizations have embraced mobility, armed employees with iPad, and fundamentally changed the way people do their jobs. British Airways has deployed thousands of iPads to their employees across the business, including senior cabin staff, engineers, check-in staff, pilots, and ground crew. At Kindred Healthcare, iPads are now being used by the sales team, executives, and thousands of therapists nationwide, resulting in millions of dollars of estimated savings and productivity gains for Kindred and their customers. And this football season, nearly every team in the NFL use iPads as playbooks, replacing their traditional three-ring paper binders. In the education market, schools continue to choose iPad and the great content available across apps, books, and courses. To date, U.S. educational institutions have purchased over 7 million iPads. In fact, we\u2019ve sold over 750,000 iPads to K-12 schools in the state of Texas alone, including 7,000 iPads rolling out to all K-12 students in the Midway Independent School District. We have expanded the availability of iBook textbooks in four countries to over 50 countries, so that students and teachers around the world can experience the power of what a textbook can be. We continue to add new titles from key education publishers like Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press. In addition, nearly 25,000 books have been created and published by individual educators using iBooks Author, bringing lessons to life in exciting new ways. And over 1,000 institutions are delivering courses and content through iTunes U. At the Ohio State University, where there are over 20,000 iPads on campus, faculty have developed over 70 iTunes U courses in less than one school year. We remain very focused on providing a great user experience for our iPhone and iPad customers, and we\u2019re extremely pleased that the iOS platform continues to lead the industry in user engagement. According to IBM\u2019s Digital Analytics Benchmark, iOS devices accounted for more than twice the online traffic and more than five times the online sales compared to Android devices on both Black Friday and Christmas Day. IBM reported that iOS devices represented 32.6% of online traffic on December 25, and more than double the 14.8% for Android. While iOS devices drove 23% of online sales that day, 5x the 4.6% for Android. And, according to the latest reports by TechInsights, iPhone accounted for 54% of North American smartphone web traffic, while iPad accounted for 78% of tablet traffic. These usage percentages are far greater than the share of the smartphone and tablet markets represented by our devices, and they underscore just how engaging and important our iPhones and iPads are to the people who own them. We\u2019re also very pleased with our customers\u2019 adoption of iOS 7. As of this month, 80% of iOS devices are running iOS 7. That dwarfs the single-digit adoption percentage measured for the latest version of the Android operating system, and makes iOS 7 the most popular operating system in the world. The rapid transition to the latest version of iOS provides a more advanced and secure experience for our customers, and a more streamlined opportunity for our developers. Turning to Mac, we sold 4.8 million Macs, compared to 4.1 million in the year ago quarter, an increase of 19%, making this among our best Mac quarters ever. The growth was driven by significantly increased sales of iMac and Macbook Air, while sales of Macbook Pro also remained strong. Mac sales grew in each of our operating segments, led by Europe and greater China. We were also very pleased to have generated such strong results for our Mac products, particularly given IDC\u2019s most recently published estimate of a 6% year over year contraction in worldwide personal computer sales. Macs have now gained global market share for 30 of the last 31 quarters. We were happy to begin selling the all-new Mac Pro last month, manufactured in the U.S., and we had great customer response to OS X Mavericks, now available for free and running on millions of Macs around the world. And we were also delighted to be providing our groundbreaking iWork productivity apps for free of charge to our Mac, iPhone, and iPad customers. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory that was within our 4-5 week target range. 30 years ago this week, Apple launched the Macintosh. Not only was the Macintosh a breakthrough for the personal computer, it was also a promise that the power of technology taken from the few and put in the hands of everyone could change the world. Over the past 30 years, people have done extraordinary things with the Mac, and with the Apple products it inspired. To coincide with the 30 year mark, we\u2019ve taken a look at what people have accomplished on a special website that showcases their Mac stories. Their achievements are a result of Apple\u2019s continued commitment to create and deliver the best technology to people all over the world, every day. Happy Birthday, Mac. Imagine what we can accomplish in the next 30 years. We continue to be very pleased with the growth of iTunes software and services and the strength of the Apple ecosystem. Total revenue from iTunes software and services was $4.4 billion, an increase of 19% year over year. Our iTunes stores generated record billings of $4.7 billion in the December quarter, thanks primarily to strong growth in App Store sales. The quarter of iTunes billings translated to quarterly iTunes revenue of over $2.4 billion, up 14% from the year ago quarter, and a new all-time record. Software and services revenue was about $2 billion, up 26% from the year ago quarter, and also a new record. We achieved these records despite the fact we are now making iPhoto, iMovie, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote free with new iOS device purchases, and we\u2019re also making Mavericks, iLife, and iWork free to our Mac customers. As we mentioned last quarter, we are now deferring a greater amount of revenue for each new iOS device and Mac sold as a result of the free software and associated upgrade rights. At the end of the quarter, our total deferred revenue from all sources was $11.4 billion, and we expect to realize $8.4 billion of it in the next four quarters. The App Store now offers 1 million apps in 24 categories and cumulative downloads have surpassed 65 billion. Our app developers earned 2 billion from sales in the App Store in the December quarter. That translates to $15 billion in cumulative App Store earnings for our developers, about half of which was generated in the last four quarters, and we are thrilled with the success that they have achieved. In China specifically, we have an incredibly vibrant iOS and Mac developer community. Developers in China have created over 130,000 apps on the App Store to date. A recent study by Business Insider Intelligence indicated that iOS has a 5x advantage over Android when it comes to developer revenue per app download, a 4x advantage in revenue from in-app purchases, and a 2x advantage in revenue from paid downloads plus in-app purchases. And according to a recent report from Distimo, the App Store has a 63% to 37% market share advantage over Google Play in global revenue from apps. Top developers continue to launch their apps first, or exclusively, on the App Store. Examples of highly successful launches from 2013 include Temple Run 2 and Cut The Rope 2, which generated millions of downloads in multiweek periods of App Store exclusivity. NaturalMotion recently launched Clumsy Ninja exclusively on iOS and saw 10 million downloads in the first week. And Plants Versus Zombies 2 resulted in the biggest game title launch ever for Electronic Arts\u2019 Pop Cap, with 16 million downloads from the App Store in the first five days alone. With the introduction of iOS 7, developers are able to create stunning apps to take advantage of the redesigned user interface and more than 200 new features and APIs. And many of the App Store\u2019s biggest recent successes, including Candy Crush Saga, Puzzle & Dragons, Minecraft, QuizUp, and Clumsy Ninja, were created by international developers. The seamless integration of the iOS platform, the global reach of our ecosystem, our thoughtful app review process, and our highly engaged customers continue to make the App Store a superior marketplace for our extremely talented developer community. I\u2019d now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $7 billion, a new quarterly record, and in increase of 9% from the year ago quarter. The growth was fueled by record iPhone and iPad sales through the stores as well as strong Mac sales. We completed the remodel of six stores and opened four new stores during the quarter, ending with a total of 420 stores, including 166 outside the United States. With an average of 418 stores open during the December quarter, average revenue per store was $16.7 million, compared to $16.3 million in the year ago quarter. Retail segment income was $1.7 billion. We hosted 114 million visitors to our stores during the quarter, which translates to almost 21,000 visitors per store, per week. We were excited to roll out iBeacon technology at our stores in the U.S. during the quarter, enabling shoppers to receive iPhone notifications about products and services via the Apple Store app. iBeacon transmitters use Bluetooth wireless technology to sense a shopper\u2019s exact location inside an Apple Store and send messages based on the aisle or product the customer is near. For example, customers walking by an iPhone table could receive a message offering to help them check their upgrade eligibility or trade-in value of an existing phone. We expect to see many innovative uses of iBeacon technology from other businesses and developers in the coming months, including retailers and professional sports. Total company operating expenses were $4.4 billion, and included $572 million in stock based compensation expense, aligning with $246 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%. And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $158.8 billion in cash or short term and long term marketable securities, a sequential increase of $12 billion from the September quarter. Our domestic cash was $34.4 billion at the end of the December quarter, a sequential decline of $1.1 billion. $124.4 billion, or 78%, of our total cash was offshore at the end of the December quarter, and cash flow from operations was $22.7 billion. We paid $2.7 billion in dividends in the quarter, and we executed an additional $5 billion in repurchases of 9.6 million shares of Apple stock during the quarter. This brings us to a cumulative total of over $43 billion in payments for dividends and share repurchases over the last six quarters, of which share buybacks were $28 billion. This has resulted in Q1 retirement of 56.5 million shares and represents 6% of the total shares outstanding prior to the launch of the repurchase program. Our board of directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share, payable on February 13, 2014, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 10, 2014. Now, as we move ahead in the March quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $42 billion and $44 billion, compared to $43.6 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%, reflecting approximately $110 million related to stock based compensation expense. We expect opex to be between $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion, including about $590 million related to stock based compensation. We are continuing to invest heavily in R&D, in both current revenue generating categories as well as future products and services. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.2%. In closing, we are very pleased with our record iPhone and iPad sales, the strong performance of our Mac products, and the growth of iTunes software and services revenue. We are thrilled to have the most satisfied, loyal, and engaged customers in our industry, and we are confidently working to make the user experience even better for them. We are continuing to invest heavily in our future, and remain very confident in our new product pipeline. With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Peter. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator instructions.] First, we\u2019ll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Peter, revenue guidance embeds a sequential decline that\u2019s bigger than what you experienced in the March 2013 quarter, and I think implies iPhone units may not grow in the March quarter year on year. So can you just talk about what\u2019s driving the cautious view on the top line for March?\nPeter Oppenheimer : The biggest reason for the larger sequential decline in revenue this year relates to changes in channel inventory between the years. And I\u2019ll go through some detail, but let me actually do it on a year over year basis. I\u2019d like to go through some things about the guidance, and I think you\u2019ll see that the underlying performance of our business is stronger than what the guidance might imply. We expect four factors to negatively impact the year over year revenue comparison by over $2 billion. These are channel inventory increases in the year ago quarter that we don\u2019t expect to repeat, lower iPod sales, a stronger U.S. dollar against a number of currencies, particularly the yen and the Australian dollar, and the higher per unit deferral for Mac and iOS devices that I talked about in my prepared remarks. Let me go through these a little more. First, beginning with channel inventory, in the March quarter last year, we increased channel inventory for both iPhone and iPad, whereas this year we increased the channel inventory for both product families in the December quarter, and we exited within our target range of channel inventory. For iPhone, specifically last year, the supply of iPhone 5 was short for the entire December quarter, and we were not able to achieve supply and demand balance for iPhone 5 until the March quarter. As a result, we increased the iPhone inventory last year by about 1.1 million units. In contrast, this year we executed the fastest rollout for our new iPhones, and we included China in wave one, in the launch in September, and we were able to exit the quarter in supply and demand balance. For iPad, we introduced the Mini in the December quarter last year, and we were not able to meet demand in any week of the quarter. We didn\u2019t reach supply and demand balance for the iPad Mini until the March quarter last year, and we increased inventory in the March quarter by 1.4 million units. In contrast, this year we exited the December quarter near supply and demand balance. So looking past the inventory changes year-to-year, we expect the value of the underlying sell through to grow year over year, and we\u2019re very confident in what we\u2019re shipping. Turning to iPod, sales declined by 52% year over year in the December quarter, and we would expect them to continue to decline year over year in the March quarter. And FX is a headwind for us with the strengthening dollar against a number of currencies. So when you consider these factors, we\u2019re very pleased with the underlying performance of the business and the revenue growth is stronger than what the guidance might imply.\nKaty Huberty - Morgan Stanley : And Peter, you\u2019re guiding OpEx flattish sequentially, despite the big revenue downtick. Are there any one-time items in SG&A and R&D in the March quarter? Or is the run rate reflective of investments for future opportunities?\nPeter Oppenheimer : It\u2019s definitely the latter, and let me have Luca take you through some details.\nLuca Maestri : Yes, at the midpoint of the range of our guidance, we are expecting a minor decrease of $50 million. This is largely due to the lower variable expenses that we\u2019re going to have, in line with the seasonal sequential decline in revenue. But one thing that Peter already mentioned in his remarks is that we continue to invest very heavily in R&D. We make investments in areas that are visible to all of you today, but also in areas that are not visible, which we\u2019re very excited about. And for the things that are not visible to you, obviously were impacting ahead of the revenue that these products and services will generate in the future. So there is nothing that is one-off in nature in our guidance.\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we\u2019ll go to Bill Shope.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs: I have a question on the revenue guidance as well. The ramp of China Mobile would presumably act as a tailwind to the March quarter, yet that\u2019s not apparent in the numbers. Can you comment on how you\u2019re thinking about demand trends for China Mobile and perhaps how it compares to prior large carrier ramps?\nPeter Oppenheimer : Let me start, then Tim may want to have some comments. We\u2019re thrilled to be working with China Mobile, and Docomo also. We had a great launch with both carriers, Docomo in the December quarter and China Mobile just in the last couple of weeks. These carrier additions will have a positive impact on our iPhone sales year over year. China Mobile\u2019s 4G service is only available in 16 cities today, and they plan to complete the rollout of more than 500,000 4G base stations, which will cover more than 340 cities by year-end. With the addition of Docomo last quarter, we were able to achieve 69% smartphone market share in Japan, which we\u2019re thrilled with. However, the benefit of these two carrier additions this quarter is being partially offset by a couple of things: first of all, the comparison last year from our late launch of the iPhone 5 and the new iPad in Mainland China, achieving supply and demand balance for the Mini and the iMac in the March quarter, and the impact of currency, particularly the yen. And we\u2019re also deferring more revenue on the iOS devices and Mac. And so to summarize, we\u2019re very, very pleased with what we\u2019re seeing from both carriers. We expect to continue to do well, but we\u2019ve got some things that are offsetting it, that we factored into the guidance.\nTim Cook : I would add, as a further update, we\u2019ve been selling with China Mobile now for about a week, and last week was the best week for activations we\u2019ve ever had in China. So it\u2019s been an incredible start, and at this moment, we\u2019re just selling in 16 cities with China Mobile, and as Peter alluded to, this number is projected to be over 300 cities by the end of this year. And so we\u2019ve got quite the ramp in front of us, and we\u2019re incredibly excited. This comes after a new high water mark in China for us last quarter. We grew revenues including our retail stores at 31%, and we had some very, very strong sales on iPad. iPads in greater China were up 64% year over year, Macs were up 28%. This compares to a tablet market in China that\u2019s growing at 21% per IDC, and a PC market that is contracting by 7%. And so in addition to the great iPhone news with China Mobile and how we\u2019re looking there, we really turned in a stellar quarter in greater China overall, and we are very proud of it.\nBill Shope - Goldman Sachs : Can you comment on your progress so far in getting down the cost curve for the iPhone/iPad? And would you say you\u2019re in line with the types of improvements you\u2019ve seen in cycles prior to the iPhone 5?\nTim Cook : You can see that we projected in the guidance, gross margins between 37% and 38%, and that\u2019s despite going from a holiday quarter to a non-holiday quarter, which we lose quite a bit of leverage from doing that. And so one of the primary things that\u2019s going on there is cost. So yeah, we\u2019re happy with how we\u2019re doing.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross - Cross Research: Can you talk a bit more about opportunities in the mobile payment market? And maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing with regard to use of the touch sensor for mobile payments in your iTunes store, and then how you sort of think about this as an opportunity, whether over time it\u2019s revenue or margin?\nTim Cook : Let me sort of avoid the last part of your question, but in general, we\u2019re seeing that people love being able to buy content, whether it\u2019s music or movies or books, from their iPhone, using Touch ID. It\u2019s incredibly simple and easy and elegant, and it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity there. The mobile payments area in general is one that we\u2019ve been intrigued with, and that was one of the thoughts behind Touch ID. But we\u2019re not limiting ourselves just to that. So I don\u2019t have anything specific to announce today, but you can tell by looking at the demographics of our customers and the amount of commerce that goes through iOS devices versus the competition that it\u2019s a big opportunity on the platform.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein: I have one for Tim, and then a follow up, please. Tim, I wanted to just step back and talk a little bit about iPhone market share. The market data isn\u2019t out for Q1, but if we look at your prior four quarters, fiscal \u201913, Apple grew its iPhone units about 20%. The market grew in the 40s. I think this quarter, even with a new product and having China front loaded, the iPhone is going to grow at a fraction of ultimately what the market is likely to grow at. And I know your belief and philosophy historically has been that you want to make the best product, and that\u2019s the most important thing, but in Macs, you\u2019ve actually succeeded in making the best product and being able to gain share. You cited again how you\u2019ve gained share in 30 out of the last 31 quarters in Mac. But in iPhone, that is not happening. And so my question is, what is different about the smartphone market that is not allowing you to hold or gain unit share despite apparently having the best product, and do you propose to do anything differently going forward, because I think it\u2019s great to have an aspiration to make the best products, but I think that\u2019s in the spirit of ultimately growing at least in line with or faster than the market. And that doesn\u2019t appear to be happening.\nTim Cook : As I\u2019ve said before, our objective has always been to make the best, not the most. And we feel we\u2019re doing that. If you look at what we did this year, we announced two iPhones for the first time, rather than one. And looking at last quarter, if you looked at our sell through - so not sell in, but the sell through - of what I\u2019ll just call our entry phone, or mid phone, and our top phone, with the 5S, all of those grew year over year versus the phones that were in those categories previously. If you look at the emerging markets, which is one of the things that I\u2019ve alluded to that we have to grow in these areas and grow at reasonable amounts, in Latin America we grew at 76% year over year. In the Middle East and Africa, we grew at 65%. In central and eastern Europe, we grew 115%. In China, we grew at 20%. However, as you know, we just added China Mobile, the largest carrier there, in this quarter, and did not have channel load in China Mobile last quarter. We just started selling those in January. Also, in Japan, as we\u2019ve added Docomo, iPhone units were up 40%. Now, when you translate that performance into revenue in Japan, and we have the issue with the yen that Peter spoke about earlier, and so the revenue growth looks much less than that, because of the strength of the dollar there. In North America, we did not do as well, and this weighed our results. Our North American business contracted somewhat year over year. And if you look at the reason for this, one was that as we entered the quarter, and forecasted our iPhone sales, where we achieved what we thought, we actually sold more iPhone 5Ss than we projected. And so the mix was stronger to the 5S, and it took us some amount of time in order to build the mix that customers were demanding. And as a result, we lost some sort of units for part of the quarter in North America and relative to the world, it took us the bulk of the quarter, almost all the quarter, to get the iPhone 5S into proper supply. The other thing that happened in North America specifically was that some carriers changed their upgrade policies. And this affected last quarter, and will have some effect on the current quarter. This restricted customers who are used to upgrading earlier than the 24 months that they\u2019re allowed and sort of stretched the time out to be a hard and fast 24 months. And so that\u2019s a major factor playing into the North American results. So as I back up and sort of zoom out on this, and look at it, one of the most important things for us in the iPhone business was to do really well in emerging markets, and we had the best quarter ever from that respect. Another was to grow in China, because I think you can\u2019t be in the business that we\u2019re in and not have a reasonable China business. And you can see how we did last quarter, and we\u2019ve now followed that up with a deal with China Mobile. And so I feel great about that. I think part of what\u2019s happening in North America is a short term effect because of these upgrade policy changes. This affects the period of time, three to six months, I would think, and then it washes through. So as I look at it, I feel very good about where we are, and I would guess that the market numbers, some of the stuff that you\u2019ve been seeing, will actually be decreased as the revisions come out, given what you\u2019re hearing and what everyone is saying.\nToni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein : I\u2019d like to follow that up, just on your comments on China. You\u2019ve characterized the agreement with China Mobile as huge. Could you tell me what would define success for you in China Mobile one and three years out? What ultimately should we be looking at to measure and ultimately determine whether this was huge?\nTim Cook : I\u2019m not going to give you a forecast for it. I think if you just back up and look at it from a common sense point of view, China Mobile has more subscribers than anyone in the world. They have three quarters of a billion, and so I do see it as a watershed moment for Apple, and have a very strong belief in the ability of those two companies to do great things together.\nOperator: Ben Reitzes with Barclays.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays: My question is for Tim. You\u2019re at the midpoint of your guidance. It obviously implies a decline in revenue in the quarter coming up, and you haven\u2019t done that forever. You came pretty close a couple of quarters ago, but you had some growth. And my question is, are you still a growth company? And should we expect the growth rate to accelerate as we go throughout the year? And why, if that\u2019s the case?\nTim Cook : I think it\u2019s important to listen to what Peter said about the guidance, and about the compares year over year, and the point that he made that the underlying sell through, that we\u2019re very confident of growth year over year. And that is the way we look at it. Some people just look at the numbers on a piece of paper, but the way I\u2019d look at the business is our business from a sell through point of view less iPod, because I think all of us have known for some time that iPod is a declining business. And when you do that, the numbers from last quarter, and the deferral, which we\u2019ve just increased, as Peter went through, when you look at that, and look at the numbers from last quarter, it comes up to a double digit growth. And we\u2019re proud of that. I think that\u2019s a pretty good result. We\u2019ll see how we do in the March quarter, but I do think it\u2019s important in the March quarter to take into consideration sell through versus just a view of sell in.\nBen Reitzes - Barclays : And I guess there\u2019s been a lot of things in the media about your potential to buy back more stock, and shares are around $500 tonight. I was wondering if you thought this was a good level, and whether it was time to accelerate the buyback from current levels. You obviously generated a ton of cash in the quarter, and what are your latest thoughts there?\nTim Cook : We\u2019ve been buying back stock. As you know, last year we increased the program overall, our cash return, doubling it to $100 billion. And $60 billion of that is buyback, and we\u2019ve been progressing on that. Luca can give you the precise numbers of it. So we\u2019re a big believer in buying back the stock, and that doesn\u2019t change today, whether the stock goes up or down.\nOperator: From UBS, we\u2019ll go to Steve Milunovich.\nSteve Milunovich - UBS:\n : Could you talk a bit more about the gross margin? It did provide an upside surprise to your guidance in the quarter. What were the factors? And then looking forward, what are some of the gives and takes for the March quarter?\nLuca Maestri : Let me answer that one. Let me start with the quarter. We were above the guidance range. It was primarily for two factors. We had favorable product mix, and we had favorable commodity pricing. And so those were the two things that actually helped us come in above the guidance range. For the quarter, for Q2, we\u2019re guiding 37% to 38%, compared to 37.9% in the December quarter. We\u2019re going to have some loss of leverage, as you can imagine, because of the usual seasonal decline in revenue. But we expect that loss of leverage to be largely offset by cost improvements and also by less deferred revenue that we\u2019re going to have in Q2.\nSteve Milunovich - UBS : And then regarding overall demand, one thing you didn\u2019t mention, Tim, is maturity of the particularly high end smartphone market. I know in our surveys we\u2019re finding, relative to a year ago, a lot higher percentage or Apple buyers already have an Apple handset. So I\u2019m curious if you think the Western world can show decent unit growth over the next year or two. And I was also wondering, the 5C generally is viewed as having turned out to be pretty light in the mix. What are you going to do with that product going forward?\nTim Cook : Well, I\u2019ll sidestep the last question, of course, because it\u2019s about future products. But to your question about the 5S in particular, if I look at the sell through year over year, there was growth in that portion of the line, despite adding an entirely new phone underneath it. And so I think that\u2019s a good sign, and that\u2019s despite it being in short supply for the bulk or virtually all of the quarter. And so I do believe that that category of product can grow in those markets, if you\u2019re thinking about the U.S. and western Europe, for example, and Japan. In Japan, we grew 40% last quarter. That\u2019s fairly good.\nOperator: Brian Marshall with ISI Group.\nBrian Marshall - ISI Group: Obviously the iPhone business grew about 7% year over year, $200 million in [unintelligible] unit sales now. And that\u2019s with two new [unintelligible] being launched in the quarter. Can you help us think about how you guys view the iPhone new user growth out there in the marketplace versus simply a solid replacement cycle that the company has in its installed base?\nTim Cook : We saw a significant new to iPhone number. It\u2019s not a number that we throw out, but we particularly saw that on the 5C, which is what we wanted to see. So it\u2019s clearly not just upgraders. As a matter of fact, the upgraders, particularly in North America, would have been less than we thought, because of the changes in the upgrade policy that I talked about earlier.\nBrian Marshall - ISI Group : And then with respect to innovation at the company, obviously iPhone came out in 2007, iPad came out in 2010. 2013 came around, we\u2019ve got some new products, obviously, but nothing really from our new product category. Do you care to comment on the innovation cycle of the company and the cadence there?\nTim Cook : It\u2019s never been stronger. I\u2019m very confident with the work that\u2019s going on, and I think our customers are going to love what we\u2019re going to do.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets: I had a question and a follow up. And Tim, for you, the first one, to follow up from Brian\u2019s question, you\u2019re growing iPhones about 7%. I think the market is going to end up looking up to be 14%. Are you happy with the pricing umbrella that you currently have? When you originally brought out iPhones, in subsequent periods you talked about wanting to push some pricing umbrellas. But are you happy with the pricing umbrellas that you have? In particular, as you think about the 5C, I think most of the industry views have panned the product as not being enough features for that price point. But if you could just talk about the positioning of your broader product portfolio on iPhones. Are you happy where you are?\nTim Cook : I think last quarter we did a tremendous job, particularly given the mix was something very different than we thought. It was the first time we\u2019d ever run that particular play before, and demand percentage turned out to be different than we thought. We obviously always look at our results, and conclude what to change moving forward. And if we decide it\u2019s in our best interest to make a change, then we\u2019ll make one. Obviously I\u2019m not going to predict price changes on the earnings call.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Sorry, not price changes, but at least product position. Are you willing to expand the product portfolio into new categories within the phone family?\nTim Cook : We\u2019re willing to make any product that\u2019s a great product. Where our line in the sand is, it\u2019s making something that\u2019s not fantastic.\nKeith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Then my follow up for you Peter is, you mentioned four factors that influenced guidance. In particular, you talked about inventory. I think most investors would conclude then December wasn\u2019t as good as it looked, if you had increases in channel inventory. So I was hoping you could peel off a little bit and talk about the foreign exchange impact and the higher deferrals. Is there a way to quantify that impact on the guidance in March in particular?\nPeter Oppenheimer :\n :\nOperator: From Pacific Crest Securities, we\u2019ll go to Andy Hargreaves.\nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities : Just a quick follow up to some of your comments about demand mix being significantly different, or different than what you thought, in the quarter. Do you have any thoughts on why it was so much different than what you expected it to be?\nTim Cook : I think the 5S, people are really intrigued with Touch ID. It\u2019s a major feature that has excited people. And I think that, associated with the other things that are unique to the 5S, got the 5S to have a significant amount more attention and a higher mix of sales.\nAndy Hargreaves - Pacific Crest Securities :\n :\nTim Cook: What Luca is saying is that we\u2019re working on things that are things that you see that we\u2019re shipping today but that we\u2019re working on things that you can\u2019t see today.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.\nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: What\u2019s your user data kind of telling you right now in terms of the replacement cycle? Are you starting to see a lot of heritage Apple users now refresh their iPhone every three years plus, or their iPad every two years plus, versus previous? Are you seeing any major changes there?\nTim Cook : We don\u2019t have great data yet from last quarter. And so I don\u2019t know the answer to your question.\nMark Moskowitz - JPMorgan : And then the follow up is around this opex being flat relative to the revenue guidance. Is there something around the vertical in terms of maybe increasing focus on the enterprise vertical that you see an opportunity to take advantage of, maybe hiring more folks to service that industry?\nTim Cook: It\u2019s clear that the enterprise area has huge potential, and we\u2019re doing well from a percentage of companies that are using iPhone and iPad. It\u2019s up to unbelievable numbers. The iPhone is used in 97% of the Fortune 500, and 91% of the Global 500, and iPad is used in 98% of the Fortune 500 and 93% of the Global 500. And we have a number of accounts, some of which Peter reviewed in the opening remarks, that have tens of thousands of iOS devices working. And also, as I think was mentioned earlier, 90% of tablet activations in corporations are iPads. And 95% of total app activations were on iOS. And I think that\u2019s an incredible measure of ultimately how sticky the products are, because you can get so much productivity out of an iPad and an iPhone. And so I think the road in enterprise is a longer one. The arc is longer than in consumer, which can immediately go out and buy things, etc. And I think we\u2019ve done a lot of the groundwork as you can tell from these numbers that I\u2019ve given you, and I would expect that it would have more and more payback in the future.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray: Just a follow up to some of the previous questions. Tim, I\u2019ve got to ask it. In the previous quarters, you\u2019ve talked about specifically product categories multiple, and that\u2019s different than variations of existing products. And that would be by the end of 2014. I just want to be clear that\u2019s still on track, and consistent with some of the expenses that we talked about earlier in the call?\nTim Cook : Yes, absolutely. No change.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray : And then second, and this goes back to some of the other themes on the call here too, but you\u2019re obviously going to have a big year in terms of new product categories. And maybe even thinking beyond 2014, when the new products come out and they kind of ramp in 2015, how do you think about the trajectory of the platform, or what would you say to investors to say this is just a product cycle story?\nTim Cook: I would just say, innovation is deeply embedded in everybody here, and there\u2019s still so much of the world that is full of very complex products, etc. We have zero issue coming up with things we want to do that we think we can disrupt in a major way. The challenge is always to focus to the very few that deserve all of our energy. And we\u2019ve always done that, and we\u2019re continuing to do that.\nNancy Paxton: A replay of today\u2019s call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on Apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we are reporting a very strong finish to a record breaking year and I\u2019d like to reflect on some of the highlights. We completed our fiscal year in September, and we are proud to report revenue of $234 billion, an increase of 28% and $51 billion over 2014. This is our largest absolute revenue growth ever. To put that into some context, our growth in one year was greater than the full year revenue of almost 90% of the companies in the Fortune 500. We made huge inroads into emerging markets generating over $79 billion in revenue and growing 63% despite very strong headwinds from foreign exchange rates. These results are made possible by Apple\u2019s commitment to innovation and creating the best products on earth. In the past 12 months around the world we\u2019ve sold over 300 million devices including 231 million iPhones, 55 million iPads and 21 million Macs setting new unit records and increasing our global market share for both iPhone and Mac. We crossed 100 billion cumulative downloads from the App Store and we added powerful new services to our ecosystem, including Apple Pay in the United States, in the United Kingdom, Apple Music in over a 100 countries, and Apple News in the U.S. We also entered an entirely new category with Apple Watch and we are in the very early innings of this promising new part of our business. We generated over $53 billion dollars in net income and grew earnings per share by 43%. We returned almost $50 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while continuing to invest confidently in research and development, marketing and distribution, our retail and online stores, our supply chain and our infrastructure. We also completed 15 acquisitions to enhance and accelerate our roadmap for products and services. We accomplished all of these things while intensifying our efforts to protect the environment to promote equality and human rights and to ensure the security and privacy we know our customers deserve. We are ending the year on a high note with a record breaking September quarter including sales of 48 million iPhones beating our expectations and up 22% year-over-year. Momentum for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus remained very strong across the quarter and we established a new launch record for iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus near the end of the quarter. We are seeing strong interest around the world and we\u2019ve been getting great feedback from customers who love the iPhone\u2019s new features including 3D touch, live photos, the new iSight camera, and the powerful new A-9 processor in the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. We exited the quarter with demand for our new iPhones exceeding supply but we\u2019ve made good progress with our manufacturing ramp in the initial weeks of October. We sold an all time record 5.7 million Macs continuing to defy the negative trend in the global personal computer market which IDC estimates contracted by 11%. The App Store set new all-time quarterly records for both the number of transacting customers and overall revenue. The strong performance of the App Store helped fuel $5.1 billion in services revenue also an all-time record. Sales of Apple Watch were also up sequentially and were ahead of our expectations. This quarter we introduced beautiful new Apple Watch cases and bands including new Gold and Rose Gold aluminum Apple Watch Sport models. We released Watch OS 2 in September paving the way for a whole new class of native apps that are faster and can take advantage of the hardware capabilities of Apple Watch such as the microphone, speaker and the heart rate sensor. Today, there are over 13,000 apps in the Watch App Store including over 1300 native apps such as Facebook messenger, MLB At Bat and Runkeeper and the number is growing rapidly. Apple Watch has already had a tremendous effect on customers\u2019 health and fitness and the stories we\u2019re hearing about its impact are truly inspirational. I personally heard from people who credit Apple Watch with saving their lives and customers are finding new applications all the time in their day to day activities. Revenue in Greater China nearly doubled year-over-year and we continue to focus and invest heavily there. I just returned from a four day visit to Hangzhou and Beijing where we announced major new initiatives to provide renewable energy for our supply chain. I also visited our retail stores in China which are among the busiest in the world. On Saturday we opened a new store, our 25th in Greater China to a very enthusiastic crowd and we are on track to achieve our goal of 40 stores by the middle of next year. Yesterday, we started taking orders for the all new Apple TV and it was a huge first day for this exciting new product. We want to provide the same innovation in the living room that we delivered in our iOS devices. People are already watching more TV through apps today and we think apps represent the future of TV. We\u2019ve built a new foundation around this vision with a new operating system called tvOS innovative ways to connect with your screen and a smart use of Siri to search for what to watch. Next month, we\u2019ll begin shipping iPad Pro, the most powerful iPad we\u2019ve ever made. iPad Pro will enable a new generation of apps for entertainment and productivity, design and illustration, engineering and medical and much more, and with the Apple Pencil and Smart keyboards users can customize their experience making iPad Pro an even more powerful tool for everyone from students to artists, to business professionals. iOS 9 has hit the ground running on track to be downloaded by more users than any software release in Apple\u2019s history with 61% of active iOS devices already running at less than six weeks after its September the 16th release. In late September, we also launched OS X El Capitan which has made the world most advanced desktop operating system more refined and powerful than ever before. Apple Music has set a completely new standard, redefining and combining the best ways to enjoy music in a single immersive app. Over 15 million individual and family accounts are experiencing Apple music including over 6.5 million paying customers. We are thrilled to bring Apple Music to China beginning this quarter along with iTunes, movies and iBooks and we are especially happy to offer such great new and diverse content to our large highly engaged and rapidly growing customer base in China. We are also looking forward to bringing Apple Music to the new Apple TV beginning this week. Apple Pay is seeing double digit growth in transaction month after month and we continue to add major businesses including Starbucks which will roll out Apple Pay support to all its U.S. stores in 2016. Apple Pay now supports merchant rewards programs as well and popular retailers that will be coming online in the next few weeks. We are thrilled to announce today that we are partnering with American Express to bring Apple Pay to eligible customers in key global markets so even more people can experience the easy, secure and private way to pay. Apple Pay will be available to eligible American Express customers in Australia, in Canada this year and is expected to expand to Spain, Singapore and Hong Kong in 2016. The reach of our ecosystem continues to grow and iOS is changing more and more aspects of our customer\u2019s lives in very meaningful ways from their health, to their homes, to their cars. In Health, there are now more than 1,600 health kit enabled solutions that are helping us live a healthier day. In the home there are over 50 brands working on home kit enabled accessories that can be privately and securely controlled from your iPad and iPhone, and in the car more than 50 automobile models have been announced with CarPlay support which provides a smarter, safer and more fun way to use iPhone in the car. And we will continue to work to make the iOS experience even more meaningful across more touch points of our daily lives. The impact of research kit also continues to build. We recently announced new studies on autism, epilepsy and melanoma adding to the important studies already underway on conditions from asthma to diabetes to Parkinson\u2019s disease. Our iOS news app is off to a great start. Nearly 40 million people are reading Apple news and we\u2019ve been getting very positive feedback from the publishers. We have now signed more than 70 publishers representing hundreds of titles and we\u2019re happy to announce that news just launched in the United Kingdom and Australia with partners such as the BBC, NewsCorp, The Telegraph, The Guardian, Financial Times, Daily Mail and the Australian Broadcasting Service. And finally, we are making great strides in the enterprise market, announcing a new strategic partnership with Cisco in September while furthering our progress with IBM in building our mobility partners program. We estimate that enterprise markets accounted for about $25 billion in annual Apple revenue in the last 12 months, up 40% over the prior year and they represent a major growth vector for the future. I\u2019d like to thank our talented and incredibly hardworking employees, our developers and our business partners around the world and of course our very loyal customers for making 2015 Apples\u2019 most successful year yet. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Luca to go over the September quarter results in more detail.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. It\u2019s great to conclude our record fiscal 2015 with our strongest September quarter ever. Revenue for the quarter was $51.5 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion or 22% year over year. Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the expanded availability of Apple Watch and all time high services revenue and Mac sales. We achieved these outstanding results despite severe and persisting weakness in foreign exchange rates around the world that affected all our geographic segments and this makes our year-over-year growth rates even more remarkable. In constant currency, our growth during the fourth quarter would have been 800 basis points higher. We once again reported very strong numbers in Greater China with revenue growing 99% year-over-year to $12.5 billion. Emerging markets performance was strong overall up 65% year-over-year and representing 31% of total company revenue for the quarter. Company gross margin was 39.9%, up sequentially better than our expectations, mainly due to lower than expected costs. Operating margin was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $11.1 billion, a new September quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.96, a 38% year-over-year increase and cash flow from operations was $13.5 billion, also a new fourth quarter record. For details by product I'll start with iPhone. We sold 48 million iPhones in the quarter, up 22% year over year with strong performance around the world throughout the quarter. Total iPhone sales were up 120% in Mainland China and grew over 35% in South Asia and increased by over 20% in several markets around the world including Germany and Italy. iPhone ASP was $670, an increase of $67 year-over-year, thanks to more favorable mix and in spite of the very significant negative impact from foreign exchange that I referred to earlier. We increased iPhone channel inventory by less than 2 million units in order to support our new product launch at the very end of September quarter. We exited the quarter with demand exceeding supply and channel inventory below our target range of 5 to 7 weeks. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.7 million Macs, which is an all time quarterly record and represents 3% year-over-year growth. We extended our very long running trend of PC market share gains based on IDC's latest estimate of a 11% global market contraction. Mac growth was driven primarily by the great customer response to our new MacBook and sales of MacBook Pro also remained strong. We ended the quarter below our 4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad. We sold 9.9 million compared to 12.3 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sell-through was 10.4 million as we reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units. We exited the quarter below our 5 to 7 week target range of iPad channel inventory. iPad customer metrics remain extremely positive. In August, ChangeWave measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, 70% planned to purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction rate for iPad and a 90 day purchase intent of 73%. In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be very successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 73% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad has 74% share of the U.S. Commercial Tablet market. As Tim mentioned our enterprise initiatives continue to expand. In September we announced a new strategic partnership with Cisco to optimize their networks for iOS devices with a goal of providing iOS mobile users with great performance advantage over other mobile platforms. Also, during the September quarter, IBM released new mobile first for iOS apps in healthcare, financial services, travel and transportation and industrial sectors, including new apps leveraging iOS 9 and Watch OS 2. There are now 55 apps in the IBM mobile first for iOS catalogue and the list of projects signings is growing rapidly. Inside IBM, Macs are gaining tremendous traction. There are currently over 30,000 Macs deployed within the company with 1,900 more being added each week. IBM tells us that each Mac is saving $270 compared to a traditional PC, thanks to the much reduced support cost and better residual value. This is a terrific example of the kind of opportunity our devices offer to improve user experience and create value in the enterprise world. Our mobility partner program also continues to grow with more than 25 new partners added in the September quarter bringing the total to over 65 and we are already seeing some great success stories with this program. We are also very excited about the potential of iPad Pro and the enterprise. For example, with the Bloomberg professional app, more than 325,000 financial professionals will be able to use iPad Pro to gain instant global access to finance and business news, market data and portfolio tracking and trading tools. Turning to services. We generated $5.1 billion in revenue, a new all-time record, and an increase of 10% over last year mainly due to strong growth from apps. The revenue from the App Store increased 25% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record. Services growth was particularly impressive in China, where Apple App Store revenue grew by 127% year-over-year. The momentum behind the App Store in China has been tremendous with huge interest from developers and customers alike. Our developer program in China has grown dramatically in the last year with over 1 million members in our program today. Revenue from other products grew strongly up 61% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter and it was available at almost 5000 locations in 32 countries at quarter end. Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter. We opened 7 new stores, including our first store in Belgium. That brought us to a global store count of 463 of which 195 are in 15 countries outside the United States. In fiscal 2016, we expect to open or replace between 40 and 50 stores and we continue to place particular emphasis on Greater China where we plan to have 40 stores opened by the middle of next year. Customers have been very interested in the iPhone upgrade program offered in our U.S. retail stores. The iPhone upgrade program gives customer purchasing a connected device an easy convenient way to get a new phone every year with low monthly payments to a third party lender along with the security and protection of AppleCare Plus. After making 12 or more installment payments, customers can upgrade to a new iPhone. Let me also quickly discuss three accounting matters. First, relative to the iPhone upgrade program that I just mentioned, we will be reducing revenue at the time of sale for the cost associated with the program and deferring the portion of revenue related to AppleCare software upgrade rights and non software services for each iPhone sold. Second, in September based on an analysis of market offerings we reduced the estimated selling price of future software upgrade rights and non software services that we defer for each iOS device and Mac sold, the reduction is between $5 and $10 per unit. Third, also in September we lengthened the time period over which the deferred revenue associated to iPads will be recognized from two years to three years. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $205.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $2.8 billion. $187 billion of this cash, or 91% of the total, was outside of the United States. In the September quarter, we issued a total of $5.8 billion of term debt, consisting of 1.25 billion British pound denominated notes, 2.25 billion Australian dollar denominated notes and 2 billion euro denominated notes. This left us with $56 billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter.  We were very active in the market during the quarter and returned over $17 billion to our investors. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $14 billion to repurchase almost 122 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also completed our fifth accelerated share repurchase program in July and retired an additional 10 million shares at settlement. We have now completed over $143 billion of our $200 billion program including $104 billion in share repurchases of which $36 billion was repurchased in fiscal 2015 alone. Now, as we move ahead into December quarter, I like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $75.5 and $77.5 billion compared to $74.6 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 39% and 40%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.3 billion and $6.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.2%. Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on November 12, 2015 to shareholders of record as of November 09, 2015. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operation Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Yes, thanks, good afternoon. In light of December quarter revenue guidance, firmly low single digit revenue growth and what looks like increasingly tough comps heading into the March quarter, how do you get comfortable that Apple isn\u2019t on the verge of [ex] [ph] growth for the first time in a decade? And then I have a follow up.\nTim Cook: Katy, it\u2019s Tim. You have to consider the constant currency growth rates. And so if you do that, our guidance is actually 8% to 11% because we have about a 700 basis point FX headwind in Q1. And so the growth is actually quite good underneath that and that\u2019s obviously a problem with everyone struggling with it. Zooming out to the more macro question about growth, here\u2019s what I see currently. We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base that on what we are seeing from a switcher point of view, we recorded the highest rate on record for Android switches last quarter at 30%. We also look at the number of people that have upgraded, that were in the installed base prior to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. And that number is in the low 30 percentages. So we feel like we have a very open field in front of us. Our performance in emerging markets although it\u2019s quite good and our revenue was good our market share is low and the LTE penetration in these markets is quite low. Also, if I zoom out and look at China, as I have said before and just to make the point once again is we see an enormous change in China over the next several years. The latest study I have seen from Mackenzie indicates if you look back five years China\u2019s middle class had about 50 million people in it. If you look ahead five years, it will have ten times that number in it. And so -- and I feel like we are reasonably well positioned in China, I\u2019m sure we can do better, but I think we are doing fairly well there. It\u2019s not the only market that we are working on obviously. I was really impressed last quarter with our progress in Vietnam and Indonesia and India among others. Also, from the currency point of view and the weak global economies, we don\u2019t overly focus on this. It\u2019s - my view is that it\u2019s sort of a transitional kind of thing and we invest for the long term, so we are continuing to invest for Apple\u2019s future. In addition to those Apple TV is off to a great start. Apple Watch is just getting going. The app store hit a new record again last quarter and the growth seems to be really great there. I\u2019m really happy with the early days of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music business. And finally, the enterprise business is not to be underestimated, I doubt very many people knew that we had $25 billion enterprise business that we quietly built in not too many years, but our penetration is low, but we have significant actions going on to really deepen that. So sort of everywhere I look I see significant opportunity. Long answer but I thought you might be interested.\nKaty Huberty: No. I appreciate that. Just as a follow-up on growth, if you look at large services companies, Facebook, Amazon, Google, they're all growing over 20% and it's largely driven by activity of Apple users on iOS devices. Do you feel like there is more that Apple can do to participate in that services growth or you relegated to fundamentals that are tied to device upgrade cycles?\nTim Cook: Well, the App Store is growing over 20%, it grew 25% last quarter, and so we feel very good about that. That's become a sizeable business. I would also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market, they sort of began to look more like a subscription business in terms of the way they operate. And so we think that in the aggregate that they may reduce upgrade cycles and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that we're not hitting today largely which could help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you very much.\nTim Cook: Yep.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. May we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.\nGene Munster: Good afternoon and congratulations. Tim, you just briefly touched on as reducing the time between upgrades, but how do you think about the iPhone upgrade cycle compressing over the next few years, obviously the impact from carrier\u2019s changes in the iPhone upgrade program. Can you talk a little bit about when that's going to be rolled out internationally? And then lastly, Luca you mentioned some of the accounting changes related to the iPhone upgrade program. Any sense in terms of what percentage of the Plus \u2013 the s upgrades were associated with the upgrade program? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Gene, in terms of the upgrade program it's early, but here's what we believe our current view is that we do think that the broader upgrade program, so I'm not just talking about our program that in retail, I mean, that is relatively small compared to our total iPhone sales of the company, but the broader thing obviously is that many of the carriers are offering these plans. And that, if you look at them in the aggregate, we think that it would have a positive impact in replacement cycles. We do like the fact that it creates a market for an iPhone at a different price point as well that is a better product than that customer maybe currently buying which would further help from an ecosystem point of view and that's not to be underestimated. It also seems like that from a rollout point of view there's a -- you will see these plans offered in a significant way in the United States already, but in fact these plans are being offered in some derivation in over dozen countries in the world. They're not as pervasive as they are in the U.S. but it seems like we\u2019re on the front end of fairly major trends in the industry.\nLuca Maestri: From a financial perspective, Gene, the transaction on our iPhone upgrade program is a purchase, it\u2019s not a lease and so we recognize our revenue upfront, of course we deduct also upfront the cost associated with the program essentially to provide interest free financing and we need to estimate deferred value of the upgrade option for the customer, but as Tim said, it\u2019s a popular program in our U.S store, in the scheme of things, it\u2019s a small percentage of our worldwide iPhone sales and so we'll have really a negligible impact for example, on ASPs for the phone.\nGene Munster: And Tim, if we put it all together is it something that has more measurable impact on the business two, three quarters down the road, is that the right way to generally think about it?\nTim Cook: Yes, we think about it as being \u2013 there were some clearly that were offered in the market prior to this cycle. But they became much more pervasive and much communicated, I think much wider with the September announcements. And so, I would sort of expect to begin seeing this somewhere around a year from now.\nGene Munster: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Gene. May we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Moving on, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. Tim, I appreciated the color that you provided on the drivers of iPhone growth in Q1. I think the investor concern is that Q1 will benefit at least on a year over year basis from three extra weeks of availability in China. And it will also benefit from more of those initial launch days that only two of them were in the September quarter and the remainder will be in the December quarter. And so I guess the investor concern is December is a structurally advantaged quarter in the sense of benefiting from both of those tailwinds on a year-over-year basis. But if we look out beyond December, wouldn't that point to notably lower seasonal growth than the March quarter. And how do we think about the factors affecting unit growth beyond the December quarter? And then I have a follow-up, please.\nTim Cook: We don't guide beyond December, as you know Toni. I do think that the sort of the macro things that I spoke about earlier, the upgrade programs, the Android Switcher rate, the iPhone momentum in the emerging markets and the LTE penetration in these markets these trends are not one quarter things. These are longer term things. The same \u2013 my same response applies and I think we'll do quite good in iPhone. I do believe we'll grow this quarter as we put in our guidance that when you start with a number in the low 30s in terms of the percentage of the installed base that\u2019s upgraded that had a phone pre the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, that number still likely to leave a lot of headroom beyond December. So that's how I look at that. In terms of your first comment, you didn't asked me to comment on that, but just to be clear, our forecasting doesn't work like you articulated it. I recognize that people can have their own models and so forth, but just to make it clear that I'm not agreeing with your point.\nToni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then just on the follow-up, the reported gains from currency hedging in fiscal year 2015 were significant, several billion dollar contribution to the company. And again, this is not an Apple's specific issue, Luca as you pointed out several times, but how do we think about this notion of currency hedges effectively rolling off and being replaced with hedges that are likely have less of an impact. How do we think about that impact the P&L on a go forward basis, perhaps starting with Q1, but then qualitatively or directionally over the course of the year? And what is some of kinds of things that you've undertaken or planning to undertake that could mitigate some of those concerns?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. I think, Toni, it\u2019s a very good point, I mean, what's going to happen in practice is that we got this portfolio of hedge comp such that over time provides protection to our margins and to our results, but that protection diminishes as we go through the year and so we should expect that in over time during the course of fiscal 2016 that protection will come off assuming that the dollar stays at current levels. Keep in mind, there are some currencies around the world that where we cannot economically hedge and so those currencies are bit excluded from what we're talking about right now. I think my conclusion is that the guidance that we're providing for the first quarter that 39% to 40% it actually an incredible level of guidance given the foreign exchange headwinds that we're dealing with. How do we deal with that? We continue to hedge, so our program continues on an ongoing basis and we will continue to provide some level of protection to foreign exchange movement. In some cases we have realign prices particularly when we launch new products. We tend to do that in a number of countries where the foreign exchange moves have been particularly extreme, and so we tend to recover that through pricing. And then finally, of course we are putting in place a number of cost initiatives that would allow us to deal with the foreign exchange situation. So, overall we feel very strong guidance for the first quarter. And beyond the first quarter as you know we're not guiding and so we'll see over the course of the year.\nToni Sacconaghi: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Tim, I wanted to go back to your commentary on the enterprise business, $25 billion I think you said, it was up 40% year-over-year. I know you have a relatively small sales force internally and obviously you utilizing the joint ventures, but as you noted you see that's an important driver of growth. So, how do you attack that market going forward? Will there be changes? Is there something that you need to shift or focus product in a little bit of different directions to make sure you can adequately attack it. Just in general how you're thinking about it?\nTim Cook: From a product point of view, we'd actually been continuing to change and improve IOS for some time. With every release they are more enterprise features and so, I would describe it as sort of continuation of that cadence perhaps with little more intensity. From a go to market point of view, we will be working with or are working with IBM. With Cisco. We're already working with 75 mobility partners that are principally in the U.S. but that's expanding quickly to international as well. And so, many of these companies have -- in some cases very large sales forces, in many cases the reasonable seize sales force. And in addition to a direct sales force there is a huge worldwide indirect channel that many customers buy from and count on buying some services from. And so I do not envision Apple's having a large enterprise sales force will certainly make \u2013 we continue adding some people more on the engineering side, but I don't envision having a large direct sales force.\nShannon Cross: Okay, great. Thank you. And can you give us some more color on China, 120% year-over-year growth in iPhones, but can you talk in general about what you're seeing in the marketplace and perhaps where you think you in terms of penetration from a smartphone standpoint especially with a China Mobile which has a substantial opportunity to grow given the LTE penetration?\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at China, we grew from an iPhone point of view, Greater China, we grew 87% the market grew for. If you take iPhone out of the market number, the certain market x iPhone actually contracted slightly. And so, we've been able to grow without the market growing. iPhone 6 was the number one selling smartphone in Mainland, China last quarter and iPhone 6 Plus was number three. And so, we did fairly well. The sort of the economic question which I know there's a bit lot of attention on, frankly, if I were to shut off my web and shut off the TV and just look how many customers are coming in our stores regardless to whether they're buying, how many people are coming online, and in addition looking at our sales trend, I wouldn't know if there was any economic issue at all in China. And so I don't know how unusual we are with that. I think that there's a misunderstanding probably particularly in the Western world about China's economy, which contributes to the confusion. That said, I don't think it\u2019s growing as fast as it was, but I also don't think that Apple's results are largely dependent on minor changes than growth. I think it\u2019s much more of contributing \u2013 I think other things contribute to that much more. That does say, you'll never had problem there, because the economy, I'm not saying, I'm dumb enough to think that. But I just think that the area that it's currently operating within, it's hard to tell the difference of the consumer level for us. I mean, you really can't tell the difference, if you look at sort of our daily and weekly numbers. So, we're very bullish on it, and I would point out that we're investing in China not for next or the quarter after, or the quarter after, we're investing for the decades ahead and as we look at it our own views is that China will be Apple's top market in the world. And that's not just for sales, that's also developer community is growing faster than any other country in the world. And so, the ecosystem there is very, very strong. I was very impressed with the number the developers I met last week and of course, the customers in stores are enthusiastically contagious.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS\nSteve Milunovich: Thank you. Tim, I wanted to talk about the two sources of your iPhone demand selling to current customers and selling to new customers. In terms of selling to current customers you indicated about a third of the base is moved to the sixth line. As much as people talk about that been a huge upgrade cycle and what is the six has have incrementally, 33% not that a bigger number, I would have thought it would be bigger than that. Does this suggest that there is maybe more of a consistency to upgrading than the street perceives. And then on the other side in terms of new customers, just wanted clarity on the switcher number, are you saying that 30% of iPhone shipments in the quarter went to android switchers to IOS. And do you believe that you could actually have more new customers to Apple in fiscal 2016 than you had fiscal 2015.\nTim Cook: There's a lot there. Let me start with the Android Switcher. What this means is that for customers to purchase an iPhone last quarter and replace the smartphone that 30% of those switched from an android device. And so there would have been some switchers on top of that from other operating systems, but obviously android is the largest one by far. And so that's what that means, and that number is the largest that we've ever recorded since we began measuring it three or so years ago. And so, it\u2019s a huge number, we're very, very proud of that number. In terms of 2016 versus 2015 new customers, it's hard to predict. I'm very happy with how we're doing. We're doing better than we've ever been doing. People -- I know there's a fixation on the upgrade rate. When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that it\u2019s a low number because that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year. That's a large number. And so, I'd see that is opportunity. Do I think it has anything, does to length to consistency? I think part of it is and I believe that the iPhone upgrade plans that are out there as I've mentioned before it seems to me on the future. We'll tell it\u2019s true or not, but it seems to me it\u2019s going to act as a catalyst to accelerate some of this upgrades. And I think that's not something that we're going to see this quarter or next quarter, but it seems like it\u2019s going to happen beginning a year for now or so. It have begins to be \u2013 you've seen the plan. They look more and active like a subscription than they do like a purchase. And that's great for the customer because many of them want to upgrade on a frequent basis and they can do this very, very simply. In terms of new, I don't know, whether we'll more new or not. I can tell you that that's always our objective. We want to add a lot more people to the ecosystem and certainly if you look in the emerging markets, even like, nobody is asking about iPad on the call. But if you look at iPad as just an example, in China, 68% of the people that purchased an iPad it was the first tablet they've owned and 40% of those have never owned any Apple product. Just to go through one product with one set of number. I don't want to get through a bunch of numbers because it does contain the data than I don't want to share. But these are things that we're very focused on. And the first time buyer number is surprisingly strong. And keep in mind that we have a good history of bunch of people buy one Apple product, they have a great experience. They begin to look at other Apple products. And of course we makes they all work well together.\nSteve Milunovich: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Steve. Could we have next question, please?\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Simona Jankowski.\nSimona Jankowski: Hi. Thank you very much. Just is a follow-up to that last question and to put that in context, roughly what percent of the iPhone shipments come from shipments for the installed based versus from your user shipment?\nTim Cook: I don't know the answer of your question.\nSimona Jankowski: Okay. And then just a follow-up, as Luca mentioned, you had to make some adjustments to the pricing in various regions given the currency move we've had. What had been the response in terms of demand, I guess both in terms of units and revenues in some of these regions like Japan or India, parts of Europe where the local prices has to go up?\nLuca Maestri: Simona, we've made a number of price changes during the course of fiscal 2015. What we've seen in a normal of these markets, we've seen that iPhone sales have been very resilient and that shown in our growth rates. Most recently we've adjusted some prices around the world for the launch of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. We are very positive about the safest trends around the world. It\u2019s a bit early to tell, because the phones have out there just for four weeks, so its bit early to tell there. Obviously when we increase prices around the world, it's normal to see some impact on sales rates, but so far we were encouraged by the response.\nTim Cook: Let me go back to your question. And this is an exactly what you're asking that what your view, I think some color is. The reason I can't answer this is, we don't look at any aggregate, we actually look at the detailed because it's much more important for to us to look at, buy iPhone model by country, what percentage going to our first iPhone buyers. Somebody that's never owned an iPhone before. And so if you look at China as an example, it's over 50% of people that bought 6 and 6 Plus were buying their first iPhone. As you move down the line, that numbers goes up. And so a 5s generally speaking is higher in most countries. And so, that gives a feel for very important market and we cannot where the numbers are.\nSimona Jankowski: Great. Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Simona. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. Two questions from me as well. I guess, first could you talk about the gross margin dynamic as you go from September to December, the midpoint implies on 20 basis points. I think the last five years that's only happen once the gross margin is going down in fiscal Q1. Can you just talk about what the FX dynamic or what area the other headwinds that you think that implies gross margins being done in December?\nTim Cook: Yes. Let me give you puts and takes for margins for the December quarter. On the positive side, of course as you mentioned that we would have positive leverage from the higher seasonal volumes. Also what we've seen over the last several quarters is a commodity environment that has been quite favorable and we expect it to remain favorable during the December quarter. On the other hand, of course we are launching a lot of new products. We\u2019ve launched some during September. We are launching some now and everything we launch new products, we make them better. We had features and new technology and these products when we launch and tend to have higher cost structures than the products what they replaced. We have a very good track record overtime to reduce those cost structures, but every time we introduce a new product that is a headwind at the beginning of the cycle for gross margin. While it\u2019s different from a year ago very significantly with the foreign exchange impact that we have mentioned before it remains a very significant headwind as I mentioned earlier to Tony I believe we are dealing with that to a combination of hedging, price realignments [ph] cost initiatives, but on a net basis foreign exchange we will clearly by a sequential headwind.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then Tim when you talk about seeing iPhone growth in fiscal Q1, I\u2019m curious is that statement more reflective of iPhone units or iPhone revenues so that the ASPs could hardly get growth even if units are not there. And then would you expect to exit within the 5 to 7 week optimal inventory range in fiscal Q1?\nTim Cook: I don\u2019t know that we will exit. We make that call late in the quarter as we see what the demand is because we are actually trying to position the inventory for the following quarter instead of the current quarter. And it\u2019s very difficult to predict. What was your other question?\nAmit Daryanani: I was just curious to your statement on iPhone growth in fiscal Q1, is that a reflection of\u2026.\nTim Cook: Is it revenue? I was making a revenue statement but units are also, yes we expect units to be up as well.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From JPMorgan we\u2019ll go to Rod Hall.\nRod Hall: Yes thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask Tim maybe if you could comment on the mix between iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s. And whether the mix of demand is any different than what you say for instance that the iPhone 5, 5s point whether there is more say iPhone 6, I know you highlighted that the iPhone 6 is a number one phone in China for example and then I have a follow up?\nTim Cook: The statement I made in China was about Q4 and the 6s was only available in China for two days last quarter. The iPhone 6s is the most popular iPhone that we currently sell. In terms of has there been a change. If you look at iPhone 6 today, and add iPhone 6 Plus and compare that to last year\u2019s 5s we are doing better, at that price point than we were previously.\nRod Hall: Okay, thank you. And then there\u2019s follow up for what you were doing on the upgrade program. I am wondering if can you envision a time ever made in the U.S. or elsewhere where you would not have to come into an Apple store to activate it or to take advantage of the upgrade you might be able to do that somewhere else, do you start now what your\u2026.\nTim Cook: That\u2019s a really good question. We actually solved that problem back in 2007. But then quickly had to change it in order to scale in a major way. And so that is something that we would always -- sort of always in our mind that one day from a customer experience point of view we would like to make things as easy as possible for the customer. And to some degree you can already do that with buying online. But there are many different plans and search what the people buy, that they have to come in for several times we would love to have that automated and working with our partners, with service providers.\nRod Hall: Great. Thank you very much.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nA - Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Rod.

Our year-over-year growth rate in the fiscal third quarter accelerated over the first half of fiscal 2015. Revenues were up 33%, our fastest growth rate in over three years, and earnings per share were up 45%. We achieved these incredibly strong results despite reducing channel inventories across our product lines by over 1 million units and despite the challenging FX environment. Revenue exceeded the high end of our guidance by $1.6 billion as we topped our internal expectations for sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple Watch. We had another stellar quarter for iPhone, establishing a new June quarter record. iPhone unit sales grew 35%, which is almost three times the rate of growth of the smartphone market overall and we gained share in all of our geographic segments. iPhone revenue grew even more strongly, up 59%. The strong iPhone results were broad-based in both developed and emerging markets and we experienced the highest switcher rate from Android that we've ever measured. Most importantly, iPhone customer metrics are tremendous. ChangeWave's most recent survey of US customers found that iPhone has the highest customer satisfaction rate of any smartphone brand by a wide margin, and that among iPhone owners planning to purchase a new phone, 86% plan to purchase another iPhone. That compares to 50% repurchase intent for the next highest brand measured. We also had a tremendous record quarter for Mac, continuing to defy the industry trend with unit growth of 9% in a market that IDC estimates contracted by 12%. Growth was fueled by great response to our new MacBook and we're working hard to catch up with customer demand. We generated over $5 billion in services revenue, setting a new all-time record. Within services, the App Store produced its best quarter ever with revenue growing 24%. Our results from Greater China were outstanding with revenue growth of 112% and iPhone unit growth of 87%. This is particularly impressive given IDC's estimate of only 5% growth for the Greater China smartphone market. We also achieved our highest ever PC market share in the segment with Mac sales growing 33% over last year. And our ecosystem in China continues to grow at a very fast pace, with App Store revenue more than doubling in the quarter. Luca will go into more detail on our product and financial results in a moment. A major highlight of the past quarter for all of us here at Apple was the launch of Apple Watch in April. As you know, we've been very excited to get this revolutionary product to customers. We started taking preorders in nine countries on April 10, and demand immediately exceeded supply by a wide margin. To prioritize those first orders and to deliver the best experience for our customers, we delayed the availability of Apple Watch in our own retail stores until mid June. We made huge progress with the production ramp across the quarter and near the end of the quarter expanded into six additional countries. And in just the past few days, we've been able to catch up with demand, enabling us to expand Apple Watch availability to a total of 19 countries currently with three more countries to be added at the end of this month. The feedback from Apple Watch customers is incredibly positive and we've been very happy with customer satisfaction and usage statistics. Market research from Wristly measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for Apple Watch and we hear from people every day about the impact it's having on their health, their daily routines, and how they communicate. Our own market research shows that 94% of Apple Watch owners wear and use it regularly, if not every day. Messaging and activity features are among the most popular and social networking apps including Twitter, WeChat and LINE are seeing the most usage among third party apps. We believe that the possibilities for Apple Watch are enormous and that's been reinforced in just the first few weeks since it became available to customers. For example, doctors and researchers at leading hospitals in the US and Europe are already putting Apple Watch to work in improving patients' lives. Nebraska Medicine, the latest hospital to adopt Apple Watch, has rolled out new apps that facilitate communication between patients and doctors and provide quick access to important chart and dosage information. Ochsner Health System of Louisiana is using Apple Watch with hypertension patients to gather important information like daily activity and blood pressure level, and leading cancer centers like London King's College Hospital are incorporating Apple Watch into trials for ongoing care and monitoring of cancer patients. Great Apple Watch solutions go well beyond healthcare. Users are tracking their fitness, getting breaking news alerts, following their investments, connecting with friends, and living a healthier day. The user experience for Apple Pay and Siri is nothing short of incredible and customers are enjoying countless other features through the over 8,500 third-party apps available for Apple Watch. This is just the beginning of what this new platform can deliver. With Apple watchOS 2, developers now have the ability to build richer and more powerful native apps for Apple Watch, taking advantage of the heart rate sensor, the Digital Crown, accelerometer and more, ushering in a whole new class of apps designed specifically for the wrist. It's a rare and special privilege to launch a new platform with such promise and potential, and I know I speak for everyone at Apple when I say that we can't wait to see what our developers and customers do with it. We hosted a fantastic developers' conference in June with thousands of attendees from 70 countries coming together with Apple engineers to share in the excitement of our three operating systems, OS X, iOS, and watchOS. We've been working hard to make our products even more intelligent, more powerful and more meaningful in all aspects of our customers' lives, while adding new continuity features to make the experience across our devices more seamless than ever and preserving the security and privacy that our customers deserve. Public betas of OS X El Capitan and iOS 9 are available now and customer versions of all three updated OSs are on schedule and will be delivered in the fall. We're very excited about our news app coming to iPhone and iPad with iOS 9. We believe it will be the best news reading experience on any mobile device, combining a beautiful magazine layout with real-time customized digital media content. News will follow over a million topics and pull relevant stories based on the user's specific interests without compromising their privacy. We've already signed 25 leading publishers, representing more than 75 of the world's most influential news, sports, business and magazine titles, including CNN, the New York Times, the Financial Times, ESPN, Bloomberg Business, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Hearst, Reuters, Time, Inc. and The Daily Telegraph. The September quarter is off to an exciting start. We're thrilled by the response to Apple Music, which launched in over 100 countries on June 30. Apple Music is a single immersive app that combines the best ways to enjoy music all in one place. It's an incredible streaming music service, a pioneering worldwide live radio station broadcasting 24 hours a day, and a great place for music fans to connect with their favorite artist. Customers and reviewers love the human curation features of Apple Music and the way it's helping people discover new music. Millions and millions of customers are already experiencing the new service using the three-month trial period, and the numbers are growing substantially every day. Over 15,000 artists have signed up to post on Connect, where we are already seeing great original content, including a world premiere video by Drake. Millions of listeners around the world are tuning in to Beats 1, the first of its kind worldwide radio station featuring some of the most talented and passionate music lovers on the planet. This all adds up to a renewed sense of excitement around music, which we love and expect to continue as Apple Music gets traction with customers. Last week we launched Apple Pay in the UK, bringing customers our easy, secure and private way to pay. On day one, we had an incredible roster of over 250,000 locations and major credit and debit cards from many of the UK's most established banks supporting Apple Pay. Customers are using Apple Pay to ride the London Underground as well as the over ground systems of Transport for London and we hope this will be a model for other public transportation systems around the world. In the US, we've seen fantastic support from merchants of all sizes. We are excited to see this momentum continue with the new Square reader coming this fall. It will bring Apple Pay to even more neighborhood businesses where you pay every day, from your corner coffee shop to your local farmer's market, bolstering the 80,000 small- and medium-size businesses we're already adding every month. American Express will add Apple Pay support for its robust portfolio of corporate cards next month, offering businesses and their employees a new way to make easy and secure payments. And as we head into the school year, 700 universities and colleges across the US will accept Apple Pay such as Auburn University, the University of California Irvine, Colorado State University, the University of Kentucky and the University of Oklahoma, among many others. We're on track for Apple Pay acceptance at over 1.5 million US locations by the end of 2015. I'd like to thank our customers, developers, business partners and employees for another record breaking quarter. We're very hard at work on our exciting pipeline of new hardware, software and services, and we're continuing to expand our global reach into new markets. And we're passionately committed to leaving the world better than we found it. With that, I'll turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As we have done for the first half of our fiscal 2015, we are reporting another record quarter today. Revenue for the June quarter was $49.6 billion, an increase of $12.2 billion or 33% year over year. Our growth was driven by the tremendous performance of iPhone, the introduction of Apple Watch and the continued strength of Mac and App Store sales. We achieved these great results in the context of a very challenging foreign exchange environment around the world and a reduction in channel inventory of over 1 million units across our product lines, which makes our growth performance even more remarkable. As Tim mentioned, our results were especially impressive in Greater China, where revenue more than doubled year over year to over $13 billion. Emerging markets overall grew 79% to almost $18 billion and represented 35% of our total company revenue. Company gross margin was 39.7%, better than our expectations, mainly due to strong iPhone sales. Operating margin was 28.4% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion, a new June quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $1.85, a 45% year-over-year increase and cash flow from operations was $15 billion, also a new third quarter record. For details by product I'll start with iPhone. We sold 47.5 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 35% year over year growth and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus has continued to be terrific all around the world. iPhone sales more than doubled in Germany, Korea, Malaysia, and Vietnam. We're up over 85% in Greater China and in India, and increased more than 45% in several countries including Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey. The strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus led to an iPhone ASP of $660, an increase of $99 year over year, despite the significant negative foreign exchange impact I referred to earlier. We reduced iPhone channel inventory by about 600,000 units during the quarter, which left us at the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.8 million Macs, representing 9% year-over-year growth. As we have done for several years in a row, we continued to gain significant market share based on IDC's latest estimate of a 12% global PC market contraction. Mac growth was driven by portables and we are delighted with the very strong customer reception of our new MacBook. We ended the quarter slightly below our 4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad. We sold 10.9 million compared to 13.3 million in the year-ago quarter. iPad sell-through was 11.2 million as we reduced channel inventory by about 300,000 units. This left us within our 5 to 7 week target range of iPad channel inventory. iPad customer metrics continue to be extremely positive. ChangeWave recently measured a 97% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within 90 days, over half plan to purchase an iPad. For corporate buyers, the purchase intent was even stronger at over 70%. We do not participate in the low end of the tablet market, but we are extremely successful where we do compete. NPD recently indicated that iPad has 76% share of the US market for tablets priced above $200. We're very excited about the advances in the iPad experience coming in iOS 9 in the fall, including the slide over and split view features for retail multitasking, picture-in-picture for FaceTime and video, and enhanced QuickType for composing text even faster. We're also seeing great momentum in the enterprise market. For instance, riding on the success of iPad use by its pilots, United Airlines has not only renewed its iPad program with more than 10,000 iPad Air 2s, but has also made a strategic decision to provide iPhones to over 20,000 flight attendants. In the near future, United plans to introduce new apps to transform the customer experience and improve integration with flight operations. We're also very happy with the progress of our IBM partnership. IBM released 13 new MobileFirst for iOS apps in the June quarter, including new apps in retail banking and healthcare, as well as new horizontal apps for HR and sales. There are now 35 apps in IBM's MobileFirst for iOS catalog that connect users to big data and analytics right on their iPads or iPhones. And we expect a total of 100 apps to be available by the end of 2015. Active customer engagements have also grown to over 500 and recent notable customer wins include Air Canada, National Grid in the UK and Banorte in Mexico. In April, Apple, IBM and Japan Post announced a joint initiative to deliver iPads with IBM developed apps and analytics to connect Japanese senior citizens with services, healthcare, community and family. Japan Post hopes to reach 4 million to 5 million Japanese customers with these solutions by 2020. Since announcing this initiative less than three months ago, we've already seen strong interest from other countries looking for innovative ways to support an aging population. Importantly, we also continue to work closely with leading business software and solution providers to help businesses of all sizes transform work with iPad and iPhone. The number of these mobility partners has expanded rapidly to over 40. They're developing new and differentiated solutions on iOS across many industries, and attracting very significant customer interest. Turning to services. We generated over $5 billion in revenue, a new all-time record, and an increase of 12% over last year thanks primarily to strong growth from apps. The revenue from the App Store increased 24% and the number of transacting customers grew 19%, also setting an all-time record. Services growth was particularly strong in China, where the App Store revenue more than doubled year over year. China based developers have created 250,000 apps for our China App Store and the response from our customers has been tremendous. The revenue from other products grew sharply, up 49% over last year. The contribution from Apple Watch accounted for well over 100% of the growth of the category, and more than offset the decline of iPod and accessory sales. As we've said in the past, we do not plan to disclose Apple Watch metrics because we don't intend to provide insight that could help our competitors. Our retail and online stores had a very busy quarter, with customer visits up 49% year-over-year, driven especially by the very strong interest in Apple Watch. Thanks to our very popular Apple Store app, mobile traffic to our online stores during the quarter equaled desktop traffic for the first time ever. We opened three new stores, our second store in Brazil, our sixth store in Manhattan, and our twenty-second store in Greater China. That brought us to a global store count of 456, of which 190 are outside the United States, and we are on track to have 40 stores open in Greater China by the middle of next year. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $202.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $9.3 billion. $181 billion of this cash, or 89% of the total, was offshore. In the June quarter, we issued a total of $10 billion of term debt, consisting of $8 billion US dollar denominated notes and \u00a5250 billion denominated notes as we continue to diversify our global debt investor base. This left us with $50 billion of term debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we turned over $13 billion to our investors. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $4 billion to repurchase 31.2 million Apple shares to open market transactions. We also launched a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May and received an initial delivery of 38.3 million shares. The purchase period for the new ASR will end in or before November of 2015. We have continued to execute our capital return program at a fast pace and we now take an action on over $126 billion of our $200 billion program, including $90 billion in share repurchases. The weighted average price for all open market purchases and completed ASR programs to date is $86. Now as we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $49 billion and $51 billion compared to $42.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $5.850 billion and $5.950 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%. Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2015 to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2015. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: We ask that you limit yourself to one, one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operation Instructions] First we will hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. While the year on year iPhone growth was very attractive, the sequential unit decline in the June quarter was worse than the past two years. Why do you think that was, and in particular, why drain channel inventory when iPhone 6 is selling so well? And then I have a follow-up.\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Katy, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned, the channel inventory did go down by 600,000. We sold more units than we thought we would and so that was a part of that. The other part of it is that we always run with just the amount of inventory that we think we need. And so to the degree that sales are distributed in the countries with disproportionally with shorter supply chains, or the standard deviation demand is less, we would always choose to have less. And so in this particular quarter, we were able to end basically right at the bottom end of our range and we view that as a good thing, not a bad thing. Obviously the revenues could have been much higher if we would have expanded the channel, but if you don't need to do that, that's not how we think about the business. We run the business for the long term, not the 90-day clock. In terms of what's going on with iPhone, the 35% growth is almost three times the market. And if you look at it at a little narrower regional level, Western Europe grew 30% versus a market of 7%, so four times market. Japan grew over five times market. We doubled in Korea versus a market that was shrinking. And India we grew at 93% and this is on top of the Greater China numbers that we've already covered that grew 87% during the quarter against a market of 5%. And so we did exceptionally well I think in any way that you look at it. In terms of the percentage of customers that have upgraded to a 6 and 6 Plus versus that have not upgraded, it's 73%, or meaning that 27% of the installed base of customers prior to the launch of 6 and 6 Plus have now upgraded. And so we view that as a very bullish sign on the future, that there's a lot of headroom left for upgraders. We also are incredibly happy to see the highest Android switcher rate that we've observed. And so from our point of view, the iPhone is doing outstanding.\nKathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: So Tim, just to extend that conversation to the longer term, as I'm sure you're aware, you're lapping some pretty significant comps as it relates to the upgrades that you're talking about as well as significant growth in China. What is the framework that you use to convince yourselves that iPhone units can continue to grow over the longer term?\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well you know, Katy, we purposely just give guidance for the current quarter and we've done that. And obviously the kind of numbers that we have indicated growth in the revenue means that iPhone would have another stellar quarter. And so we're very confident that this quarter is going to be great. How the future looks, we'll take it one quarter at a time. But as I back up from it and look at it more from a macro point of view, the things that makes me very bullish is the 27% number I just quoted, the fact that we are seeing the highest Android switcher rate, the customer satisfaction that we have on the iPhone versus the competition. It's a huge margin. The loyalty rate that we have versus competition, an enormous gap there. I also look at the first time iPhone buyers and we're still seeing very, very large numbers in the countries that you would want to see those in, like China and Russia and Brazil and so forth. I also see a market that over a five-year horizon, if you look at the IDC numbers, is projected to grow from 1.3 million in 2014 to over 1.9 billion \u2013 this is billion, rather, billion in 2019. And so it's an incredible market. I think everybody's going to own a smartphone, and I think we've proven that we can compete for a fair number of those, as you can see from our results.\nKathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.\nWilliam C. Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thank you. Could you walk us through the key factors behind your gross margin range for the September quarter and in particular how we should think about the sequential ForEx impact this quarter and the impact of a potential product transition cost?\nLuca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Definitely. This is Luca. So we got into 38.5% to 39.5%, and so just keep in mind last year in Q4, our gross margin declined by 140 basis points sequentially. So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points. I would point to three main factors for the decline. First of all, to your point around foreign exchange, it continues to be a challenging environment given the strengthening of the US dollar. In our case, the impact on margin after the hedges is going to be about 30 basis points for Q4. Also, I want to point to a different mix, which is typical of our seasonality as we enter the back-to-school season during Q4. And thirdly, the transition cost that you've mentioned as we prepare for a busy fall. And so those are the three factors that will have an impact on gross margin sequentially. I would point that in general costs continue to be, particularly commodity costs continue to be favorable and so there would be a partial offset to the factors that I mentioned.\nWilliam C. Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thanks. And then could you give us a bit more color on the mix dynamics for the iPhone in the June quarter and how this compares to prior generations and your expectations? Obviously there continues to be an upward bias helping the ASPs as you mentioned, but could you give us a bit more detail on what exactly you're seeing here? Particularly I think it's interesting in the context of a continued tilt towards the emerging regions obviously.\nLuca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, so as we mentioned, the ASP for iPhone was up $99, 18% increase year-over-year and this is really driven by the mix, by the fact that we've added iPhone 6 Plus to a new price point and in general, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio. And keep in mind that this $99 was partially offset by $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange. So the number would have been even better. So yes, clearly 6 and 6 Plus. And I think we talked about it in prior calls, the 6 Plus is doing particularly well in the markets that you would expect, Greater China, other Asian markets. Those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and the 6 Plus, because of the screen size, is doing extremely well.\nWilliam C. Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nEugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Hi, good afternoon. Luca, you talked a little bit about gross margins in the previous question. But could you talk about how we should think about the trends in the gross margin? In other words is, should the margin trends that we've seen in other cycles continue into next year? And then a follow-up or another question for Tim here, is that the Watch has been under a lot of interest from investors and some may have wanted a little bit more. You outlined some of the opportunities and some of the progress you've had. But any thoughts that you have for investors who may say that the category is just not taking off as fast as they would have hoped?\nLuca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Okay Gene, let me start with gross margin. As Tim said before, obviously we guide to the current quarter. You know, as we look at it at a macro level. I think there are, you know every cycle is different for a variety of reasons. There are also things that are not necessarily within our control. So for example, currency markets can be very different one year to the next. We know that the next year is going to represent an additional challenge given where the dollar has moved. Commodity markets may be very different from one year to the other. There are things that remain relatively similar as we launch new products. For example, we innovate the products. We want to make them better all the time, and that typically requires additional cost and so the cost structures of our products, new products, tend to be higher than the products that they replace. Having said that, as you know we've got a very, very good track record to reduce those cost factors over the lifecycle of the products. I think this should give you a bit of color. Of course maybe the one thing that I want to point out again as we get into the following year, is that of course currency will be an issue.\nEugene C. Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah Gene, this is Tim. Let me talk about the Watch some. As you know, we made a decision back in September, quite several months ago not to disclose the shipments on the Watch and that was not a matter of not being transparent, it was a matter of not giving our competition insight that's a product that we've worked really hard on. However, let me give you some color so to avoid reaching sort of a wrong conclusion. If you look at the other products category and look at the revenue in this category, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year over year change and assume that were the total Watch revenue because the aggregate balance of that category, both sequentially and year over year, is shrinking. Obviously iPod is a part of that, but there are other things in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking. Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter. And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad. And we were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale. And as you probably know, as I had reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid-June. And so those points of sale pretty much, the overwhelming majority of the low numbers of sales were not there until the last two weeks of the quarter. And so as I look at all of these things, we feel really great about how we did. Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales. Beyond the very good news on sales, we're more excited about how the product is positioned for the long term because we're starting a new category. And as I back up and look at this, we have 8,500 apps. We've already announced the next operating system, watchOS 2. It will bring native apps which are going to be killer to the Watch. Even though the store layout was delayed, we've learned a lot about the buying experience. Based on that experience, we're now planning to expand our channel before the holiday because we're convinced that the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season. Now most importantly of all of this is that customer sat is off the charts because we've constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off the charts you can wind up doing fairly well over time. We've also learned a lot about managing quite an assortment and so forth. And so I sort of back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered and I know I never go anywhere without the Watch and it's not because I'm the CEO of Apple. I'm that attached to it and I get lots of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way. And so that's how I look at the Watch.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thanks, Gene. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Bernstein we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. Luca, I think in your prepared remarks you talked a little bit about your market share of iPad in the US above $200 being 78%. And I'm wondering if you think about the iPhone and your market share in the premium category, how do you think about it? So I've seen market data that says 60% market share for phones above $300 or you have actually 90% market share for phones above $600. And I'm wondering if, Tim or Luca, you could maybe talk about how you think about your market share, where you play given that your ASP is comfortably above $600? What do you think your market share is above $500 or $600 in smartphones? And how do we think about that, that market share going forward?\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Toni, it's Tim. We look at it a bit differently than you do. We look at it as our job is to grow our products regardless of the price, which means that we need to convince in some cases people to move from one price band to the other. And that we think if we do a great job with the product that people will be willing to spend more because they get so much more out of it. And I think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action. I mean, we grew 87% in China. We grew 90%-plus in India. Emerging markets are growing 65%. These numbers are unbelievable and they're done in an environment where it's not the best of conditions. So that's how we look at. We don't do the MBA analysis of there's only X people buying in a price band and therefore we can only get X minus Y percent. That's not the way we've ever looked at it. If we did, we wouldn't be shipping any products.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Tim, I'm asking in part because you talked about the highest ever Android switcher. So I'm wondering if indeed your goal of expanding the category is happening or whether you are taking share and how do you measure the relative contribution of each of those in your success. So is the strength and the dramatically above market growth because you're taking share in that high-end category and how far along are you there? Or can you point to proof points that you've actually expanded the size of the market for products of your price point?\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Oh, I think there's no doubt if you look at it we are expanding the market size in those areas. It's also true that there's some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great too. But I think the answer is that both of those things are happening and it's key that we do both, not just one.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then if I could just ask you to comment on how you think about replacement cycles with the current iPhone 6 cycle. So when you look at replacement cycles over the last three quarters, are they similar to what you saw one and two years ago when you think about replacement? And one of the things that also sort of struck me was I think you cited market research having repurchase intention of 86% versus your competitors at 50%. Quite frankly, the 86% sounds low to me. Is that actually consistent with what you see in the marketplace, about 86% of iPhone buyers ultimately buy another iPhone? So perhaps we can think about replacement cycle.\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And how that's changed and the percentage number and how that jives with reality?\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The 86% also seems low to me but I was quoting a third-party source and not our own data. Our own data would look better than that. But the numbers are only comparable if I quote the third-party source for both and so that's what I'm doing. On the upgrade cycle and what we're seeing, it's not remarkably different. However, there's a number of plans that people began signing up for in the last year that could change it. These are upgrade any time kind of plans. They may be one year leases that could actually help the upgrade rate. And I think it'll be interesting to see how that plays out over the next horizon. But generally speaking, I see positive vectors there, not negative, in the aggregate.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thank you, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Jim Suva with Citi.\nJames D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. As you look at many of your products have been absolutely fantastic and at different phases in their life, they've seen tremendous high growth, whether it's iPad, iPhone, iPod, and iPhone looks like it's facing some very challenging comps here in the next few quarters. Does this make you shift even more strategic focus into broadening the reliance on a couple products such as you mentioned Apple Radio. There's a lot more content on the Apple Watch and apps and then also Apple Pay. Are you increasingly focusing on hiring and kind of non hardware things (45:32)? Or are these kind of more peripheral activities and still the focus is kind of right now on the phone?\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Jim, it's Tim. We think the phone has a lot of legs to it. I mean, many, many, many years. There's tons of innovation left at the phone. I think we're in the early innings of it, not in the late innings, and I think the market rate of growth over the long haul will also be impressive. And so there will be multiple winners here. And so that's how I see it. In terms of the other things that we're doing, we have some great capability and great teams in Apple. And so we can do more than one thing, and so we have other things that we're working on as well. But at the aggregate level, we still remain very focused because if you look at our size versus the number of projects we have going, it's much smaller compared to most. But that's how we do things and that's how we get the level of quality that we want out of each one of those. And so the other things that you named, whether it be Apple Music or Apple Pay, both of these are very important to us. And things that you didn't mention, the Mac continues to perform very well. I am still bullish on iPad. We've gotten with iOS 9, there's some incredible productivity enhancements coming in with split view and slide over and picture-in-picture. These things are incredible features. The enterprise business is clearly picking up and more and more companies are either contracting for or writing apps themselves. I think and I believe that the iPad consumer upgrade cycle will eventually occur because as we look at the usage statistics on iPad, it remains unbelievably great. I mean, the next closest usage of the next competitor, we're six times greater. And so these are extraordinary numbers. It's not like people have forgotten iPad or anything. It's a fantastic product. So I see a lot of runway. And as I look geographically, where we've been doing really good in the emerging markets, our share is still not high in any of them, and so there's a lot of headroom there as well, as there is in most developed markets as well. And so I look around, I see opportunity left and right. And that's what we're focused on.\nJames D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you so much.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thanks, Jim. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UBS.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Tim, there's some concern about what's going on in China with the stock market and economically. How do you think that plays out for Apple? On one hand you've got more stores, broader distribution, the 4G infrastructure is playing out. On the other hand, the economy might be weakening. Is a phone a discretionary purchase or not? How do you think about going forward in China?\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, it's a very good question, and we remain extremely bullish on China and we're continuing to invest. Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future. It's true, as you point out, that the equity markets have recently been volatile. This could create some speed bumps in the near term. But to put it in context, which I think is important, despite that volatility in the Chinese market, they're still up 90% over the last year, and they're up 20% year-to-date, and so these kind of numbers are numbers I think all of us would love. Also, the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly narrow. And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might. And so I think generally this has been, at least as we see it, maybe it's not true for other businesses, that this worry is probably overstated. And so we're not changing anything. We have the pedal to the metal on getting to 40 stores mid next year. As we had talked about before, we're continuing to expand the indirect channel as well. As you point out, and I think this is a major point that many people miss, the LTE penetration in China is only at 12%. And China doesn't possess the level of fiber that some other countries do, and so in order to get the great video performance, et cetera, raising that penetration is really great. I think that really plays to an incredible smartphone future there. Also, and I can't underestimate \u2013 I can't overstate this. The rise of the middle class there is continuing, and it is transforming China. McKinsey, I saw a recent study from McKinsey that's projecting the upper middle class to grow from 14% to 54% of households over the ten-year period from 2012 to 2022. So we're within that period at this moment, and you can see for all of us that travel there so much, with every trip you can see this occurring. And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans. I think China is a fantastic geography with an incredible unprecedented level of opportunity there. And we're going to be there.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: I also wanted to ask, can you give us any more detail on the switching rate, how much is it up? And I noticed in your advertising there's the shift to the, if it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone. And I assume that while you're not as involved as Jobs was, you're approving these ads. So it seems like you're really focused on market share gain right now.\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, I'm very familiar with the ads. In certain geographies, the way that we win is to get switchers. In other geographies, the way that we win is to get people to buy their first smartphone. In other geographies, the way that we win is to get people to upgrade from their current iPhone. And all of those are very important for us. In many geographies, it's two of those or in some geographies it's all three of those. And so all of those are important. We are very focused on growing iPhone around the world, not just in one geography and getting our message out there through ads is one way to do that.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And that'll come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much. I wanted to talk about FX but not necessarily from a direct impact. But what are you seeing in terms of demand as you've raised prices in various geographies and how are you thinking about it as you go into sort of the next iPhone cycle in terms of having to sort of normalize the pricing for what some of the currencies have done over the past year?\nLuca Maestri - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer: Yes, Shannon. So obviously FX has been a significant hit in many ways, of course. I mean it reduces our growth rate. We would be 800 basis points higher this quarter from the 33% that we've reported if it wasn't for the movement in currencies around the world. And really when you look around the world, it's really if you exclude China, essentially every single currency has weakened against the dollar. We are pretty careful and thoughtful about where we increase prices and when and by how much during mid-cycle because it's not something that we particularly like to do. We've had circumstances around the world this year where frankly we didn't have many options because the currency movement was so large and so we've had to reprice. I have to say that it's been remarkable. Look, in the long run a strong US dollar is not a positive for our international business. It's normal to see a drop in demand when prices go up. That goes without saying. It has been remarkable so far to see that we did take prices in a few markets. But really remarkable to see how resilient iPhone sales have been, because we have increased, in spite of these price increases, we've increased sales and we've increased market share in all our geographies around the world, without exception.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Great. And then can you talk a bit about linearity during the quarter on a geographic basis? Somewhat going back to the China question, I mean did you see it slow down toward the end of the quarter? Or was it solid through it? And just any other color you can give geographically with Europe and some of the other macro events that are going on.\nTimothy D. Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Shannon, it's Tim. Maybe the best way to talk about this is sort of at the product level. On the Watch, our June sales were higher than April or May. I realize that's very different than what some of the, is being written, but the June sales were the highest. And so the Watch had a more of a back-ended kind of a skewing. The phone itself followed what I would call a normal seasonal kind of pattern. And if you look at the \u2013 it sounds like you're honing in on the Greater China results themselves. There is no obvious impact from the last quarter in the Greater China numbers. And obviously with the aggregate or the consolidated number being 112%, it's hard to find a lot of bad things in the numbers.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thank you, Shannon.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes store, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we\u2019ll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for dividends, share repurchases, and public debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2014, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2015, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press releases. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot of great news to talk about, so I\u2019ll jump right in. Today, we\u2019re reporting our strongest March quarter ever, with 27% revenue growth and 40% earnings per share growth year over year. We\u2019re seeing fantastic results for iPhone, with revenue growth of 55% year on year, and we\u2019re seeing a higher rate of switchers than we\u2019ve experienced in previous iPhone cycles. The success of iPhone has been extremely strong in emerging markets, where unit sales were up 63% year on year. The App Store had its best quarter ever, with a record number of customers making purchases, driving a new record for revenue and 29% year on year growth. We also reached an all-time quarterly record of $5 billion in total services revenue. We also continue to defy the trend of declining global PC sales, with double digit Mac unit growth in a market that IVC estimates contracted by 7%. We\u2019re now halfway through fiscal 2015 and our year to date results have been simply staggering. We sold over 135 million iPhones, 34 million iPads, and 10 million Macs in the first six months of the year. Our revenue has grown by 28% to over $132 billion, net income has increased 36% to over $31 billion, and EPS has grown by 44%. We\u2019re making many strategic investments in Apple\u2019s future, in research and development, in our supply chain, and in our infrastructure, and we\u2019ve made 27 acquisitions in the last six quarters. We\u2019re in the very fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business, and keep making these important investments. So today, we\u2019re announcing another significant update to our capital return program, expanding its size to $200 billion through March of 2017 to reflect our strong confidence in what lies ahead for Apple. Luca will go into this in more detail in a moment. We\u2019re also making great progress in many other areas. The Apple ecosystem continues to expand in exciting ways. We\u2019re seeing great momentum with Apple Pay. Discover announced today that its cardmembers in the United States will be able to make contactless payments in participating stores through Apple Pay beginning this fall. And last month, we said that the number of locations accepting Apple Pay has tripled, and we continue to see great progress with merchants. Best Buy, which has been a longtime, strong partner of ours, has just announced that it\u2019s now offering Apple Pay in-app and later this year will offer Apple Pay in all of their U.S. stores. And merchants aren\u2019t the only ones jumping onboard. Earlier this month, a leading healthcare payment network announced acceptance of Apple Pay for its clients, so over 50 major hospitals across the country, including Stanford Healthcare and Aspen Valley, will accept Apple Pay this year for copays and bill payments at registration and check in. We\u2019re also incredibly inspired by the momentum we\u2019re seeing in health-related solutions. Since we released HealthKit with iOS 8 last September, over 1,000 apps have been developed to transform how people track, manage, and interact with their health and they\u2019re now available on the App Store. Just this past weekend, Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles turned on the largest HealthKit integration to date, giving more than 87,000 patients the ability to share their health and fitness data seamlessly with their MyCS link app, which syncs with their electronic medical record. And last month we announced ResearchKit, an open source software framework that helps doctors and scientists gather data from medical research participants more efficiently and accurately using iPhone applications. The response so far has been simply amazing, far exceeding our expectations. The first research apps developed using ResearchKit study asthma, breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and have enrolled over 60,000 iPhone users in just the first few weeks of being available on the App Store. Over 1,000 researchers have contacted us expressing interest in performing studies through ResearchKit. We think these types of solutions have the potential to revolutionize medical studies in life-changing ways, and we\u2019re proud that Apple is helping make this possible. Last quarter, we also announced a major economic investment in Europe, where we will spend $2 billion to build data centers in Ireland and Denmark. These will be our largest data centers in the world. Apple is now responsible for creating over 670,000 jobs across the European continent. Most of them have grown out of the success of the App Store, which has generated more than $7.5 billion for European developers since just 2008. We feel great about the economic contribution we\u2019ve been able to make in Europe. The two data centers we\u2019re building will run on 100% renewable energy from day one. This is just part of the work we\u2019re doing to protect the environment and leave the world better than we found it. Today, 100% of Apple\u2019s U.S. operations and 87% of global operations are powered by renewable energy. Just before Earth Day, we announced our plan to move to renewables in China. We\u2019re undertaking a groundbreaking partnership with several companies to build a 40 megawatt solar farm in Szechuan Province that will generate far more than the amount of energy used by all of our offices and retail stores in China combined. We also announced an innovative new partnership with the Conservation Fund to permanently protect more than 36,000 acres of working forest in Maine and North Carolina to help offset the impact our packaging has on the world\u2019s supply of sustainable virgin fiber. Apple is deeply committed to these initiatives and will continue to make them a priority. The June quarter is off to an exciting start with great new products and services. Three of them in particular are giving our customers a glimpse of the future and we are very happy with the reception that each of them is receiving. First, the all-new MacBook began shipping just over two weeks ago, and we are very happy with the response we\u2019re getting from customers. The new MacBook is our lightest, most compact Mac notebook ever, and you really have to see it to believe it. It features a stunning 12 inch retina display, a new force touch trackpad, all day battery life, and a revolutionary new keyboard. We believe, and I think most everyone agrees, this is the future of the notebook. Second is the new streaming service from HBO, which is available on Apple TV and iOS. We teamed up with HBO last month to help launch HBO Now, a standalone service that lets customers stream the content they love from HBO on the devices they love from Apple, all without requiring a subscription to cable. HBO now has been incredibly popular with Apple TV users since its debut, and it has been one of the top downloaded apps on the U.S. App Store as well. And third, of course, is Apple Watch. It\u2019s been really great to see the reaction of customers since their watches began arriving on Friday morning. All around the world, we\u2019ve seen the excitement on social networks as people start using their Apple Watch. The response has been overwhelmingly positive. Adding to the surprise and delight of Apple Watch are the more than 3,500 apps that are already available. Our developer community has already seen the potential in this new category and put some of their best thinking into what wearable technology can do. We can\u2019t wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up for Apple Watch as we head into our Worldwide Developer Conference six weeks from now. I\u2019d like to thank all of those developers and our hundreds of millions of customers for their loyalty and support. I\u2019d also like to thank all of the Apple employees around the world for their creativity, tireless effort, and passion for delivering the very best products in the world. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri : Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. As Tim mentioned, we just completed another outstanding quarter. Revenue for the March quarter was $58 billion, an increase of $12.4 billion or 27% year over year. Growth was driven primarily by the very strong performance of iPhone and the continued strength of the App Store and Mac sales. We achieved these terrific results despite growing foreign exchange headwinds. Our performance was particularly impressive in our Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific segments. In Greater China, we established an all-time quarterly record for revenue, which grew 71% year over year, to $16.8 billion. Gross margin was 40.8%, ahead of our expectations, mainly due to stronger than expected iPhone results. Operating margin was 31.5% of revenue and net income was $13.6 billion, a new Q2 record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.33, a 40% year over year increase, and cash flow from operations was $19.1 billion, also a new March quarter record. For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 40% year over year growth and demand for iPhone 6 and 6 plus has remained incredibly strong. IPhone sales more than doubled in Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam, and they were up 80% or more in several other markets including Canada, Mexico, Germany, and Turkey. The strong mix of iPhone 6 and 6 plus combined with the popularity of higher capacity offerings led to iPhone ASPs of $659, an increase of $62 year over year, despite the very significant foreign exchange headwinds I already mentioned. We increased iPhone channel inventory by 1 million units during the quarter, which allowed us to get into the low end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of channel inventory. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.6 million Macs, representing 10% year over year growth, which is particularly impressive in the context of IDC\u2019s latest estimate of a 7% global PC market contraction. The growth was led by portables and spurred by the updates to MacBook Air and MacBook Pro in March. We ended the quarter within our 4 to 5 week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 12.6 million, compared to 16.4 million in the year ago quarter. iPad sellthrough was 13.7 million, as we reduced channel inventory by about 1.1 million units, coming off the holiday quarter. This left us within our 5 to 7 week target range of iPad channel inventory. We set a new March quarter record for iPad sales in Japan, and an all-time record for iPad sales in China, but performance in other markets was more muted during the quarter. iPad turns five years old this month, and in every year since its introduction, it has been the number one tablet in sales, in quantity and quality of tablet apps, in usage, and most importantly, in customer satisfaction. And based on the latest data from NPD, iPad maintains a very strong leadership share in all the price bands where we compete. iPad has also consistently been the number one tablet in enterprise. A recent Changewave survey found that among corporate buyers planning to buy tablets in the next six months, 77% plan to purchase iPads. In fact, we are seeing very high interest from companies who want to use iPads to transform how work gets done. The vast majority of the app opportunities that have been identified as part of the Apple and IBM partnership are specifically for iPad. In addition to IBM, we working closely with more than two dozen other leading business software and solution providers including Box, Docusign, Microstrategy, Revel, and ServiceMax to bring a broad range of innovative mobile solutions to more customers on iPad. Turning to services, revenue grew to a new all-time record of $5 billion, an increase of 9% year over year. The growth was led by the App Store, which remains incredibly popular with our customers around the world, with revenue up 29% in the March quarter. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 70% more global revenue in the March quarter than Google Play, up from a 60% lead in the September quarter. Traffic to our retail and online stores was excellent, with a 22% year over year increase in customer visits. We\u2019re progressing well with our plans for retail store expansion in Greater China, where we added six new stores in the past quarter alone, bringing us to 21 stores in 11 cities. We\u2019re on track to have 40 stores open in Greater China by the middle of next year. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $193.5 billion in cash, plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $15.6 billion. Over $171 billion of this cash was offshore. In the March quarter, we issued 6.5 billion U.S. dollar denominated notes and 1.3 billion Swiss franc denominated notes as we continue to diversify our global debt investor base. We\u2019ve now raised a total of $40 billion of term debt at very attractive rates. We spent $7 billion to repurchase 56.4 million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid $2.7 billion in dividends and equivalents, and utilized about $100 million to [net share] settle vesting employee RSUs. We also retired an additional 13.3 million shares during the quarter, with the conclusion of the accelerated share repurchase program we launched last August. We have executed our capital return program aggressively, and we\u2019ve now taken action on over $112 billion of our $130 billion program, including $80 billion in share repurchases at an average price of $85. As we\u2019ve said consistently, creating value for shareholders by developing great products that enrich people\u2019s lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investments and our capital allocation decisions. With this framework in mind, Apple\u2019s board and management team continue to review capital allocation regularly, and we solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This process allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of the program. We very much appreciate all the input that many shareholders have provided us. We continue to be in the fortunate position of being able to return significant capital to shareholders. We first announced our capital return program three years ago with an initial size of $45 billion, and we\u2019ve increased it annually since then. Today, we\u2019re announcing the third update to our program, expanding its size by the largest amount yet and extending its duration. The existing program was set to conclude at the end of this calendar year, and we\u2019re now extending the program by five quarters to the end of March 2017. Once again, with this update we\u2019re allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases, given our strong confidence in the future of Apple and the value we see in our stock. The board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $50 billion, raising it from the current $90 billion to $140 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employee restricted stock units. We also understand that the dividend is very important to many of our investors and we\u2019re raising it for the third time in less than three years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.47 per share to $0.52 per share, an increase of 11%. This effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today and is payable on May 14, 2015 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2015. We believe this is a meaningful increase for those shareholders who value income, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With over $11 billion in annual dividend payments, we\u2019re proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, the size of our revised capital return program will increase by over 50%, from approximately $130 billion to $200 billion. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation, and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. And we plan to provide the next update on our program at about this time next year. Now, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $46 billion and $48 billion, compared to $37.4 billion in the year ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%. We expect opex to be between $5.65 billion and $5.75 billion. We expect YNE to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%. With that, let\u2019s open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton : Thank you, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator instructions.] Your first question will come from Bill Schultz, Goldman Sachs.\nQ \u2013 Bill Schultz: When we look at the effect of currency on your gross profit, which I think was far less than anyone anticipated, have you be able to reduce some of the pressure by adjusting the terms of your suppliers? Or is that something we should expect to see more of as you progress through the year?\nA \u2013 Luca Maestri : I\u2019m gonna give you some numbers on the currency, because I know it\u2019s a topic that is top of mind. You\u2019re asking about gross margin, and you know, we look at this on a sequential basis. And I mentioned during the call in January that we were expecting FX to have a negative impact on a sequential basis of about 100 basis points after the effect of the hedges. And that is exactly what happened in our actual results. So that was pretty much in line with what we were anticipating. Of course, we expect this headwind to continue. And on a sequential basis, when we look into the June quarter, we expect to see another 40 basis points of negative impact from currency. We\u2019re dealing with these headwinds. They\u2019re part of business, and so we\u2019re dealing with them in many ways. We are looking at, in some cases, at the potential to increase prices in certain markets. We\u2019re looking of course at our cost structure, and we try to remain as competitive as possible. So we feel very good about the gross margins that we\u2019ve generated in the March quarter, and we feel very good about the guidance that we provided, given the severity of the impact.\nQ \u2013 Bill Schultz: And then as a follow up, obviously, I guess one of the incremental tailwinds to gross margin continues to be the iPhone upside relative to expectations. Can you give us a bit more color on the dynamics of the customer mix for the iPhone? You had mentioned you\u2019re very excited about the new iPhone rate so far, but if you could just give us a bit more color, as we had last quarter, on folks that are new to iPhone, Android switchers, versus replacements?\nA \u2013 Tim Cook: Bill, we continue to see a higher rate of switchers than we have seen in previous cycles, and so we\u2019re extremely excited about that. We also continue to see a reasonable percentage of first time buyers, particularly in some of the emerging markets. And if you look at emerging markets in general, I think Luca covered some of this, the revenue from emerging markets, just for the March quarter, was up 58% year on year. And a big piece of what is driving that is iPhone. Obviously, those results would have been higher without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier.\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nQ \u2013 Katie Huberty: You\u2019ve said in the past that the watch may take longer to ramp given the new category and new interface to customers. Is that in fact playing out? Is the watch ramping slower than past product categories?\nA \u2013 Tim Cook : Katie, when you use the word \u201cramp,\u201d I assume you\u2019re talking about supply?\nQ \u2013 Katie Huberty : Yeah, preorders and first week in sales, and any other data points that you track in terms of interest versus, say, when the iPad launched in 2010.\nA \u2013 Tim Cook : Let me talk about supply and demand and sort of separate those two. Right now, demand is greater than supply. And so we\u2019re working hard to remedy that. We\u2019ve made progress over the last week or so, and we were able to deliver more customers an Apple Watch over the weekend than we had initially anticipated. We\u2019re going to keep doing that, and so we\u2019ve already sent some notes out today, moving the customers and versus what we had communicated to them previously. So I\u2019m generally happy that we\u2019re moving on with the ramp. It is a new product for us, and with any kind of new product, you wind up taking some time to fully ramp. Having said that, I think we\u2019re in a good position and by sometime in late June, we currently anticipate being in a position that we could begin to sell the Apple Watch in additional countries. And so that\u2019s our current plan. From a demand point of view, it\u2019s hard to gauge when you don\u2019t have product in stores and so forth. So we\u2019re filling orders completely online at the moment. The customer response from people that have gotten theirs over the weekend have been overwhelmingly positive, and we\u2019re far ahead of where we expected to be from an application point of view. To give you a comparison, when we launched the iPhone, we had about 500 apps that were ready. When we launched iPad, we had about a thousand. And so our internal goal was to be able to beat the thousand level, and we thought it would be great if we were able to do that by a little bit. And as I mentioned before, we now have over 3,500 apps in the App Store for the watch. And so we couldn\u2019t be happier about how things are going from that point of view. We are learning quickly about customer preferences between the different configurations. There\u2019s a much larger breadth of possibilities here for customers than in our other products. And in some cases, we called that well. In some cases, we\u2019re making adjustments to get in line with demand. But I\u2019m really confident that this is something we really understand how to do and will do. And so I\u2019m really happy where we are currently, and happy enough that we\u2019re looking forward to expanding into more countries in late June.\nQ \u2013 Katie Huberty : And then as a follow up, research and development spend continues to track well ahead of revenue growth. And that has happened for many quarters now. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that? Is there a broader set of projects that you\u2019re working on? Are you making bigger bets, entering bigger markets? What\u2019s driving such a long period of elevated R&D spend?\nA \u2013 Luca Maestri : Of course, we\u2019ve said this several times now. When you look at our current product portfolio, it is much broader than it used to be. We\u2019ve now developed two new iPhones over the year. We were not doing that a few years ago. Developed two iPads. And of course now we have the Apple Watch. We\u2019re also developing some core foundational technologies more in house now than we were in the past. And of course we\u2019re also spending ahead of some of the products that will generate revenues in the future. So when you combined all these factors, that is the reason why you see these research and development increases year over year. Research and development is the core of the company. Innovation is the core of the company. And we\u2019re very proud of the fact, when you look, for example, at the last two quarters, the first half of 2015, our revenue growth has been higher than our opex growth. And when you look at our expense to revenue ratio, which, for the first half of the year, has been 8.2%, it\u2019s lower than it was a year ago, and it\u2019s definitely something that we consider extremely competitive, and we\u2019re very proud of.\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we\u2019ll hear from Gene Munster.\nQ \u2013 Gene Munster: Tim, you mentioned there\u2019s more switchers versus previous cycles. Any thoughts on what that would mean or could mean for market share over the next few quarters, and kind of I guess the sustainability of the 6 cycle? And then second question, for Luca, in terms of any thoughts on what the margin impact from the watch is that ramps over the next couple of years?\nTim Cook : Gene, if you look at the overall worldwide, we grew iPhone 40%. And IDC\u2019s estimate of the market for last quarter is a 16%, so we grew two and a half times. And if you kind of look through at the different countries, in almost every country, we grew at a multiple of the market. And as I mentioned before, in emerging markets, we did extremely well. And so I feel really good about where we are, and you can hopefully tell with the strong guidance that we provided, that we\u2019re very bullish on the current quarter as well. And so I think things look very, very good. We\u2019re also pleased, in addition to the switcher number, that we\u2019re doing fairly well with first time buyers, which is also a key metric for us. And so it\u2019s tough to find something in the numbers not to like.\nLuca Maestri : And Gene, let me take your question on margins. I\u2019ll talk about Q3, because you know, this is the period that we provide guidance for. And we guided to 38.5% to 39.5%, which is slightly down versus our performance in Q2. And this is driven by a number of things. First of all, it\u2019s the loss of leverage from the sequential decline in revenue. This is typical of our seasonality. There\u2019s a foreign exchange element, and I mentioned before the negative impact on a sequential basis about 40 basis points. And also, we\u2019re launching the Apple Watch. Apple Watch is not only a new product, but it\u2019s a brand new category with a lot of new features, a lot of new, innovative technologies. And Apple Watch margins will be lower than company average.\nGene Munster : One maybe quick follow up, Tim, in terms of the base of iPhones that have upgraded. I think you provided a number last quarter on that. Is there any update to that metric?\nTim Cook : Yeah, sure. Our current estimate is that about 20% of the active installed base has upgraded to a 6 or 6 plus. And so as I look at that number, that suggests there\u2019s plenty of upgrade headroom in addition to we want to keep inviting over as many switchers as we can. So between both of those and the first time buyers as well, it seems really, really good right now.\nOperator: And that will come from Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.\nTony Sacconaghi: I just wanted to revisit the watch. Tim, I think you\u2019ve said, when you were talking about your new products, you said we\u2019re \u201cvery happy with the reception\u201d and in response to a previous answer, you said, \u201crelative to demand, it\u2019s hard to gauge with no product in the stores.\u201d I would say relative to other product launches, where your commentary around demand was characterized by superlative after superlative, that assessment feels very modest. And part of the reason that I ask is A) are we reading you right in terms of that, but if we look at consensus, consensus is expecting that Apple will ship more watches in its first two quarters than it did iPad, despite, as you said, very limited distribution in terms of only selling through your store. So I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about putting those demand comments in context given that they do seem different from how you\u2019ve characterized product demand for other products, and how, if at all, we should think about modeling demand in the context, perhaps, of the iPad, which was your most recent significant new category.\nTim Cook : I\u2019m thrilled with it, Tony, so I don\u2019t want you to read anything I\u2019m saying any way other than that. So I\u2019m not sure how to say that any clearer than that. And in any situation, whether it\u2019s the watch or in the past on iPad or on iPhone, when demand is much greater than supply, it\u2019s difficult to gauge exactly what it is. And so as you know, we don\u2019t make long term forecasts on here. We make forecasts for the current quarter. And so I don\u2019t want to make any comment about the consensus numbers. Honestly, I haven\u2019t even studied those. We\u2019ve got enough to think about here. I feel really great about it. The customer response, literally, from what I\u2019ve seen, is close to 100% positive. And so it\u2019s hard to imagine it being better.\nTony Sacconaghi : You talked about the watch having lower margins in the third quarter, which is surprising A) I think in the context of price points that many people thought were higher, B) in the context of what luxury watches sell for, C) I think in terms of what estimated margins might be installed on accessories like your watch band. So I\u2019m wondering if you believe that the watch\u2019s gross margins are being burdened by lower volumes and startup costs, and that you believe that as a category, watch margins will be, in total, including everything else that you sell with it, on a sustained basis, lower than the company average.\nTim Cook : Tony, we\u2019re not going to guide to or give projections of gross margin outside of the current quarter. And so what we have right now, which is a situation, it\u2019s not surprising to us, we knew we would be here, is that the watch gross margins for the current quarter that we\u2019ve included in the guidance that Luca\u2019s provided in the aggregate, are lower than the company average. And so that to us is intuitive that they would be. And so I think we must be just looking at it through a different lens than you are.\nTony Sacconaghi : I guess the question is is there anything unique about it being in its first quarter that it\u2019s providing that margin profile?\nTim Cook : In the first quarter with any new kind of product, you would always have learning and these sorts of things. We\u2019ve had this with every product we\u2019ve ever done. And so again, we\u2019re not guiding to what it will be over time. We\u2019re talking about what it is now. But you know, I would keep in mind that the functionality of the product that we\u2019re making is absolutely incredible, the power of it. And I haven\u2019t even seen this, but generally, there\u2019s cost breakdowns that come out around our products that are much different than the reality. I\u2019ve never seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate. And so if that\u2019s the basis for your comment, I\u2019d really dig on the data if I were you.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross : Tim, can you talk a bit about what you\u2019re seeing in China with 70% year over year growth in the Greater China revenue, and clearly very strong iPhone. If you can talk a bit about what consumers are saying, what the carriers are saying, in terms of demand and opportunity. Just any color, because clearly it\u2019s quite strong.\nTim Cook : Yeah, it was an incredible quarter. We were up 71% year over year. We set a record in China for revenues. We did that now in a quarter that included Chinese New Year, and so we have the help of a strong holiday season, much like the U.S. has a strong season in December. China\u2019s is obviously in the March quarter. iPhone led the way. It was up over 70% year on year. And the current estimates from Kantar are that that would mean that we would gain more than 9 points of share on a year over year basis. And so by everything I can see, we did extremely well. The Mac also had an unbelievable quarter in China, and I\u2019m particularly very happy with this, that Mac unit sales were up 31%. And like the rest of the world, or most of the rest of the world, IDC is projecting that PC sales in China contracted by 5% last quarter. And so once again bucking the tide. Also, in China, consistent with the company but at a much different rate, the App Store had a record quarter and grew over 100% year over year. And so you can see the iPhone, the Mac, and the App Store adding, and with the iPad in PRC, not in Greater China, but in the PRC, iPad had its best quarter ever, higher than all the others, and also grew in a market that contracted for the overall market. And so really and truly, it\u2019s sort of everything you look at in China was extremely good. We have been working significantly on expanding our ecosystem there, and so we added Union Pay as a payment option for customers. We increased the iPhone point of sales to over 40,000 during the quarter. That\u2019s up about 9% year on year. And more importantly than the total number, we are in many more cities than we were before. We worked significantly on our online store. Our online store revenue was up over three times year over year. As you probably heard us say before, we\u2019ve opened several stores in China recently. We\u2019re now at 21 in Greater China and we\u2019re on track still to achieve 40 stores by the middle of next year. The online store will also be expanding from around 319 cities to where they can hit two day delivery to 365 cities. So adding about 50 new cities by the end of this quarter. And so the net is we\u2019re investing a lot across the board in our infrastructure, in our products, on partnering with different companies. The Chinese developers are coming on in significant numbers. We\u2019ve now made payments to developers in Greater China of almost $5 billion over half of which was in the last 12 months. And so you can see this enormous momentum building in the developer community there as well. And so lots of positive things, and you know, as you probably heard me say before, I\u2019ve never seen as many people coming into the middle class as they are in China. And that\u2019s where the bulk of our sales are going. And so we\u2019re really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country.\nShannon Cross : And just sort of a follow up on the iPad side. What do you think it\u2019s going to take to reaccelerate iPads? The sellthrough was better than the sell in this quarter, but are we seeing cannibalization from the iPhone 6 plus and how are you sort of thinking about the IBM partnership as it relates to iPad?\nTim Cook : Number one, we have to stop having the situations where we sell through more than we sell in, where we don\u2019t have to have an inventory correction. That was over a million units. Two, have we had cannibalization? The answer is yes. We\u2019re clearly seeing cannibalization from iPhone and on the other side, from the Mac. And of course, as I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve never worried about that. It is what it is. That will play out, and at some point, it will stabilize. I\u2019m not sure precisely when, but I\u2019m pretty confident that it will. The IBM partnership, I think, is in its early stages in terms of bearing fruit here, but everything I see I like on it. I\u2019m a big believer in the ability for iPad to play in a major way in enterprise. And so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward. If you look at the underlying data, it makes you feel a lot better than the sales do. And so things like first time buyer rates, the latest numbers from the U.S. are somewhere around 40%. And if you look at China, they\u2019re almost 70%. And so these numbers are not numbers that you would get if the market were saturated. And so I continue to believe, even though I\u2019ve seen people write that, that I think that theory is not correct, and do not see that. We also see usage numbers that are off the charts, so far above competition it\u2019s not even in the same planet. And we see customer satisfaction at or near 100%. And so these kind of numbers, along with intent to buy numbers, everything looks fantastic, the ecommerce numbers. And so my belief is that as the inventory plays out, as we make some continued investments in our product pipeline, which we\u2019re doing, that we already have planned and have had planned for some time, between that, the inventory playing out, the enterprise starting to take over, I think still I believe the iPad is an extremely good business over the long term. When precisely it begins to grow again I wouldn\u2019t want to predict, but I strongly believe that it will.\nOperator: From UBS, we\u2019ll go to Steve Milunovich.\nSteve Milunovich: Luca, could you comment a bit about the factors that went into your decision on the capital return program, particularly the share repurchase part? For example, I would think you\u2019re pretty well done in terms of taking U.S. cash down. So you are dependent upon cash flow in the U.S. as well as debt. And regarding debt, do you have a debt to EBITDA ratio in mind that you don\u2019t want to go over? Do you want to keep your AA rating? Is that important? Just other factors like capital spending needs, just curious what your thinking was.\nLuca Maestri : The logic has not changed over the years. We look at our business plans, we look at what we want to accomplish from product perspective. We look at the capital needs that we have to run the business and to grow the business. And then we see that we\u2019re in this great position that we can return cash to shareholders. We know Apple very well. We are very excited by the level of customer response that we\u2019ve got for our current portfolio. We\u2019re super confident about the pipeline of products and services that we have, and therefore, we believe that there is great value in our stock. And that is the reason why, again this year, we\u2019re allocating the majority of the increase, which is the largest increase that we\u2019ve ever done, we\u2019re increasing the program by $70 billion. And the vast majority of that we\u2019re allocating to the share repurchase, because again, we believe there\u2019s great value in the stock. We also know, and understand, that we have several investors that value income. And so that\u2019s important for us to increase the dividend. And as we\u2019ve said in the past, we plan to continue to increase the dividend every year. And as we\u2019ve said in the past, we will come back at about this time next year and give you another update to the program, because we will have better information, and we\u2019ll be able to be very thoughtful about the size and the mix and the pace of the program. From a funding standpoint, of course we have a very strong balance sheet. We do have some cash in the U.S. We will continue to generate cash in the U.S., but definitely a good portion of the program will be funded through debt. We will raise debt both in the U.S. and outside of the United States. And you know, of course we\u2019ve got a very, very strong balance sheet. We\u2019ve got a very open dialog with the rating agencies. And so we feel we have a lot of room for us to fund the program. So from a balance sheet standpoint, we feel very, very comfortable with the program that we\u2019ve announced today.\nOperator: Next we\u2019ll go to Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.\nKulbinder Garcha: My first question is for Tim. Tim, on the point you made about the 20% of the [unintelligible] being on 6 or 6 plus, are we right in interpreting the comment that that\u2019s a substantially lower number than at this point in previous cycles? And that would, I guess, argue for just a longer period of growth as the [unintelligible] upgrades? And then also, linked to that, just by the points you\u2019re making on [unintelligible] iPhone users and [unintelligible] being higher, that number year on year, in the first six months, is really growing significantly year on year. Is that the right way to interpret that comment?\nTim Cook : I missed the second part of your question totally. Can you get a little closer to your phone?\nKulbinder Garcha : Oh, sorry, yes. My second part of my question is, in the first six months of the 6 plus, is the gross number of new users to Apple, whether it\u2019s new users or switches from Android, significantly growing year on year?\nTim Cook : I don\u2019t have the comparisons in front of me, about the answers to either one of your questions. My understanding of what you asked was is the 20% number that I\u2019d mentioned in the question from Gene, how does it compare year over year, is it a lot different? I don\u2019t know the answer to that off the top of my head. As I look at the number, my point from bringing it up is that there\u2019s a lot of people that haven\u2019t upgraded to a 6 and 6 plus. And so as I look at that, it screams that there\u2019s significant opportunity there. And that\u2019s before thinking about switchers and first time buyers.\nKulbinder Garcha : Okay great, and then Luca, just on the gross margin decline from the March quarter to June, I understand the currency point. I understand the iPhone\u2019s a little bit older. I guess of the iPhone and the watch impact, is the decline equally attributed to both those reasons, or is there something different going on?\nLuca Maestri : Let me tell you, there are a number of reasons why our guidance for gross margins is lower than the actual for the second quarter. The first one is the loss of leverage, because of the sequential decline in revenue. We got the foreign exchange, we got as you said, a lower iPhone mix. And we got the Apple Watch. I think we\u2019ll leave it at that, and we\u2019re not gonna get into more specifics. But those are the four reasons that drive the sequential decline.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.\nKeith Bachman: Tim, this is for you. You mentioned something in your past comment that you thought a lot of the iPhone sales were going into the middle class in China. And I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate on that and open it up more broadly speaking, to the emerging geographies. If you have demographics that you could talk about for your iPhone specifically, and where you think those phones are ending up. Because I think it does raise the question, as you look out over the next year or so, do you have the right price points for the demographic you\u2019re hitting?\nTim Cook : Here\u2019s what I would share with you, Keith, is that if you look in the emerging markets, our revenues were up 58% year on year. And this accounted for just slightly less than 40% of the company\u2019s revenue. If you look at BRIC within the emerging markets, BRIC countries were up 64% year over year. And so as I look at that, without having market research data on the demographics that you\u2019re asking, it\u2019s clear to me that it has to be coming from the middle class, because the upper income earners, there\u2019s only so many of those. And you can\u2019t grow those kind of numbers without getting significantly into the middle class. And so I think that\u2019s where we are. I hope we\u2019re also beyond the middle class, but I don\u2019t have the data to suggest that that\u2019s the case or not the case. But it\u2019s clear to me that the middle class statement has to be true.\nKeith Bachman : My follow up, Tim, I\u2019m gonna stay with you for a second, it sounds like HBO Now is a great opportunity today, and as you look out. If you could just speak more specifically, how we should be thinking about Apple as a conduit for something like HBO Now and other products. Is that a meaningful revenue opportunity without getting specific, and/or is it more about selling incremental devices, or is it about expanding the revenue pie as you look at opportunities like HBO Now?\nTim Cook : First of all, I think it\u2019s about giving the customer something they want and giving to them in Apples classic ease of use and in the product environments and the user interface that they\u2019re used to working in, in this case Apple TV. And so I think HBO in particular has some incredibly great content. And so we\u2019re marrying their great content, our great product and ecosystem, and it\u2019s clear from looking at the early returns - you know, we\u2019ve only been at this for a couple of weeks or so - that there\u2019s a lot of traction in there. And so where could it go? I don\u2019t want to speculate, but you can speculate probably as good as I can about where that can go. I think we\u2019re on the early stages of just major, major changes in media that are going to be really great for consumers, and I think Apple could be a part of that.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Keith.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri, and after that we\u2019ll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes and future products. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s Form 10-K for 2014 and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. And I\u2019d also just like to remind you that as we indicated in our last quarterly call, we\u2019re now including the results of our retail stores in the geographic segments where the stores are located and retail is no longer classified as an operating segment. We\u2019ve also updated our product summary reporting and we\u2019re now reflecting five categories of results; iPhone, iPad, Mac, Services and Other Products. We\u2019ve prepared schedules showing reclassifications of historical operating segment and product results for each of the last 12 quarters to conform to these new groupings and they are available now on our Web site at apple.com/investor. So I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we\u2019re reporting on a historic quarter and I'm incredibly proud of everyone who contributed to the amazing results you\u2019re about to hear. Interest in Apple products is at an all time high, with over 0.5 billion customer visits to our physical and online stores during the quarter. Demand for iPhone has been staggering, shattering our high expectations with sales of over 74 million units, driven by the unprecedented popularity of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. This volume is hard to comprehend. On average we sold over 34,000 iPhones every hour, 24 hours a day, everyday of the quarter. The execution by all of our teams to achieve these results was spectacular. By the end of the quarter, our new iPhones were available in 130 countries around the world, making this our fastest and most successful roll out ever. Additionally, the App Store and the Mac each set new records for quarterly revenues. Mac units were up 14% to 5.5 million, while the rest of the PC market continued to decline. App Store revenues was up a remarkable 41%. Demand was strong around the world. Flurry estimated that Apple products accounted for over half of all mobile device activations globally from December 19th to December 25th. It was truly a momentous quarter for iOS. On November 22nd we shipped our 1 billionth iOS device. It was a Space Gray 64 gigabyte iPhone 6 Plus, which we\u2019ve saved here at Apple. 1 billion devices is an almost unfathomable milestone, and we are all incredibly proud to be a part of it. Apple\u2019s mission is to make the greatest products on earth and enrich the lives of others. Through the success of iOS we have provided hundreds and millions of people with powerful personal technology that is simple and fun to use. Our customers are using Apple products to transform education, discover new ideas for business and express their creativity in ways that no one could have imagined when we sold the first iPhone less than eight years ago. It\u2019s amazing to watch and it reminds that people and great ideas are the reasons we make the things we make. Our strong overall performance in the December quarter resulted in total company revenue of $74.6 billion, and earnings of $18 billion. Both of these numbers are all-time records for us, with revenues up 30% and earnings up 38% over last year. And due to our very large capital return activities, earnings per share were up even more at 48% to $3.06, also an all-time quarterly record. Our results would have been even stronger, absent fierce foreign exchange volatility. We\u2019ve also made great progress on a number of very exciting new initiatives to further strengthen our ecosystem. We\u2019ve been blown away by the reaction to Swift, our new programing language. Inventing a new programing language is something very few companies can do, and we believe it will have a profound effect on our ecosystem. Swift became available in September as part of the Xcode tools and in the first month those tools were downloaded over 11 million times. A recent report from Redmonk showed that Swift has had unprecedented growth and is quickly climbing the list of the most popular programing languages. We\u2019ve seen many of our developers choosing Swift as they build significant new projects, and we are seeing fantastic work with Swift going on in education. Very recently, Stanford University released their Developing iOS 8 Apps with Swift course, which was posted to iTunes University making this amazing resource available to everyone in the world. There has also been incredible interest in HealthKit with over 600 developers now integrating it into their apps. Consumers can now choose to securely share their health and wellness metrics with these apps and this has led to some great, new and innovative experiences in fitness and wellness, food and nutrition and healthcare. For example, with apps such as an American Well, users can securely share data such as blood pressure, weight or activity directly with physicians, and leading hospitals such as Duke Medicine, Stanford Children and Penn Medicine are integrating data from HealthKit into their electronic medical record so that physicians can reach out to patients proactively when they see a problem that needs attention. With HealthKit and the iOS health app, we believe we\u2019re just at the beginning of amazing new health and wellness solutions for our customers. Our extensions of iOS in the home with HomeKit and in the car with CarPlay also continue to progress and this year we are looking forward to amazing HomeKit enabled products from several companies, and CarPlay enabled vehicles from over 30 automotive brands. Also as you know, we introduced two new categories in the fall and we\u2019re making great progress on both of them. Apple Pay is off to a very strong start and the feedback that we are getting from both individuals and institutions is extremely positive. Today about 750 banks and credit unions have signed on to bring Apple Pay to their customers, and in just three months after launch, Apple Pay makes up more than $2 out of $3 spent on purchases using contactless payment across the three major U.S. card networks. In merchants who already accept Apple Pay, the rates are even higher. Panera Bread tells us Apple Pay represents nearly 80% of their mobile payment transactions, and since the launch of Apple Pay, Whole Foods Market had seen mobile payments increased by more than 400%. You can use Apple Pay up and down Mainstreet, to pick up a prescription at Walgreens at Duane Reade, get office or school supplies at Office Depot and Staples and shop for groceries at national and regional stores from coast-to-coast, including BI-LO, Harvey\u2019s, Save Mart, Wegmans Food Markets, Whole Foods and Winn-Dixie among others. More merchants are excited to bring Apple Pay to their customers and adoption is strong. Just today USA Technologies announced they made Apple Pay available at about 200,000 places where everyday payments happen, including vending machines and businesses, airports and schools, commercial laundry machines and colleges, universities and laundromats and parking meters and payment kiosks in lots across the country. Point-of-sale suppliers tell us they are seeing unprecedented demand from merchants, and all of our partners and customers simply love this new service. With all of this momentum in the early days, we are more convinced than ever that 2015 will be the year of Apple Pay. Development for Apple Watch is right on schedule and we expect to begin shipping in April. Developers are hard at work on apps, notifications and information summaries that we call Glances, all designed specifically for the Watch's user interface. The creativity and software innovation going on around Apple Watch is incredibly exciting and we can\u2019t wait for our customers to experience them when Apple Watch becomes available. We\u2019re also making great progress in our partnership with IBM and our collaboration is winning over new customers. In December, we delivered the first 10 MobileFirst for iOS apps for banking, retail, insurance, financial services, telecommunications, governments and airlines, making iPhone and iPad even more productive for enterprises by providing [Apple] [ph] Cloud services with IBM's Big Data and analytics capabilities. Another 12 apps will be released this quarter, including three new industries, healthcare, energy and utilities, and industrial products. This will bring us to a total of 22 apps and we\u2019re on track to have over 100 by the end of 2015. In just over a month, more than a dozen enterprise customers have signed on as foundation clients to transform their companies with iPhone, iPad and IBM MobileFirst solutions including Miami Dade County, the seventh largest county in the United States by population, and American Eagle Outfitters, which operates more than 1,000 retail stores and ships to over 80 countries worldwide. And the list of new customers is expanding rapidly. IBM is engaged with more than 130 additional companies looking to empower their employees with MobileFirst for iOS solutions and the list keeps growing. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this partnership. In addition to all these initiatives, we have a robust product and services pipeline that we are very excited about, and we look forward to sharing more about them with you throughout the year. In addition to the contributions we make to humanity through our products, we made great progress on imported projects during the quarter including ConnectED and (PRODUCT)RED. With ConnectED we\u2019re focused on making a difference for students in communities who need it the most. We recently chose 114 schools across 29 states to receive an Apple ConnectED grant. Despite their economic challenges, all of these schools share a vision of what their students' lives would be like with Apple technology and we\u2019re proud to help them bring that to life. And in December, we undertook our largest ever initiative to help (PRODUCT)RED achieve the goal of an AIDS free generation. To commemorate World AIDS Day, we worked with some of our developer partners to create and donate the proceeds from 25 special apps and we also contributed a portion of sales at our retail and online stores on two of the year\u2019s busiest shopping days. As a result, Apple\u2019s donation set a new record. Delivering the results we\u2019re reporting today reflects months and years of focus and determination from teams across Apple as well as our amazing developers and business partners. I\u2019d like to thank all of them for their commitment and performance and I\u2019d also like to thank our incredible customers for their ongoing loyalty and enthusiasm. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Luca to discuss our December quarter results in more detail.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. In the December quarter we generated all time record revenue of $74.6 billion, an increase of $17 billion, or 30% year-over-year. We achieved this exceptional performance despite significant foreign exchange headwinds from many currencies. Our growth was broad based across the world, with revenue from developed countries up 20% and revenue from emerging countries up 58%. The performance of our Greater China segment was particularly impressive, with revenue up 70%. Sales were well ahead of our expectations in a number of areas. The unprecedented demand for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus combined with our tremendously successful production ramp allowed us to build and ship several million more iPhones than we had expected when we provided guidance back in October. And also Mac revenue and services revenue reached all-time highs. Gross margin was 39.9% above our guidance range and operating margin was $24.2 billion, representing 32.5% of revenue, and our highest operating margin percentage in 10 quarters. Net income was $18 billion, surpassing our previous all-time record by almost $5 billion. This translated to diluted earnings per share of $3.06, a 48% year-over-year increase. Cash flow from operations was exceptional at $33.7 billion, also a new all-time record. For details by product I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.5 million iPhones, an increase of 23.4 million over last year, representing 46% growth. iPhone sales grew strongly in both developed and emerging markets. Among many great results around the world, unit sales were up 44% in the U.S. and up 97% in the BRIC countries. Sales doubled year-over-year in China, our second largest iPhone market, as well as in Brazil and in Singapore. Thanks to the popularity of iPhone 6 Plus, and the increased value customers saw in our higher storage capacity offerings, iPhone ASPs were $687, an increase of $50 over the year ago quarter. This led to iPhone revenue growth of 57% year-over-year, with quarterly sales exceeding $50 billion for the first time ever. We had a 200,000 unit decline in iPhone channel inventory during December quarter this year, compared to an increase of about 1 million iPhones during the year ago period, and we were not able to reach supply demand balance until this month. This left us below our target range of five to seven weeks of channel inventory on a look forward basis. We\u2019re now working with about 375 carriers, representing 72% of the world\u2019s mobile phone subscriber base, and we have over 210,000 points of sale for iPhone across the globe. Our customers love their iPhones. A December ChangeWave survey measured a 97% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone. A study published by Chitika Insights last month indicated that iPhone accounts for 53% of North America smartphone web traffic, almost twice the level of the next closest brand. And in the corporate market ChangeWave found that among IT buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter this year, 77% intend to purchase iPhones. Next I\u2019d like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.5 million Macs, an increase of almost 700,000 units over last year, a 14% growth rate. Thanks for the popularity of our stunning new iMac with Retina 5K display, Mac ASPs increased by $58 sequentially, driving all time record revenue for Mac of 6.9 billion. We achieved double-digit year-over-year unit growth in both desktops and portables. These results are truly remarkable, given the contraction in the global PC market which IDC estimates declined by 3% in the quarter. We have now gained market share for 34 of the last 35 quarters. We ended the quarter with Mac channel inventory slightly below our four to five week target range. Turning to iPad, we sold 21.4 million units compared to 26 million in the December quarter last year. Given the introduction of new iPads in October, we increased iPad channel inventory by 1.1 million units during the quarter, compared to an increase of about 2.1 million in the December quarter last year. This left us within our five to seven week target range of channel inventory on a look forward basis. Customer experience and usage data for iPad continue to be excellent. In our November survey, ChangeWave measured a 98% customer satisfaction rate for iPad Air, and also found that among people to finding a purchase a tabled within 90 days, 60% plan to purchase an iPad. And among businesses planning to purchase tablets, the intent was even stronger at 78%. Chitika Insights' most recent report indicated that iPad users in North America generate over 70% of tablet based web traffic, more than six times the web traffic of the next closest competitor and Custora\u2019s latest e-commerce report indicates that iPad accounts for 82% of all U.S. e-commerce transactions from tablets. All these results are consistent with usage data from the holiday shopping season. IBM\u2019s digital analytics benchmark service found that iOS devices accounted for more than twice the online traffic and almost four times the e-commerce sales on Android devices during November and December. The Apple ecosystem continues to thrive. Combining all of our services, revenue grew to 4.8 billion in the December quarter, a new all-time high and an increase of 9% year-over-year. This record performance was driven primarily by the tremendous momentum of the App Store, with revenue growing 41% in the December quarter. Our iOS developers have earned over $25 billion from the App Store to date, and we\u2019re thrilled with their success. Total sales of media and software from iTunes were $2.6 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in the year ago quarter. Our direct China performance was also outstanding. We welcomed more visitors than ever before and generated record revenue in both our physical and online stores. We opened 10 new retail stores during the quarter, bringing us to a total of 447, 182 of which are outside the United States. We\u2019ve opened two new stores this month in Greater China and we\u2019re on track towards 40 stores in Greater China by mid-2016. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $178 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $22.7 billion. We completed our first international debt offering, issuing 2.8 billion euro denominated notes at very attractive interest rates and greatly diversifying our debt investor base. We spent 5 billion to repurchase 45 million Apple shares through open market transactions, paid 2.8 billion in dividends and equivalents, and utilized over 500 million to net share settle vesting employee RSUs. We also retired an additional 8 million shares in connection with our accelerated share repurchase programs. We have now taken action on almost $103 billion of our $130 billion capital return program, including $73 billion in share repurchases, with four quarters remaining to its completion. In the last 12 months alone, we have returned over $57 billion to our investors. We review our capital return program on an ongoing basis. We continue to solicit feedback from a broad base of investors and we're on track to announce an update to the program in April when we report our second quarter results. Now as we move ahead into the March quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52 billion and $55 billion, compared to $45.6 billion in the year ago quarter, and this represents a very significant revenue increase, despite growing foreign exchange headwinds from the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most currencies. We expect gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%, we expect OpEx to be between $5.4 billion and $5.5 billion and we expect OI&E to be about $350 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.3%. Also today our Board has declared dividend of $0.47 per common share payable on February 12, 2015 to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2015. With that let's open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: And we ask that you limit yourself to one part question and one follow-up. Operator may we have the first question please. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First we\u2019ll hear from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross : Thank you very much and nice iPhone numbers. Can you talk about Luca about currency? How you are thinking about it? What it did this quarter? What it does to gross margin? And what\u2019s it\u2019s going to do during the year? Because that\u2019s clearly a big topic of conversation?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Shannon I\u2019ll do that now. I\u2019ll talk about Q1. I\u2019ll talk about what we are looking for Q2 and possibly even further. Obviously, what we\u2019ve seen during Q1 has been unprecedented movements in currencies. I would say during the course of the quarter the biggest impact came from the Japanese yen, the Russian rubel, but also from euro, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar. Our revenue growth during Q1 would have been four percentage points higher on a constant currency basis. On a profitability standpoint, our hedging program partially mitigated the impact from the volatility in currencies. As we look forward, and we look into particularly the March quarter, the foreign exchange headwinds will be stronger in Q2 than they were in Q1 for two main reasons. The first one is the fact that the U.S. dollar has continued to appreciate against foreign currencies during the last few weeks. And the other one is the fact that our existing hedges expire. They get replace by new contracts at current levels and therefore the protection that is provided to us by our hedging program diminishes over time. What that means to us going forward for the March quarter is that revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in constant currency would be five point higher than what we are guiding to, if it wasn\u2019t for the FX movements. In terms of gross margins, and you know that we look our gross margins on a sequential basis, the gross margin percentage after the offset that we're getting from the hedging program will be impacted by over 100 basis points. Now having said that, we have factored the impact that I just described into the guidance that we provided to you. So that\u2019s where we are right now. Of course, as you look further out, you know we do not provide guidance past the March quarter, but it goes without saying that at current levels, again those headwinds will continue to become stronger for the reason I explained earlier, that our hedges continue to expire, they get replaced by new hedging contracts at current levels and so -- and there is the impact that we would see during the course of the year. It goes without saying strong U.S. dollar has negative impact on our international business. Having said all that, we have provided what we believe is very strong guidance for the March quarter. We remain very, very confident about the portfolio of products and services that we have in the market today and we remain very, very confident in the pipeline of products and services that we have.\nShannon Cross : And as a follow-up to that, can you talk a little bit about pricing power? Basically as you think about currency and euro movements and that -- and then the contracts you have with the carriers, can you talk about maybe the opportunities to raise prices, because I know it's something that a lot of companies are balancing right now?\nLuca Maestri: I think as you know, we prefer to adjust local pricing at the time of new product launches. That will be obviously our preference. That\u2019s what we do in normal times. When currencies move as much as they have been in places like Russia for example, sometimes we need to take mid-cycle action to realign pricing. So we\u2019ll see what happens. As you know currency markets tend to be very volatile. So we just want to understand a bit better what is happening.\nOperator: From UBS we\u2019ll hear from Steve Milunovich.\nSteve Milunovich: I wonder if you could address the mix of the iPhone 6 line. Specifically, how did the 6 Plus do? I don\u2019t know if you can give us a sense relative to total units, maybe geographic view, and also availability? Are you calling up on the 6 Plus?\nTim Cook: Steve, its Tim. We don\u2019t report out the precise mix. But what I can tell you is that iPhone 6 was the most popular iPhone last quarter, but I just believe to sell 74.5 million they were really all popular. And all did well. There is clearly a geographic difference where some geos would skew much higher on their preference to iPhone 6 Plus than other geos. And so it\u2019s something that is not consistent around the world. But both did incredibly well, and we\u2019re really proud of them, along with the iPhone 5S and 5C as well, which continues to in the lineup.\nSteve Milunovich: Okay. And then could you update us in terms of the sell through relative to the reported numbers for the Phone, the Pad and your biggest plans to increase by roughly a week of channel inventory?\nTim Cook: From an iPhone point of view, as I think Luca covered, our channel inventory decreased from the beginning of the quarter by 200,000 units, and that left us outside of our target range on the low -- outside the low end of the range to be specific. Just recently we became in supply demand balance on the 6 and 6 Plus in January. We were not able to reach a balanced state during our fiscal Q1. On iPad, we increased channel inventory by 1.1 million units from beginning of the quarter to end of the quarter. That compares to the previous year where we're increased to 2.1 million. Obviously, that inventory was required because of all the new products that we announced on iPad with the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 in the October timeframe during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we were within the target range of channel inventory on iPad. In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where we\u2019re outside of it, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a large step function increase. We would expect it to occur more gradually over time than sort of all at once type of thing. But we don\u2019t guide to channel inventory specifically as you know.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Morgan Stanley we\u2019ll go to Katy Huberty.\nKaty Huberty: So not to dilute the fantastic performance in December, but can you talk a little bit about how you think about the sustainability of this very strong iPhone demand into 2015, particularly given that most carriers had access to that product during the quarter? And then I have a follow up on margin?\nTim Cook: Sure Katy. It\u2019s Tim. You can see from the March guidance that we\u2019ve given, that we are incredibly bullish about iPhone going forward. We believe that it\u2019s the best smartphone in the world. Our customers are telling us that. The market is telling us that. We\u2019re doing well in virtually every corner of the world. And so we\u2019re very bullish that it does have legs. I would point out that only a small fraction of the installed base has upgraded. And so there is a lot more people within the installed base. But I would also point out that we had the highest number of customers new to iPhone last quarter than in any prior launch. And also that the current iPhone line up experienced the highest Android switcher rate in any of the last three launches in the three previous years. And we didn\u2019t look back to the other years. So I don\u2019t know about those. And so we see that we\u2019re appealing to new customers, both new to smartphone and new to iPhone and people switching. We\u2019re very bullish on the product and getting great feedback about the quality of the products we\u2019re shipping. And so we\u2019re very, very bullish. The emerging markets which has been a source to great questions over time, the growth was absolutely stunning, in Brazil and Mainland China more than doubling year-over-year which is 3x to 4x what those markets were doing according to IDC. And so we enter the quarter with quite a bit of momentum.\nKaty Huberty: And Luca as you know, you typically enjoy component cost downs and yield improvements as you move through a product cycle. Is there anything other than currency that keeps you from potentially locking the gross margins higher over the course of the year? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Katy, you\u2019re right. I mean on both fronts. We certainly expect more favorable cost in the March quarter than we\u2019ve seen in the December quarter. It goes with our product cycle. The foreign exchange headwinds as I was explaining to Shannon, they will be on a sequential basis a headwind of more than 100 basis points. So if you were to exclude that foreign exchange impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in margins. The other element that is there and it\u2019s very seasonal, it\u2019s always there, it\u2019s the loss of leverage that we got from Q1 to Q2. When you look at our revenue guidance, we are guiding to a sequential decline between 26% and 30%. So you obviously have that loss of leverage, but without a doubt the biggest headwind that we got right now is foreign exchange. Having said all that guiding 38.5% to 39.5%, we feel slightly very good about where we are right now in the cycle.\nNancy Paxton: Katie could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Benjamin Reitzes, Barclays.\nBenjamin Reitzes: And Tim obviously a lot of good questions about the great iPhone number but I wanted to ask about the Apple Watch. Shifting in April, month or two later than I think you said originally obviously, probably not that big a deal, but what\u2019s going on with that product in a little more detail in terms of the timing and your excitement for it and maybe a little more color on other apps that could be available at launch? And any expectations you have for it would be great.\nTim Cook: My expectations are very high on it. I'm using it every day and love it and I can\u2019t live without it. So I see that we\u2019re making great progress on the development of it. The number of developers that are writing apps more for it are impressive and we\u2019re seeing some incredible innovation coming out there. And just to clarify, what we had been saying was early 2015, and we sort of look at the year and think of early as the first four months, mid is the next four months and late is the final four months. And so to us it's sort of within the range and it\u2019s basically when we thought. We\u2019re going to -- but most importantly we\u2019re going to be thrilled to start shipping it, because we got a lot of customers that are wanting to get one.\nBenjamin Reitzes: And then just a follow-up in terms of China. How do you feel the momentum there is in terms of sustainability versus some of the local competition, and as you navigate that market specifically going forward?\nTim Cook: The local competition was obviously there this quarter and has been there for many quarters before. And so the local competition is not new. I think we did really well there. I'm very proud of how we\u2019re doing. I was there right after the launch in October. And the excitement around the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus were absolutely phenomenal. And you can see that in the results with Mainland China being up 100% year-on-year, despite not having a full quarter of sales since we launched in the second half of October. You can tell by that we\u2019re a big believer in China. We\u2019re looking at our investment. We\u2019re growing the number of stores. We\u2019ll hit 20 soon and we\u2019re doubling that by mid-2016 as Angela has said earlier and Luca said in his prepared comments as well. We\u2019re also growing the channel there. Our online store has expanded to over 350 cities now, and in fact our online revenues in China last quarter were more than the sum of the previous five years. And so it\u2019s an incredible market. I think people love Apple products and we are going to do our best to serve the market.\nNancy Paxton: Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Bernstein we\u2019ll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.\nToni Sacconaghi: I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue guidance. Luca you mentioned the range as down 26% to 30% sequentially. I think if you look back over the last three or four Q1 to Q2s, revenues declined more in the 15% to 20% range. As you noted, your iPhone channel inventory is below your target range as well. So if anything, that might be going up. So I'm wondering if you could just discuss a little bit what factors are contributing to this steeper than normal decline this quarter, particularly given your ongoing enthusiasm for the phone.\nLuca Maestri: First of all, it\u2019s a 20% year-over-year growth that we\u2019re guiding at the top end of the range. So we obviously feel good about a 20% growth. As we look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think is important to point out. I mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds. They are there. We need to deal with them, but they obviously are a negative to revenue. Those are headwinds that we had this year and were not there a year ago. So that\u2019s one factor. We\u2019ve also said the manufacturing ramp that we\u2019ve had this year in the December quarter has been the fastest that we\u2019ve ever had. And so that\u2019s also a factor that impacts the sequential compare. And then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter which are not going to repeat this year. One of them is the fact that last year in January we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent channel sale for China Mobile. That of course is not going to repeat this year. And we also had a very, very strong quarter in Japan in the March quarter a year ago, which was driven by very significant carrier promotional activities, and a pull forward of sales into the March quarter in anticipation of a consumption tax increase that took place on April 1, and again that is not going to repeat. So when you take those factors into account, I think that explains the sequential decline that we see this year. Again I want to point out to the 20% year-over-year growth.\nToni Sacconaghi: Luca just to confirm, sequentially my math is saying it's about two point incremental revenue headwind. Is that the right way to think about it?\nLuca Maestri: From FX?\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Currency.\nLuca Maestri: Right.\nToni Sacconaghi: Sequentially, okay. Tim, I was wondering if I could have my -- direct my follow-up to you, which is the iPad. You\u2019ve spoken on prior calls about your enthusiasm for the product on a go forward basis. Over the last year it's down double-digits from a unit perspective and ASP has also been declining. So I was wondering if you could comment on whether your bullishness about the iPad persists and is it really -- do you believe it's a replacement cycle, that we will ultimately see that will start to drive growth or is there really innovation in product that is both necessary and forthcoming that\u2019s going to drive that growth?\nTim Cook: Toni, I am still very optimistic and bullish on iPad over the long run, as I\u2019ve indicated before. When you measure it in these 90-day clips, as we do in the short run, I don\u2019t think you're going to see a miraculous change in the -- or an improvement in the year-over-year. But here is what I see when I look at it and the reason that I'm so optimistic. I see that the first time buyer rates are very high. And so by very high, I mean that if you look in some of the developed market like the U.S., Japan, the UK, you would find that 50% of the people are buying an iPad for the first time. If you look in China, it's over 70%. And so that -- when you have that kind of first time buyer rates, you don\u2019t have a saturated market. When I look at the customer stat on iPad, it's literally off the charts, in some cases a 100%, which is unheard of in surveys to get these kind of customer stat ratings. When I look at the usage, the usage is six times our nearest competitor. The usage is defined as measured in web browsing is like 71% of total tablets, as I think Luca covered earlier. Also the commerce taking place across the iPad is enormous. Essentially over 80% of the commerce on tablets are taking place on iPad. And so when I back up and look at all of these, and I believe that over the long arc of time that the iPad is the great business, I also have visibility obviously of what\u2019s in the pipeline and feel very, very good about that. That said, I'm not projecting -- to be clear with everyone, I'm not projecting something very different next quarter or the next. I'm thinking over the long run. In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true, that the upgrade cycle is longer. It's longer than an iPhone, probably between an iPhone and a PC. We haven\u2019t been in the business long enough to say that with certainty, but that\u2019s what we think. There is probably some level of cannibalization that's going on with the Mac on one side and the Phone on the other. And so you probably have a little bit of that that is shaking out. How much, very hard to tell on the early going, particularly since we just shipped the new phones a few months ago. And so I think there's some things like that are going on. On the other side I think the partnership with IBM and the work that we have going on in the Enterprise is profound. I think we\u2019re really going to change the way people work. I'm really excited about the apps that are coming out and how fast the partnership is getting up and running. And so I think that can move the dial there. And so I'm not predicting the 90-day clips and so forth, but over long arc of time I really believe that iPad is a great space, a great product and with -- also coupled with the product innovation we\u2019ve got, I think there is a very, very bright future for it.\nOperator: We'll go to Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster : A couple of questions for Tim. First, any updates on Apple TV or your broader biz in the living room? And second a high level question about Apple Pay and some of the successes at point-of-sales. Can you talk a little bit about if in app is important or how important that is? And potentially how the product could evolve over time? Could you see this becoming more consumer to consumer or more just kind of a broader payment platform? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Gene, on Apple TV, we had a solid quarter with existing product. We\u2019ve sold 25 million Apple TVs now which at the sake of repeating myself, it\u2019s something that we continue to look at and work on and find a way that we can make even greater contribution than what we\u2019re doing. On Apple Pay, both the contactless payment and the in app are both important. I think they are both huge opportunities. I think they\u2019ll play out differently in different geographic regions as to which one is larger than the other and well likely -- the mix of those things will change over time as more and more commerce flows across apps and so forth. In terms of how it evolves, I think we're in the first inning on it. I'm not -- we haven\u2019t even completed the first inning yet. There's tons of things on our roadmap of adding functionality to it. We\u2019re obviously -- we're just in the U.S. right now and so there's tons of countries to go to and there is not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t get notes from many businesses outside U.S. running Apple Pay and banks and merchants. And of course we still have a lot of merchants left in the U.S. But I have to tell you that given that we\u2019ve launched in October, I'm actually unbelievably shocked, positively shocked at how many merchants were able to implement Apple Pay in the heart of their holiday season, because generally most people sort of lock down and don\u2019t do very much. But we were able to get this in a lot of different merchants and I give them a lot of credit for that. But I think we\u2019re just on the front end. And I think that this is the year of Apple Pay. And some of the things you mentioned and others are all things that we\u2019re looking at and in many cases working on in terms of where it can take us.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Gene. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From JPMorgan we\u2019ll go to Rod Hall.\nRod Hall: So I wanted to start off Tim. You talked about the smaller of the user base who have upgraded to iPhone 6 or 6 Plus. And I wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on that, maybe even go as far as quantifying how many of the base you think have upgraded and also talk a little bit about the pattern of upgrades? Are they all tending to be over iPhones or is there are good spread? Can you give us any further color on that? Thanks.\nTim Cook: It\u2019s a small fraction. It\u2019s a number that's in the mid-teens or barely in the teens. And so when I look at that I say that there is an enormous amount left. And given there are fair amount of Android units out there, there is also an enormous amount of Android customers that could switch. And I\u2019d also remind you that there is a lot of people that have not yet bought a smartphone. And I know it doesn\u2019t feel like that when you\u2019re sitting in the United States, but from a worldwide point of view there's still lots of them. And so I see all three of those groups there and I'm very excited about all of them, and serving all of them.\nRod Hall: And then my follow up I\u2019d like to direct at Luca. Luca, I wonder, could you talk a little bit about the duration of the hedge contracts and the renewal pattern that we should expect to see this year? Just kind of remind us what your typical renewal pattern is and will you be accelerating that this year given all the currency movement?\nLuca Maestri: Yes Rod. Typically, I think, we have clearly active hedging programs of winning the market almost every day, but we tend to hedge three to 12 months out. There are cases where maybe we\u2019ve had to go a bit longer, if we feel that we have a strong conviction about certain currencies. Otherwise again the typical period is three to 12 months. And as hedges roll off, we replace them with new hedges. We take into account the exposures that we have around the world, taking into account our most recent forecast and we hedge accordingly. We feel very good about our hedging position and the decisions that we\u2019ve made particularly during the summer when we felt that maybe we needed to hedge a bit more than we have done historically.\nTim Cook: It\u2019s probably worth pointing out too that there is some markets where we can\u2019t economically hedge.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. There are some exposures where the cost of hedging is prohibitive or the financial instruments are not there to hedge. And in those cases of course that\u2019s where you get the full impact of the volatility.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Rod. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From RBC Capital Markets we\u2019ll go to Amit Daryanani.\nAmit Daryanani: I just have two questions. One maybe just on the gross margin side. I want to understand, the 100 basis points of headwind that you're talking about in the March quarter, is that sort of is -- there is some still protection on the hedges or is that a raw number with no hedges in place?\nLuca Maestri: That\u2019s correct. I think its good clarification. I was talking about the net impact after the hedges. The impact without hedges would be higher. And again this is sequentially right. Because on a year-over-year basis actually the impact is larger, given the fact that currencies have moved during the last 12 months. But the 100 basis points that I quoted includes the mitigating impact of the hedging program.\nAmit Daryanani: And just, when you think about the iPad and you talked about the IBM partnership where you're seeing some traction. Could you just talk about what sort of penetration do you guys think iPads have on an enterprise side right now and how do you see that improve over the next few quarters as you roll out the MobileFirst modules with IBM.\nTim Cook: We think that what we know, that if you look at the Fortune 500 as an example, we\u2019re in essentially all of the Fortune 500 companies. So the issue is not that, and it\u2019s not a market share number, because our market share is extremely high. The issue is that enterprises, generally speaking are only deploying iPads to a small percentage of their workforce. And so the real opportunity is to bring mobility into the enterprises and change how people work. In order to do that, you obviously need apps that are written to specific jobs, not just apps that are general productivity apps like work processors and spreadsheets and presentation tools et cetera. And so that\u2019s one of the things that working with IBM provides us, is both that and the knowledge of the verticals, which they bring a significant amount of knowledge on all of the verticals that I mentioned earlier. And so where can we take that to? I think if we can really change the way people work, I think the opportunity is enormous. We\u2019re not hanging numbers out there to be measured on at this point, but we don\u2019t do a lot of big partnerships as you probably know. And so when we do one, it is significant and it\u2019s because we really believe in it, and we really believe in this one and what it can do for customers.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you Amit. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Deutsche Bank we\u2019ll hear from Sherri Scribner.\nSherri Scribner: Luca, I was hoping you can give us some detail on your expectations for operating expenses going forward. I know you\u2019ve been investing pretty significantly in new products, but wanted to see how we should think about those trending over the next couple of quarters?\nLuca Maestri: Sherry, as you know, we provide guidance just for the upcoming quarter. And from what you\u2019ve seen from our guidance for the March quarter, we\u2019re guiding to a growth in OpEx on a year-over-year basis that is similar to what we\u2019ve experienced during the course of the December quarter. We obviously feel good about the business during the December quarter. Our revenue exceeded in terms of growth, our growth in operating expenses. There's going to be quarters where the opposite is going to happen. Our expense to revenue ratio during the December quarter was that 7.4%. It was the lowest that we\u2019ve had in two years. It\u2019s among the lowest ratios that we\u2019ve ever had. But obviously we are investing in the business and we will never under invest in the business. The majority of the increase will continue to come from R&D, given the fact that we\u2019ve expanded our product portfolio and we\u2019re making investments all the time ahead of the revenue that would be generated in the future. We also expect to continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We\u2019re expanding distribution all over the world. We\u2019ve taken our brand to more places and we continue to open new retail stores around the world. And so the idea for us is to continue to invest in the business, making the right trade-offs and the results from the December quarter give us very good confidence for the future.\nNancy Paxton: Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll go to Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.\nBill Shope: I wanted to follow up on your previous comments on the iPhone and the customer composition for the quarter. Considering the iPhone 6 Plus brought you into entirely new segment of smartphone market, can you give us a bit more color on that customer composition for this device? Specifically you mentioned the differences in geographic adoption, but how about on the Android switcher comments you made earlier, and first time adopters relative to the traditional iPhone 6 and your other iPhone models in the past. And I guess related to that, what do you think this tells you about your ASP and unit opportunity for growth in 2015?\nTim Cook: Bill, at this point, just shortly after the quarter, we don\u2019t have all of our research in from all of the people that bought last quarter. But in the aggregate, as I've mentioned before, we saw more new customers to iPhone than we had ever seen before. And we had a higher rate of Android switchers than we had in the three previous launches. And it\u2019s not that we had more in the fourth one, and I don\u2019t what those numbers are, and whether it's something we're looking at. And so between the switchers and the people that are just new to smartphones and selected an iPhone, and our upgrades, which we\u2019re very happy with, but represent a small fraction of our installed base, we feel really great about what\u2019s in front of us.\nBill Shope: Makes sense. And then a follow up on your Apple Pay commentary. When we look at the opportunity outside of the U.S. are there unique hurdles we should consider as we think about the timing of the rollouts in Europe and Asia, or is it really just about following partnerships together?\nTim Cook: Each has a different implementation. And so in some ways, like there is a different set of carriers in every country, there is a different set of banks. In a lot of the countries, some of the processes with the merchants are different. And so it\u2019s an area where there is quite a bit of difference country to country to country and so there's clearly heavy lifting involved to scale. However it\u2019s not something that scares us or that\u2019s preventing us from viewing it as a big opportunity.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Bill.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015, the forms 10-Q for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week, we're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations. Our results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range. We sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters, as we forecasted in January. iPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal customers in the world, and fiscal 2016 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before. This is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other company can match. We had a record-setting quarter for Services, with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion. App Store revenue continued to skyrocket, while Music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Music. In fact, J.D. Power recently announced that Apple Music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market. Earlier this month I visited Japan, where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments where they commute, dine and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong growth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next few months. Apple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year-on-year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of September than we did across all of fiscal 2015. And with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners tell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet. We remain very confident about the future of our Services business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our Services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance in battery life ever, thanks to the custom-designed Apple A10 Fusion chip. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and come in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly as possible. We're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smartwatch, packed with new features including built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display and a powerful dual-core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are recognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated and connected. One recent example is Aetna, which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch for individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to encourage them to live a healthier day. We've just rolled out new versions of iOS, macOS and watchOS and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac, enhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call memories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink and handwritten notes. We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all new App Store for Messages, and there has been a marked increase in our monthly active users. One of the great new features of iOS 10 is the Home app, which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can easily set up and securely control all their HomeKit accessories, from lights and cameras to the garage doors and air conditioners, all from their favorite iOS devices. We expect over 100 HomeKit-compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple to help ensure customer security when using them. Our Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems, machine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for years to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily both through R&D and acquisitions. Today, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10, which offers suggestions on which app you might want to use or which context you might want to include in an email. Our camera and photo software uses advanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find. Machine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning continually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening it to developers and most recently by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra. We're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs and we're very happy with the engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a a first of its kind all-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country. They're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their network. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity. We're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership with Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS platform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions across the enterprise. We're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20 industries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on another incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our amazing developer community for their relentless creativity and our wonderful customers, business partners and shareholders for their loyalty and support. Now I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strongly in many emerging markets, including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand and Vietnam, and we continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America. Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue and net income was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion, which is a new record for the September quarter. For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five to seven week target range of channel inventory. We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. iPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to iPhone 7 and 7 Plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than our September quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago. Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 Plus, and we're working very hard to get the new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible. iPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter, which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we launched iPhone SE and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a level similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the U.S. for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found that among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting a 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measured a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating and found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% planned to purchase iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App Store growth rate has now accelerated for five consecutive quarters, reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App Store remains the preferred destination for both customers and developers. According to App Annie, it generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance from apps, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically, as Tim mentioned. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac installed base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future Mac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with increase driven by the new iPad Pro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five to seven-week target range. We continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above $200. And in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter. In the enterprise market, we are seeing some great examples of iPad and Mac deployment. Our Mobility Partner Program continues to grow stronger, with over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution partner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad based POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations worldwide, including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available. IBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more than 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs have three times the cost to manage, drive twice the number of support calls and are 5 times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs. Thanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing the total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a full-year lifecycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion. $216 billion of this cash or 91% of the total was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open market transactions, and we launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated share repurchase program, with adding an additional 12.3 million shares. So total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%. We have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the September quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8 billion. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a differential graphic mix of earnings relative to our regional expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6% As we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the all-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. May we have the first question, please?\nOperator: First we'll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nEugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, good afternoon and congratulations. And Tim, now that we're a month in the iPhone 7, are you seeing anything measurable in terms of the growing trend of annual upgrades? And second is, historically in terms of new product categories, you guys have always looked for unique advantage before getting into a segment. And I'm curious about the car. There are a lot of rumors out there, and would like your perspective on how you think about an advantage that Apple could add in the auto space?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: In terms of iPhone 7, Gene, the carriers that had upgrade plans, the information that we have from them is that demand is very robust. But from a worldwide point of view, the truth is that demand is outstripping supply in the vast majority of places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. And so it's sort of we are in a situation at the moment, it's difficult in the early weeks to be able to differentiate. But on an anecdotal basis, it's clear the upgrade programs are a win. I can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products. And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience. And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to, certainly nothing to announce today.\nEugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Just one quick follow up in terms of the supply. Do you think we'll be at equilibrium by the end of the quarter for iPhone supplies?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: It's hard to say. I believe that on iPhone 7 we will. On iPhone 7 Plus, I'm not sure. I wouldn't say yes at this point, because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch.\nEugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, can you help us understand what's embedded in revenue guidance for the extra week as well as any rebuilding of channel inventory given all the major products are running below target? Just trying to get at whether you see revenue and in particular iPhone growth year on year on more of a sellout basis when you adjust for those two factors? And then I have a follow up.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes Katy, sure. Let me say a few things on the 14th week and revenue up for the December quarter. Keep in mind that December quarter a year ago for us was an all-time quarterly revenue record. We think we can grow this year. As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. The strength of our Services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September. We think we can continue to grow very well into the December quarter. You mentioned the 14th week, and the few extra days do help us this quarter. But I think it's important to keep in mind that there are other factors that go and offset these extra few days. As you know, the launch timing of the new iPhone is different this year. We had the first 90 days of sales this year hit Q4. There were only two days last year, so the cadence has moved more towards the Q4 this year versus Q1 last year. As you know, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the first quarter of 2016. As Tim said, we are very supply constrained on iPhone 7 Plus this year. We're simply more supply constrained this year than we were a year ago. And then keep in mind that there were a couple of things that affect the compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago, we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year. And also the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter. So I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great color. Thank you for that. A follow up for Tim. What should we read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past three years while sales growth was sort of a fifth of that? Are R&D investments just less efficient than they were in the company's history, or should we think about that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market, and so that's a part of it. And we feel really great about the things that we've got. We've also put a lot of emphasis on our Services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. And so we're very much, we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the R&D spend increasing.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much. A couple of questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit more about China, just how you're thinking about it, where you're seeing pressure? I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant rebound during the first quarter, but what are your customers telling you about the demand in China?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question, Shannon. So to sort of back up from our results for the quarter, the 90-day clock, and look at the full year of 2016, we were down 17% compared to the fiscal year 2015 which was up 84% from the previous year. So if you look at 2014 to 2016, the revenue grew 52% and the CAGR was 23%, which is really a pretty good result. Also as you probably know, the fiscal year 2016 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%, so the underlying business performance was 14% down. And so, why was it down? There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. And so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 2016 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S as a point, it had further to fall. And so that's the main reason in our view that you see a difference. Now that spun or created another issue for us, because we didn't forecast that accurately. So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it. And so those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue. Now looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive. It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us. And from a longer-term point of view, out of the 90-day clocks and so forth, we are very bullish on China. We continue to see a middle class that is booming there. There might be some sort of a new normal in the economy, but a new normal there is still a good growth rate. And so with the number of middle class \u2013 people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue to have a really good opportunity there, and so we continue to focus significantly in China.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Great. Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: And then can you talk a bit about acquisitions? And I don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done sort of at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world. And especially if you find a way to have repatriation of some of the cash at a low tax rate possibly with the next administration. So I just, if you can give sort of an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But we're definitely open and we definitely look.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. I have a question and a follow-up, please. I guess a cynic could say Apple is benefiting from an extra week this quarter and is benefiting from Samsung being in complete disarray. And yet from your guidance, it's unclear that iPhone unit growth will be up or certainly not up more than low single-digits implied from your guidance. And I appreciate some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the launch, but if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new products, your major competitor's laying down, you have an enormous, you have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably 7% or 8%, and yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish, what does that really say about how investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing forward? And is it reasonable to think that this is an ongoing growing business for the company?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Toni, let me take this one. I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago. You're right, we've got an extra few days. You know very well the launch timing is different. You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now. But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply constrained on 7 and 7 Plus. And so when you talk about other competitors, it's not particularly relevant to us right now because we are selling everything that we can produce. And so when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total company of course, we believe that revenue's going to grow. You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Tim, if I could ask you one, please. You've talked in the past about television being an area of intense interest. I was wondering if you could reaffirm that statement. Is that still the case? And then additionally, given what's happening with acquisitions, how broadly you think about the role of content. Apple has started creating on a very limited scale some of its own content and whether you think content creation and ownership is important to Apple, or whether Apple ultimately sees its place in the value chain as being more around the ecosystem and distribution.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started with focusing on some original content, as you point out. We've got a few things going there that we've talked about. And I think it's a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. and so it's is an area that we're focused on.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, Simona Jankowski.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. I have a question for Luca and then one for Tim as well. Luca, I wanted to dig into the Services business a bit more. As you pointed out, it accelerated again to 24%. How does that compare to the pace of growth of the installed base, just to help us decouple how much of it is consumption driven on a per user basis versus the base as a whole?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Simona, the installed base number is something that we talk about periodically. The last time we talked about it, it was in the January call. It is growing. Our installed base is growing very well, which is very important for us. It's growing on all major products and it's growing of course in total. When you look at our Services revenue, the growth of the Services revenue has been accelerating during the course of the year during a period when, as you know, our revenue came down slightly. So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services over time tend spend more and more on our services. We've got customers that are very engaged with our products. They're very loyal, and so you see this upward trajectory of our Services business. It's not only with the App Store but there's several categories that are growing very well for us. Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we got other parts of the business that continue to do well, even as I said during a period of time when our sales have come down a bit.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. And then Tim, we've seen an increasing focus on artificial intelligence, both in smartphones like the new Pixel from Google but also in some of the home assistance, like the Amazon Echo. And you guys have obviously had Siri for a while as well. But I just am curious how you think about balancing AI with your focus on privacy. And then also how important it is to have a dedicated home assistant versus just having the phone as the home assistant?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I think to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. And we live in a mobile society. People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. And so the advantage of having a assistant on your phone is it's with you all the time. That doesn't say that there is not a nice market for a home one. I'm not making that point. I'm just saying on a balance point of view, I think the usage of one on the phone will likely be much greater. In fact, you can just look at Siri today and this is now accelerating with iOS 10 and the Mac, but we've been getting 2 billion requests a week for Siri. And so it's very large and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assistant enabled devices than probably anyone out there. Our focus is on this worldwide, and so it's not only a U.S. focus, but we want to deliver a great experience around the world and deliver it globally, and so we've put a lot of the energy into doing that. In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, but at a high level, I think it's a false trade-off that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. We don't buy that. It may take a different kind of work. It might take more thinking, but I don't think we should throw our privacy away. It's sort of like the age-old argument about privacy versus security. We should have both. It shouldn't be making a choice. And so that at a high level is how we see it.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted ask you about the total deferred revenue which was down about $1.3 billion in June and I think down another $400 million in September. Those are rather large declines, even given the fact that your units are coming down and you had the accounting change back in September. Could you talk about some of the drivers of that and what you might expect going forward?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Steve, you mentioned by far the largest driver. The largest driver is the fact that we made the change, an accounting change to our ESPs exactly a year ago. So we are lapping the year where you see the effect. I think you're not going to see the same thing going forward. And then we tend to defer some revenue on some other categories, like for example gift cards or some AppleCare, but in general by far the largest element is the change in ESPs. And again, I don't think you're going to see the same impact going forward.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then, Tim, some investors are antsy that Apple has not acquired new profit pools or introduced a financially material new product in recent years. The question is, A, does Apple today have a grand strategy for what you want to do? I know you won't tell us what it us, but do you know what you want to do over the next three to maybe five years? Or is it more a read the market and quickly react? And B, do you have any sense that we're kind of in a gap period where the technology and arguably what we'd call the next job to be done haven't yet aligned? And so maybe in a couple years, we will see this flurry of new products and it'll sort of match what people want to do, but it's not quite here yet?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it. But as usual, we're not going to talk about what's ahead.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: But in terms of your approach I guess to new products, do you have a strong sense of where technology is going and where you're going to play? Or is it still enough up the year that you are willing to react fairly quickly, which arguably your organization allows you to do for the size of company you are?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We have a strong sense of where things go and we're very agile to shift as we need to.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Bank of America, Wamsi Mohan.\nWamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thank you. So, Tim and Luca, you saw that you could raise the ASP on the iPhone 7 Plus by $20 and you're completely sold out. So clearly this device plays a central role in our lives, so much that owners probably look at that incremental cost as a great trade-off to get the best device out there. So as you see more and more features being added into iPhones, do you conceptually expect that you are anywhere close to the point where raising ASPs further would be net disruptive to demand? Or do you see more rooms to raise ASPs over time as you add incremental features? And I have a follow up.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: With the iPhone 7 Plus, we put an incredible amount of innovation into the camera and the overall photo experience, and customers are obviously using that and have discovered that they love it. And so we're getting an incredible amount of feedback there. We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. And, but the mix that we projected on iPhone 7 Plus is short of what the reality is and so we are chasing supply there. In terms of the ASP, the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price and so we don't want to charge more than that, and we think it's worth being fair. And so that's how we look at it.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: If I can add, Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of countries around the world, the reality is that our customers have seen some significant price increases because of the FX situation, right. And that's something that we need to keep in mind as well.\nWamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. And Tim, this year we saw carrier incentives come back to force post the launch of the iPhone 7, 7 Plus. Two years ago there was a giant upgrade to iPhone from the iPhone 6, 6 Plus. Do you think every couple of years we are likely to see carrier incentives come back into play given worries around customer churn, thereby making the phone even more affordable? Thanks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We clearly saw that this year. There's a lot of competition for customers in the U.S. which I think is the market that you're talking about. Whether that'll happen every two years, I don't know. But I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers.\nWamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thanks, Tim.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Jim Suva with Citi.\nJames D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you very much. A strategy question for Tim and then more of a financial question for Luca. Tim, you'd mentioned in your prepared comments a little bit about India and we've been doing a lot of work talking about the opportunity in India. And we get a lot of pushback talking about disposable income metrics and lots of things like that, yet the population being so large, can you talk a little bit about, do you see that India could at some point be as big of an opportunity as China? And it appears that the legal rules have kind of prevented you from going in a lot, but it looks like that's changing. Can you just kind of give us a little more clarity on India? And then, Tim, for the clarification questions, is it fair to say that the OpEx has a disproportionate more expense side with the 14th week that we should kind of think of maybe as we go forward, that we shouldn't expect the OpEx to kind of be chugging along at that high rate? Or is it just kind of the rate of investing that you're going? Thank you very much, gentlemen.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll let Luca talk about the OpEx piece of it. On India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade. And the age of the population, if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25. And so you have a very, very young population. The smartphone has not done as well in India in general. However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. But this year or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G and we couldn't be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhone to produce that great experience for people. And so I see a lot of the factors moving in the right direction there. I also think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure and on creating jobs, which is fantastic, because you really need the kind of infrastructure and the technology to do that. Will it be as big as China? I think it's clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. I think it will take longer for the GDP to rival it, but that's not critical for us to have a great success there. The truth is, there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there is a lot of headroom there in our mind, and so we are working very hard to realize that opportunity.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: And, Jim, on OpEx, our approach to OpEx is quite clear and quite simple. We want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think is critical for us to invest. So you see that we make significant investments in R&D. You've seen the growth rates over the last couple of years. We are making important investments in data centers because we want to support our services business. We continue to open retail stores around the world. We continue to invest in marketing and advertising. At the same time, we want to continue to be efficient and lean. It's something that we've done very well over the years and want to continue to do that. So what you've seen, for example in fiscal 2016, you've seen investments in R&D growing at 25% and then our SG&A expenses to be about flat. And this is kind of the approach that we want to take and continue to take going forward. If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we got an expense to revenue ratio of 9%. This is extremely competitive in our industry and I would say in general. And so we want to continue to have this balance, make the right investments and remain efficient.\nJames D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you, and congratulations and thanks for the details, gentleman.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan.\nRod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I had one for Luca and then a follow-up for Tim. So, Luca, I wanted to ask about the gross margin guidance. I think that the Street and we were expecting something a little bit higher. And again, that's about 50 basis points lower and the Street it was I think 70 basis points lower. And I'm just curious, do you think that people are mis-modeling that or is there something going on with pricing or mix there that you could provide us more color on? So that's my first question.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, Rod, let me give you some detail both on a sequential basis and I'll give you also something on a year-over-year basis because maybe that's where the disconnect comes from, looking at the last year's gross margins in the December quarter. On a sequential basis, we are essentially guiding to some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive, we're going to have of course better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. But we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are launching now and we've launched already a few during the September quarter and that will have an impact on our December quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, keep in mind that last year we did, in Q1, we did 40%, around 40%, 40%, 41%, but there's a couple of things that I think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare. And it's the fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million. That is, at the gross margin level, is 40 bps. And then we've got the FX situation, which I mentioned before, which is worth another 60 bps, 70 bps. And so you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a year-over-year basis where again, we have the reality of new cost structures into our products. It is very, very important I think for investors to understand that what's happened during the last two years. During the last two years, the U.S. dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. So on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015 was 340 bps impact from foreign exchange. This is something that we have offset almost entirely through a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program, but at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal and we need to work with that. And I think over the years, we made very good trade-offs and our gross margins have been quite stable over time.\nRod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks, Luca. And then, Tim, I wanted you to ask you, this question comes up once in a while, but I just wanted to ask you if you could talk to us a little bit about the arguments on both sides of the dividend question. I mean, Apple seems to be perpetually undervalued. It's a very large company. It's getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is significantly below the S&P 500. I know you can't tell us what your intentions are here, but if you could help us understand how that thinking around the dividend works, it would be great.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We review the capital return annually, and we've established a cadence now to announce our thinking on that every April. And so we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback. We very much believe that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the company that we know really well. And so that thinking has I think proven out over time and I think been very good for our shareholders. And in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we've provided a amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually. And so we'll be able to say more on that I'm sure in April of next year.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Rod.\nRod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. And after that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenues, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015, the Forms 10-Q for the first two quarters of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as installed base related purchases. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our Investor Relations website at Apple.com/investor. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we're pleased to report third quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated just 90 days ago and include several encouraging signs. Revenue of $42.4 billion was near the high end of our guidance range and gross margin of 38% was at the top of our guidance range. We achieved these results while reducing channel inventory by about $3.6 billion, significantly more than the $2 billion inventory reduction we had expected. So our sell-through was markedly greater than our sell-in. iPhone accounted for the vast majority of the channel inventory reduction. iPhone unit sell-through was down just 8% year on year, an even greater improvement over the March quarter than we predicted, and we expect the September quarter sell-through comparison to improve further. We feel good about our channel inventory levels and believe they position us well for the months ahead. We had a very successful global launch of iPhone SE, and demand outstripped supply throughout the quarter. We brought on additional capacity and were able to achieve supply/demand balance as we entered the September quarter. At its launch, we said that the addition of the iPhone SE to the iPhone lineup placed us in a better position to meet the needs of customers who love a four-inch phone and to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. In both cases, that strategy is working. Our initial sales data tells us that the iPhone SE is popular in both developed and emerging markets, and the percentage of iPhone SE sales going to customers who are new to iPhone is greater than we've seen in the first weeks of availability for other iPhones launched in the last several years. Overall, we added millions of first-time smartphone buyers in the June quarter, and switchers accounted for the highest percentage of quarterly iPhone sales we've ever measured. In absolute terms, our year-to-date iPhone sales to switchers are the greatest we've seen in any nine-month period, and our active installed base of iPhones is up strong double-digits year over year. We saw tremendous performance from our Services businesses, which grew 19% to a June quarter record of $6 billion. The growth was broad-based, with App Store revenue up 37% to a new all-time high, in addition to strong increases in Music, iCloud, and AppleCare. In the last 12 months, our Services revenue is up almost $4 billion year on year to $23.1 billion, and we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company next year. Most of our terrific Services performance during the quarter was fueled by our active installed base of devices, with installed base-related purchases of $10.3 billion accelerating to 29% growth year on year. We had our best iPad compare in 10 quarters, with revenue growing 7% thanks to the rollout of the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. We're proud to have the most exciting lineup of tablets and accessories in the world and exceptionally high customer satisfaction and engagement. Our surveys also show that about half of iPad Pro purchases are buying them for work. iPad Pro is the ultimate upgrade for existing iPad users and the ultimate replacement device for customers switching from PC notebooks. Apple Watch continues to be the best-selling smartwatch in the world. And just this month, J.D. Power ranked it highest in customer satisfaction among all smartwatches. With watchOS 3 coming this fall, customers will be able to update their Apple Watches with an enhanced user interface, significantly improved performance and all-new fitness and health capabilities, including activity sharing. We're just getting started with the Apple Watch, and we look forward to even more exciting announcements in this space. On a personal note, during the past quarter I visited China and India, and I am very encouraged about our growth prospects in those countries. We remain very optimistic about the long-term opportunities in Greater China and we continue to invest there. We opened our 41st Greater China retail store during the quarter, and we also made a $1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing. Switchers and first-time smartphone buyers represented the lion's share of our iPhone sales in the quarter, and our installed base of iPhones in China has grown by 34% over the last year alone. According to China Mobile, there are more iPhones on their network than any other brand, with iPhone users ranking first in terms of customer loyalty, data usage and ARPU. By far, the largest portion of our global channel inventory reduction was in Greater China, so our underlying business there is stronger than our results imply. We face some challenges in Greater China, as the economic environment has slowed down since the beginning of the year. This is reflected in consumer confidence and retail spending, and the Chinese yuan has depreciated by 7% relative to the U.S. dollar since August of last year. Hong Kong's tourism and retail businesses also continue to be significantly impacted by the stronger Hong Kong dollar relative to other Asian currencies. Combining this backdrop with the tough comparison to last year, when revenue grew 112%, and the channel inventory reduction this year, we're reporting a decline in revenue in the June quarter. But to keep things in perspective, when we look back on our accomplishments in this segment over the last couple of years, they are truly remarkable. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our total revenue from Greater China was almost $40 billion, up 55% from the same timeframe just two years ago, while iPhone units were up 47%. India is now one of our fastest growing markets. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51% year on year. We just announced a first of its kind design and development accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS, and we opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate maps development. We're looking forward to opening retail stores in India down the road, and we see huge potential for that vibrant country. As we look forward to the fall, we are thrilled by customers' response to the software and services we previewed at our Worldwide Developers Conference last month. This was our biggest WWDC ever. And for the first time, we have four innovative Apple platforms for our developers' apps, iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. In fact, iOS 10 will be the biggest release ever for iOS. The momentum of all four platforms shows the strong relationship Apple enjoys with customers throughout their day and wherever they go, whether it's at home, in their car, at work, or everywhere in between. The Apple ecosystem is thriving and growing, and our new OS releases this fall will take these great experiences to a new level. Customers can look forward to more expressive ways to communicate with messages now with its own App Store, allowing users to create and share content, make payments, add stickers and more, all without leaving messages, which is now one of the largest messaging services in the world. Customers can also look forward to a broader and more intelligent role for Siri, which will work with your favorite apps from the App Store, so you can ask Siri to book a ride with your favorite ride sharing app or send money to someone with Square. There are also beautifully redesigned apps for music, maps and news, significant enhancements to HomeKit, CarPlay, and the Health app, building on our strategy to give users a seamless experience in all aspects of their lives. There's also a major update with macOS Sierra, with new features like Siri and Apple Pay that make the Mac smarter and more helpful than ever, and even stronger continuity features across all the Apple devices. These experiences become more powerful and intuitive as we continue our long history of enriching our products through advanced artificial intelligence. We have focused our AI efforts on the features that best enhance the customer experience. For example, machine learning enables Siri to understand words as well as the intent behind them. That means Siri does a better job understanding and even predicting what you want, then delivering the right responses to requests. To make Siri an even smarter assistant, we're opening the service to developers, and this fall Siri will be available across our entire product line. We're also using machine learning in many other ways across our products and services, including recommending songs, apps, and news. Machine learning is improving facial and image recognition in photos, predicting word choice while typing in messages and mail, and providing context awareness in maps for better directions. Deep learning within our products even enables them to recognize usage patterns and improve their own battery life. And most importantly, we deliver these intelligent services while protecting users' privacy. Most of the AI processing takes place on the device rather than being sent to the cloud. And starting this fall, we'll be using sophisticated technology called differential privacy, enhancing our ability to deliver the kinds of services we dream of and customers love without compromising on the individual privacy our customers have come to expect from us. This fall we'll also bring Apple Pay to Safari so users can easily make secure and private purchases when shopping on participating websites. Tens of millions of users around the world are enjoying Apple Pay today at stores and in app, with estimated monthly active users up more than 450% year on year last month. Leading financial partners tell us that three out of four contactless payments in the U.S. are made with Apple Pay. This is amazing. There are more than 11 million contactless-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is available today, including 3 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States. With the launch of France, Switzerland, and Hong Kong this month, Apple Pay is now live in nine markets, including six of our top 10. Adoption outside the U.S. has been explosive, with over half of transaction volume now coming from non-U.S. markets. With our latest OS releases, the unparalleled continuity across Apple devices will become even more powerful. For example, macOS Sierra will sense other devices and use secure protocols to communicate. With an authenticated Apple Watch, I can auto-unlock my Mac when I open it without typing a password. With Universal Clipboard, I can copy and paste text, images, and even video between my iOS devices and my Mac. And I can automatically access the files on my Mac desktop and documents folder from another Mac, iOS device, or even a PC. Innovations like these are the kinds of things that only Apple can do. We have an incredible lineup of products in our pipeline, and I'm very bullish about our long-term opportunity. Now I'd like to hand it over to Luca to share more details with you on the June quarter.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $42.4 billion, near the high end of our guidance range, compared to $49.6 billion in the year-ago quarter. Customer demand for our products and services was stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. As Tim mentioned, we reduced overall channel inventories by roughly $3.6 billion. On a geographic basis, our revenue grew strongly in Japan to a new June quarter record, and we experienced healthy growth in a number of other important markets, including Russia, Brazil, Turkey, India, and Canada. Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.9% of revenue, and net income was $7.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.42, and cash flow from operations was strong at $10.6 billion. For details by product, I will start with the iPhone. We sold 40.4 million iPhones in the quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by over 4 million units compared to about 0.5 million units a year ago, so sell-through was down by 8%. We exited the quarter near the low end of our five-week to seven-week target range for channel inventory. The rollout of our new entry-level iPhone SE concurrent with the channel reduction of more than 4 million higher-end iPhones resulted in a lower than usual iPhone ASP of $595. Therefore, we expect ASPs to improve this quarter. We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets, with sales in Russia more than doubling year over year, and double-digit growth in many other key countries, including Japan, Turkey, Brazil, India, Canada, and Sweden. iPhone continues to show great momentum in business markets. A recent survey by 451 Research found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPhones. This is the highest corporate purchase intent ever measured by the survey for the September quarter. Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 19% over the June quarter last year. We set a new record for customers transacting on our iTunes Stores. And among our customers who purchase apps and content, the average amount spent per customer was the highest that we've ever measured. The App Store's growth rate has now accelerated for four consecutive quarters, reaching 37% in Q3. The App Store is overwhelmingly the preferred destination for both customers and developers. According to App Annie, we generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the June quarter, widening our lead from the March quarter. Because of this continued growth, for the first nine months of our fiscal year, Services increased from 8% of our total revenue a year ago to 11% this year, and it represents an even higher percentage of our profitability. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.3 million Macs compared to 4.8 million last year. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, with IDC estimating a 4% global contraction. In addition to the overall market slowdown, we faced a very difficult compare to the year-ago quarter, when we introduced a new MacBook Pro and a new iMac. Despite these challenges, Mac continues to gain a high percentage of new customers, and our Mac installed base has grown to a new all-time high at the end of the June quarter. We ended the quarter below our four-week to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Now turning to iPad, revenue grew 7%. iPad ASP was $490 compared to $415 in the year-ago quarter, with the increase driven by iPad Pro, and we sold 10 million iPads compared to 10.9 million in the year-ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 500,000 units and exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range. In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the overall U.S. tablet market in the June quarter and has 84% share of tablets priced above $200. And in May, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini and a 95% rate for iPad Air. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 63% plan to purchase an iPad, almost four times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers report a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 71% for the September quarter. One recent example of iPad business adoption is Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, which is adding 22,000 iPads to more than 10,000 purchased last year to deploy corporate mobility solutions across the organization and enable its consultants to serve customers in a more engaging and more efficient way. More broadly, we're making great progress with our enterprise initiatives and we see strong growth opportunities ahead of us. In May, we announced a global strategic partnership with SAP to reimagine business processes with native iOS apps. SAP is the world's largest enterprise software provider, with more than 130 million potential users among its 300,000 global customers. In fact, it's estimated that 76% of global business transactions touch an SAP system. Our partnership will deliver an SDK to fast-track iOS projects for SAP environments, an iOS academy to enable the 2.5 million SAP developers around the world to build great native iOS apps, and a portfolio of industry-specific apps to accelerate mobile transformation in the enterprise. Last month, we announced the first three solutions from our Cisco partnership, two that will dramatically improve the network performance of iOS traffic running on Cisco networks, and one that will bring the desk phone to the 21st century by integrating iPhone Wi-Fi calling into Cisco Spark. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $231.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential decrease of $1.4 billion. $214.8 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued a total $2.4 billion of debt in Taiwan and in Australia, while retiring $2.5 billion in U.S. debt, leaving us with $72 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter, essentially unchanged from last quarter. We returned a total of over $13 billion to investors during the June quarter as follows. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalent. We spent $4 billion on repurchases of 41.2 million Apple shares through open-market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 48.2 million shares. We also completed our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 8.7 million shares. We've now completed almost $177 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $127 billion in share repurchases. During the quarter, we also spent $1 billion on a minority investment in Didi Chuxing in China, completed three acquisitions and incurred $4.2 billion in capital expenditures. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.050 billion and $6.150 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $350 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2016 to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2016. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much for the question. Tim, can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on investments? You made the Didi investment this quarter. Obviously, you continue to make acquisitions over time. We just saw I guess you invested in buying some of Carpool Karaoke. I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about where you're putting your investment dollars for more of an acquisition or a potential equity stake standpoint as you look at overall capital allocation.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Shannon, we obviously invest a ton of capital in our business itself to support research and development and the production of our products. And that's the main source of our capital. However, we're constantly looking on the outside for great talent and great intellectual property. And we have been buying companies on average every three to four weeks or so, and we continue to do that. And we think we've made some really great choices there. In terms of the investment in Didi, it was an unusual investment in that, as you know, we don't have a long history of doing a lot of these, but we have done some before. We invested in ARM in the early days. We invested in Akamai and a few other companies. So it wasn't the first. From a Didi point of view, we see that as, one, a great financial investment. Two, we think that there are some strategic things that the companies can do together over time. And three, we think that we'll learn a lot about the business and the Chinese market even beyond what we currently know, and Didi has an incredible team there. And so that's the rationale for why we did that. Would we do more investments? Yes, but it's not something that you'll see a whole string of from us. But we will constantly look for things that are smart to do.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Great. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up for Luca. If you could, talk a little bit about the gross margin puts and takes for guidance, 37% to 38%. How are you thinking about commodity pricing and mix of the new products and that just as you look to how you guided gross margin?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes, Shannon. Let me correct you. It's 37.5% to 38%...\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Sorry. I had that written down, but I said the wrong thing.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: ...for the September quarter. So essentially, we're guiding GM flat to slightly down sequentially. On the positive side, we're going to have leverage because we are guiding to a sequential increase in revenue, and we expect to have positive mix as we get into the September quarter, and these positives being offset more or less by what we call product transition costs, which are typical at this time of the year for us.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Great. Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Shannon, on the commodity side and for the September quarter, we see NAND being pretty much in balance while DRAM and LCDs and other major commodities remain in an oversupply situation. And so overall commodity prices we expect to decline at at-least historical rates.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From UBS, we'll hear from Steve Milunovich.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Great, thank you very much. Regarding your revenue guidance for September, it's up about 10% sequentially, which is clearly at the high end historically. So what can you tell us about the timing of the new iPhone model? Is that affecting this? You mentioned that 451 Research is finding business interest in phones, but their survey on consumers actually finds the lowest level of expectation for purchases in the next three months since 2008. You've seen the upgrade numbers from the carriers are quite low. So it seems like it's still a very tough demand environment. So where is the strength coming from in the September quarter?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Steve, we're not going to get into products or product transition. However, we've taken what we've learned from last quarter, and we did see a number of encouraging signs. Luca talked about the number of countries that we saw double-digit growth in during the quarter, from Japan to Brazil to India, some even stronger numbers than that in Russia. So there's a number of countries that we saw strong signals from that perspective. We also are very happy with the switcher rate that we saw, our highest ever recorded. And the number of switchers through the nine months are the highest absolute numbers that we've ever had. And so when we look at that and then we look at the things going on, on our other products and services, and we think Services will continue to grow very briskly. We've made our best estimate of where we think we'll come in, and that's $45.5 billion to $47.5 billion.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, fair enough. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you about your platform strategy. You talk about the four operating systems essentially as platforms, which I agree with. And it's just interesting to me because Apple has such a control over the vertical integration of your products, and yet you've somehow been able to grasp the openness that's required for platforms. And I think that's reflected in WWDC, as you pointed out, opening up APIs and so forth on messaging. And you made the case there for apps versus messaging and the anti-bot argument. I'm just curious. Is that the way \u2013 am I characterizing this roughly correctly in terms about how you think about the business? And how are you managing that internally in terms of having this vertically integrated somewhat closed view of the hardware and yet this pretty open platform where the value is created externally?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We think to have a great platform you have to have a really healthy ecosystem. And so we're really proud of the developer community and the fact that developers are earning a lot more money in writing for iOS than other apps. We think that the best experience for users include apps, and so we want to do everything that we can do to continue building that. We now have over 2 million apps in the App Store and are more focused these days on discovery and other things to bring more great apps to the service because there are so many out there. And so that's what we're doing. The TV, and you didn't mention CarPlay, but these are trying to provide our users a seamless experience across all the different things that they do in their lives. And so that's the rationale for CarPlay. It's the rationale for why we're putting a huge investment in the home, making \u2013 really bringing home automation to life for people in a very simple and elegant way. It's the reason for Apple TV and what we're doing in the living room. And so all these things, all these things together are all about the user experience and making people's daily lives better.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Luca, as it relates to gross margin, the guidance today is very similar to what you've provided over the last five years in terms of gross margin guidance in September versus June. And the variances that you walked through in response to Shannon's questions are very similar to the dynamics that you see in any September quarter. But there's an added factor this time around, which is you don't have the 4 million units of high-ASP, high-margin inventory drain in September like you did in the June quarter. So I guess I'd just push back and ask why gross margin guidance wouldn't be even better? Is it the more balanced NAND environment that Tim spoke to, or is there something else impacting the guidance?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Katy, I've talked about these elements at a broad level. Of course, there are degrees of positive impact. We for example on the mix front, every cycle is slightly different on our product mix, and so that clearly has an impact on gross margins. And the other thing that we need to keep in mind as we step back for a second and now we've gone through a couple of cycles where the U.S. dollar has strengthened. And as you know, we work with our hedging program where we get protection from FX fluctuations in the short term. When these hedges roll off over time, we end up replacing them with new hedging contracts at spot rates. And so versus September of 2014, for example, the U.S. dollar has now strengthened on average against international currencies by about 15%. And I think we need to accept that now we're living in this stronger U.S. dollar environment. We've taken a lot of actions on the cost side, on the pricing side, and obviously with hedges. But we need to deal with this situation, and that's where we are right now. We feel that 37.5% to 38% given the new FX environment I think says a lot about all the work that we've done on the cost side to get there. Just to give you a sense, on a year-over-year basis, when I look at foreign exchange, that has an impact of almost 300 basis points on our margins.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. And, Tim, can you speak to how you envision the upgrade rate of the iPhone installed base to play out over the next quarter or the next year? Somebody mentioned that U.S. carriers have reported really weak upgrade rates, not necessarily for iPhone, but across their installed base. The press is discussing only modest technology upgrades in your next iPhone cycle. And so those data points would lead investors to believe that the upgrade rate will be low, but curious if you have a different view. Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I don't want to talk about phones that aren't announced. And so that aside, what we have seen in the past tense or current tense on the upgrade rate is that the iPhone upgrade rate for the iPhone 6S is very similar to the iPhone 5S. And I guess in retrospect, maybe that was a predictable thing, although we didn't predict it in the beginning. It took us a little time to realize that. The iPhone 6 was significantly higher than that, and so it likely accelerated upgrades that would have been in the current year ahead of those. And so what the future holds, we'll see. But I'm very optimistic about the future because I see so many signs that are positive. I see an installed base that has gotten incredibly large. I see a switcher rate that is the highest ever. I see the smartphone itself, led by iPhone, becoming even more instrumental and important to people's lives. It's becoming essential. And all of the things that are coming both in the fall, the things that we've announced that you can see with iOS 10, hopefully you're running by now with the beta, those and other things make it even more instrumental. And AI even makes it even more and more. As the phone becomes more and more your assistant, it's one of those that you're not going to leave without it. And so I see all of those things as vectors that are incredibly positive. I also really like what I've seen with the iPhone SE and the fact that it's opening the door to customers that we weren't reaching before and likely convincing some people to upgrade that wanted a smaller form factor but wanted to stay with iPhone, and so they were waiting for the iPhone SE. And so I see lots of positive things, and so that's how I look at it.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research: Yes, thank you. You commented about the significant inventory drawdown in the quarter, $3.6 billion on the revenue side. So sell-through was $46 billion effectively, over 4 million iPhones, suggesting that sell-through iPhone sales were 45 million. When I look to your guidance for Q4, I actually have the opposite question of a previous question, which is in light of the true sell-through rate, which seems to reflect better than normal seasonality in Q3, likely some contribution and elasticity from the SE, when I look at Q4, it looks like you're guiding for iPhone unit on a sell-through basis to be flat or potentially down and for total company revenues to be only fractionally up and below the seasonality we see in Q4. So I guess my question is, are you expecting any drawdowns in channel inventory in fiscal Q4? Are my inferences around sell-through rate incorrect? Or given the business momentum that you spoke about in response to an earlier question and the hopefulness that you expressed in your prepared remarks, Tim, I'm actually surprised that the guidance isn't a bit stronger on the top line.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Toni, let me take it. Starting with your comments on the June quarter, I just want to point out that when we talk about a $3.6 billion channel inventory reduction, that is not entirely related to iPhone. iPhone is the vast majority of that, but we did reduce channel inventory on all other products as well. So that probably leads you to different conclusions to the math that you have just expressed. On the September quarter, when I look at the sequential increase for iPhone units that we are expecting, I would say that it is, even with the sell-through adjustments that you've talked about, it's still pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past. As you know, we do not provide guidance for channel inventory. But I would say, in general, I think it's important to keep in mind that if we look around the world, we do see a lot of positive signs, but we also know that the macroeconomic environment is slowing down in a number of places around the world. And that needs to be taken into account in our guidance.\nToni Sacconaghi - Bernstein Research: Okay. Luca, I did understand the $3.6 billion, but you said over 4 million iPhones were drawn down. I added that to the 40.4 million, so that would suggest close to 45 million on a sell-through basis. So that was the basis for my observation. I was wondering if I could direct one at Tim. You talked about the upgrade cycle and how it elongated relative to the iPhone 6 and that it's similar to what you saw with the iPhone 5S. And my belief is that one of the bigger longer-term concerns for Apple is that the replacement cycle could just structurally elongate over time, particularly as your installed base of customers becomes less affluent and more international. So I guess my question is, you have a mechanism, which is the Apple Upgrade Program, which takes replacement cycle out of the equation and puts people on buying the phone as a service. And so I'd welcome any comments on how that program is doing. And then just more broadly, is Apple thinking about ways to sell not only the iPhone, but more of its products on a monthly type subscription basis, perhaps in a more bundled fashion so that you can add more predictability to what is now largely a transactional revenue model?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: The iPhone demand is made up, as you know, of upgraders, switchers and new to smartphone. And so if you take it in reverse order for a minute and look at a new smartphone, smartphone penetration right now around the world at the end of December was 42%. And so there's quite a bit of room there. It is true that a lot of those are in emerging markets, but we have done \u2013 we've had reasonable business success in several emerging markets. And so we don't enter into those with no experience, although we will enter into them humbly. On the switcher side, we really like what we're seeing. And we think that from a user point of view, as the smartphone itself becomes more and more essential to people's daily lives, which is a part of what I had talked about before, a part of bringing it into the home in a bigger way and in the car and at work and so forth, we think people will put more and more focus on what they're buying and the thing that Apple does best, which is provide this killer experience. A killer user experience that's integrated across their lives I think becomes more important and I think that really plays to our advantage. I also think that the deployment of AI technology is something that we will excel at because of our focus on user experience, and so I like that. From an upgrade point of view, there are pluses and minuses as I see it. A plus is that more and more people have already joined upgrade programs. Some of these programs, like the one that you referenced that we've done, replaces the iPhone every year. There are also carriers that have similar kind of plans, where they also replace or change out the iPhone every year. Others have an 18-month clock. Some have a 24-month clock, and there are even some that have a 30-month clock. And so there's various time schedules there. And so, as of today, there are obviously a lot more people on those programs than ever before because they just started. It really got underway in a big way last year, in a smaller way two years ago. And so we'll see more of those this coming fall. The minus side is that the bifurcation of the smartphone from the service itself has a plus and a minus into it. The subsidy, the lack of that \u2013 and this is more of a U.S. phenomenon than the rest of the world, some of that can be a shock for people that were used to paying $199 for their smartphone. They come back in and they pay less for the service but they pay more for their smartphone. And so there's lots of pluses and minuses on this. But overall, as I look at this for Apple, and this is not a statement on the industry itself, but for Apple, I'm very optimistic.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, Simona Jankowski.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Tim, as you mentioned, you traveled to China during the quarter. And while you certainly sound encouraged on China and highlighted the Didi investment, there are some of the key services for Apple like iBooks and iTunes Movies that are still banned, and some of the local vendors appear to be gaining share. So can you just give us your perspective on the market, your expectations around getting those services back up, and also regaining share?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes, for books and movies, we currently have those stores off, as you mentioned. To put this in some context, those two stores for the months that we had them operational, which was several months, the revenue was less than $1 million. And so it's not a revenue-related issue. From our point of view, this is a service we want to provide our customers. And so we're working very closely with the appropriate government agencies, and we hope to make books and movies available again to our customers there. And so we'll see how that goes, but we're optimistic there.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And in terms of just regaining share in that market more broadly?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I think we've always had \u2013 if you look at our share over time, our share in China tends to peak during launch windows. There's a higher high and a lower low there. There's a bigger difference between those two. And so what we have to do and what we're doing is innovating like crazy and delivering the best smartphone to our customers there. And if we do a really great job of that, which we will, then I'm confident that we'll do well.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good afternoon. Tim, you gave some nice data points around Apple Pay. Can you remind us? Is this a business that ultimately impacts the Services line in any measurable way, or is Apple Pay generally about selling iPhones? And separately, when you just take a step back and look at the proof point that the augmented reality [AR] theme has had with this whole Pok\u00e9mon phenomenon, how does it impact how you think about the future? I assume you think about it. I'm just curious what goes on in your mind when you see all that. Thanks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: On the Apple Pay side, the revenues from Apple Pay are in the Services line. The growth is astronomical, but the base is very small. And so for today, Apple Pay is very much about a great feature for our customers so that they can pay in a very simple, private, and secure way. In terms of AR and the Pok\u00e9mon phenomenon, it's incredible what has happened there. I think it's a testament to what happens with innovative apps and the whole ecosystem and the power of being a developer being able to press a button, so to speak, and offer their product around the world. And just a certain developer has elected not to go worldwide yet because of the pressure on their servers, et cetera, because of the demand. But I'm sure that they will over time. It also does show, as you point out, that AR can be really great. And we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity. And so we're investing, and the number one thing is to make sure our products work well with other developers' products like Pok\u00e9mon. And so that's the reason why you see so many iPhones out in the wild right now chasing Pok\u00e9mons.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Would you say there's going to be a computing shift to AR longer term?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I notice there are people that want to call it a new computer platform, and we'll see. I think there's a tendency in this industry to call everything new the next computer platform. However, that said, I think AR can be huge. So we'll see whether it's the next platform. But regardless, it will be huge.\nGene Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.\nMark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I just want to follow up, Tim, if I could, related to the R&D pace of growth, clearly a lot of momentum there over the last couple years. But we're just trying to figure out how much of that is dedicated to existing products and services versus what's next? Can you give us a sense in terms of when investors should think about the ROI coming back to them from the R&D perspective? And a corollary to that, is it really restricted just to products and services currently, or can we see more of a cloud services apparatus evolve over time where you do more and more in the enterprise just given the core trips with SAP and Cisco and IBM? And then my follow-up for Luca is around ASPs for the iPhone. We keep getting a lot of questions around iPhone SE in terms of how cannibalistic could it be to the core iPhone franchise. Are you seeing any moderation in terms of the ASP pressures here?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: On R&D growth, we do continue to invest significantly in R&D. The growth rates are still large on a year-over-year basis, and Luca can share the exact ones. But I think the recent quarter was in the mid-20% for R&D. The balance of the company we're managing more flattish from a year-over-year point of view. The products that are in R&D, there is quite a bit of investment in there for products and services that are not currently shipping or derivations of what is currently shipping. And so I don't want to talk about the exact split of it. But you can look at the growth rate and conclude that there's a lot of stuff that we're doing beyond the current products.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Mark, on the ASP question, I talked about the $595 in Q3. It's down $65 on a year-over-year basis. Keep in mind, about $20 of that $65 is foreign exchange. So during the quarter, we had this combination of starting with no iPhone SE units in channel inventory, so we had to do an at least a partial channel fill that obviously had an impact on ASPs. And then the other element was the fact that we've reduced more than 4 million units of channel inventory on the high end. So the combination of these two things obviously had an impact on ASPs. But I think as I said or Tim said during the prepared remarks, we do expect iPhone ASP to improve sequentially as we move into the September quarter because these two factors that I just mentioned are not going to repeat. On cannibalization, of course we've got limited experience because the phone has been in the market just for a few weeks. But when we look at our survey data on iPhone SE, as Tim was saying, we believe that the iPhone SE is doing exactly what it was intended, which is we are seeing a higher rate of new to iPhone customers, which is obviously very important to us because we bring new people into the iOS ecosystem. And we see a higher rate of previous iPhone owners that really prefer the four-inch form factor. We have not seen clear evidence of cannibalization from iPhone 6S or iPhone 6S Plus. Of course, there's always going to be some level of cannibalization. But really to us what is much more relevant is the much bigger opportunity to bring more people into the iOS ecosystem.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Credit Suisse, we'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha.\nKulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, just a couple questions for me. Luca, I just want to clarify that last point on ASPs on iPhone because last quarter it seemed that you were quite clear that that was a negative driver to the gross margin of the company. So I understand there are other drivers going into the September quarter. But just to be clear, the phone units you didn't sell through that were depleted in channel inventory, those are relatively high gross margin as well. That's the clarification. And then for Tim, on the Services side, as Apple has spoken more and more loudly I guess in the last three or four quarters, I just think about some of the comments you've made about the TV market and how it's been stuck I think in the 1960s and the 1970s and the experience hasn't changed. I understand you've got the Apple TV box out. But in terms of driving actual video-on-demand services, is that something that Apple wants to do themselves? Do you want a partner? Could you even build content? How do you think about that as an actual business opportunity as opposed to here's an Apple box and we sell some units, but it's not that meaningful to the overall company in terms of size? I'm just curious given the installed base and users you have. Thanks.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Kulbinder, on your question on iPhone ASP, I'm not sure if I understood it correctly. But clearly the iPhone SE has a downward impact on iPhone ASP, of course, because it comes at the low end of the range. From a gross margin perspective, it is slightly dilutive to company margins, but the impact is not particularly large.\nKulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, okay.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: On the Apple TV question, the introduction of Apple TV and tvOS last October and the subsequent OS releases and what's coming out this fall, think of that as building the foundation for what we believe can be a broader business over time. And so I don't want to be more precise than that. But you shouldn't look at what's there today and think we've done what we want to do. We've built a foundation that we can do something bigger off of.\nKulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thank you for the question.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Kulbinder.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Speaking first is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, future business outlook, and plans for capital return and debt issuance. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2015, the Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. In addition, today's comments will refer to a metric we describe as the purchase value of services tied to our installed base. This is a non-GAAP measure, and a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure can be found on our Investor Relations website at Apple.com/investor. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we're reporting the results of a very busy and challenging quarter, and we're also announcing an update to our capital return program. Revenue for the quarter was $50.6 billion, which was within our guidance range. Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world and difficult year-over-year comparisons. We saw continued currency weakness in the vast majority of our international markets. In constant currency, our revenue declined by 9% from last year, 400 basis points less than the reported decline of 13%. For the first half of the fiscal year, our revenue in constant currency was up 1% year on year. Despite challenges, there were a number of encouraging signs during the quarter. Our installed base of over 1 billion active devices continued to grow strongly. We added a huge number of Android switchers and new-to-Mac customers, and we generated very strong growth from Services. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter, consistent with the range of our own expectations but lower than the exceptional year-ago quarter when we saw an acceleration in iPhone upgrades and 40% iPhone sales growth over the previous year. To provide some additional color, iPhone sales come from three sources: customers who upgrade from previous iPhone models; customers who switch from Android and other operating systems; and customers who purchase a smartphone for the first time. As we look at each of these three sources of iPhone sales, we see a business that is healthy and strong. First, from an upgrade perspective, during the first half of this year the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle has been slightly higher than what we experienced in the iPhone 5s cycle two years ago, but it is lower than the accelerated upgrade rate that we saw with iPhone 6, which as you know was a big contributor to our phenomenal revenue growth a year ago. Most importantly, our customers are incredibly loyal. A recent Kantar survey of U.S. smartphone purchasers indicated a 95% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured for any smartphone. Second, we continue to see a very high level of customers switching to iPhone from Android and other operating systems. In fact, we added more switchers from Android and other platforms in the first half of this year than any other six-month period ever. And third, with only 42% smartphone penetration of the global handset market today, iPhone is still attracting millions of first-time smartphone buyers each quarter, especially from emerging markets. For example, in India our iPhone sales were up 56% from a year ago. Next I'd like to talk about Services, which was our second largest revenue-generating category during the quarter. Setting aside the amount we received from a patent settlement in the December quarter, the March quarter Services revenue was our highest ever. Services revenue jumped 20% to $6 billion. App Store revenue was up 35% to beat last quarter's all-time record. And Apple Music continues to grow in popularity, with over 13 million paying subscribers today. We feel really great about the early success of Apple's first subscription business, and our Music revenue has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline. The Services business is powered by our huge installed base of active devices, which crossed 1 billion units earlier this year. As we discussed on this call in January, those 1 billion-plus active devices are a source of recurring revenue that is growing independent of the unit shipments we report every three months. In fact, the purchase value of services tied to our installed base was a record $9.9 billion in the March quarter, up 27% over last year, accelerating from the 24% growth rate we reported in the December quarter. The reach of Apple Pay also continues to expand following a very successful launch in China in the March quarter and last week's rollout in Singapore. Apple Pay is growing at a tremendous rate, with more than five times the transaction volume of a year ago and 1 million new users per week. There are more than 10 million contactless-ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay has launched to date, including over 2.5 million locations now accepting Apple Pay in the United States, and more expansion of Apple Pay is coming soon. Turning to the Mac, we met our sell-in expectations in addition to reducing channel inventory by about 100,000 units. Overall, the Mac continues to attract a large percentage of new customers. In our latest survey of major markets, over half of buyers were new to the Mac. And in some countries, the percentage is extremely high, like in China, where over 80% of customers were purchasing a Mac for the first time. We're confident in our Mac business and our ability to continue to innovate and gain share in that area. Turning to the Apple Watch, unit sales met our expectations in the quarter. For some color on how we think about Apple Watch sales, we expect its seasonality to be similar to the historical seasonality of iPod, which typically generated 40% or more of its annual unit sell-through in the December quarter. We started shipping Apple Watch just one year ago, and it has quickly become the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world. In fact, unit sales of Apple Watch during its first year exceeded sales of iPhone in its first year. Last month, we refreshed the lineup for the spring with new bands and a new starting price point, and the response from customers has been great. Apple Watch is an increasingly essential part of users' lives, from responding to messages, managing calendars and navigating with maps, to helping them be more fit. And in some cases, the heart rate sensor has even helped save lives. We're really excited about the first year with Apple Watch. We have learned a lot, and we believe it has an exciting future head. We announced some fantastic new products during the March quarter. IPhone SE became available on March 31, so none of its sales were reflected in our second quarter results. But so far this quarter we're seeing terrific customer response. IPhone SE is the most powerful four-inch phone ever, and it's a great option for customers all over the world who want a compact phone with advanced features and a great price without compromising performance. Demand has been very strong and exceeds supply at this point, but we're working hard to get the iPhone SE into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible. The addition of the iPhone SE in the iPhone lineup places us in a better strategic position to attract even more customers into our ecosystem. We also unveiled the stunning 9.7-inch iPad Pro with cutting-edge performance and our most advanced display yet. The reviews of our new iPad Pros have been great, and we're hearing from customers that the features and capabilities in the new Pros make them both the ultimate upgrade for iPad owners and a great PC replacement. In the June quarter, we expect to see our best iPad revenue compare in over two years. IPad is the best selling, best reviewed, and most used tablet on the market. Customers tell us that they love iPad for its unique mix of portability, capability, and versatility, with over 1 million iPad apps in the App Store to help them work, play, learn, and create. We also announced CareKit, a new software framework that developers can use to help people take a more active role in their health by keeping track of their care plans, monitoring their symptoms and medication, and delivering the insights they need to make smart decisions about their health. We're very excited about the ways iPhone and Apple Watch are helping people lead healthier lives. We believe there's great promise here for the future, and we are very interested in where this can take us. As always, we're contributing to society beyond our products, promoting the use of renewable energy across our facilities and inside our supply chain and developing cutting-edge technologies to revolutionize recycling of the materials we use. We are unwavering in our commitment to protect the security and privacy of our customers and their data, and we're actively promoting inclusion and equality across our business. As we continue through the June quarter, I'd like to remind you that we measure the health of customer demand based on sell-through. Despite ending Q2 within our channel inventory targets, in light of the macroeconomic environment, we plan to lower our channel inventories in the June quarter. This will impact our reported revenue in Q3. Luca will provide more details on this in his commentary. But before I turn over the call to him, I'll summarize by saying that the future of Apple is very bright. Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. We're very excited about bringing together developers for our four major platforms at our Worldwide Developers Conference in June. We are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure, and in our supply chain. We've made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and Services roadmaps, and we're always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent, and strategic fit. Creating value for shareholders by developing great products and services that enrich people's lives will always be our top priority and the key factor driving our investment and capital allocation decisions. As our business continues to generate high levels of free cash flow, we are in the fortunate position to expand our capital return program again this year, as we have done each year since we started the program four years ago. Today we're announcing an extension of the timeframe of the program by four quarters through March of 2018, and we are expanding the total program size from $200 billion to $250 billion. Luca has more details on this announcement and our results for the March quarter. Luca?\nLuca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the March quarter results. Revenue for the quarter landed within our guidance range of $50.6 billion compared to $58 billion in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 13%. As we had expected, our comparisons to last year were influenced by the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. As Tim said, in constant currency, our revenue declined by 9%. On a geographic basis, in Asia, our revenue grew strongly in Japan, but it declined in greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific. However, our business in these two regions is faring better than the numbers might suggest. We had significant channel inventory reductions and currency weakness, which affected our reported revenue for both these segments. In Mainland China, revenue was down 11%, and the decline was 7% in constant currency terms. Keep in mind that we were up against an extremely difficult year-ago compare when our Mainland China revenue grew 81%. We remain very optimistic about the China market over the long term, and we are committed to investing there for the long run. Gross margin was 39.4%, near the high end of our guidance range, thanks to strong cost performance. Operating margin was 27.7% of revenue, and net income was $10.5 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.90, and cash flow from operations was strong at $11.6 billion. For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 51.2 million iPhones in the quarter compared to 61.2 million in the year-ago quarter, a decline of 16%. It was a particularly challenging comparison to the record quarter a year ago, when iPhone sales grew 40%, as we entered last March quarter in supply/demand imbalance, which was recovered during the quarter. Also, this year we reduced channel inventory by 450,000 units while we increased inventory by 1 million units a year ago. We have exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range for channel inventory. iPhone ASP was $642 compared to $659 in the year-ago quarter, with weak international currencies and very popular mid-tier and entry offerings contributing to the difference year over year. iPhone's momentum in business markets continues to be very impressive. A recent survey by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, found that among U.S. corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones. That's the highest June quarter iPhone purchase intent ever measured by the survey and five points higher than a year ago. Turning to Services, we generated $6 billion in revenue, an increase of 20% over the March quarter last year, thanks primarily to the continued strong performance of the App Store, with revenue growing 35% to a new all-time high. According to App Annie, the App Store generated 90% more global revenue than Google Play in the March quarter, up from a 75% lead in 2015. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes Store's, the average amount spent per customer reached a new all-time record in the March quarter. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4 million Macs compared to 4.6 million last year, a decline of 12%. It was a challenging quarter for personal computer sales across the industry, but we believe we gained market share. Despite the overall market slowdown, we generated double-digit Mac growth in a number of markets, including Russia, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and the UAE. And just last week we updated the MacBook, our thinnest and lightest Mac, with the latest processors, faster graphics, faster flash storage, and longer battery life. We think our customers are going to love this update. We ended the quarter within our four-week to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 10.3 million units compared to 12.6 million units in the year-ago quarter. We also reduced channel inventory by about 200,000 units, and we exited the quarter within our five-week to seven-week target range. In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 78% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 72% of the U.S. commercial tablet market, comprising business, government, and education. iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In February, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2. And among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 59% plan to purchase an iPad, more than three times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad, and the June quarter purchase intent of 71%. Revenue from other products grew 30% over last year thanks to Apple Watch. We have expanded distribution to 60 countries and introduced bands in beautiful new colors for spring, so customers can personalize their watches in more ways with a range of colors, styles, and materials. Our customers are very happy with Apple Watch, with 451 Research measuring 94% customer satisfaction. We're also making great progress with our enterprise initiatives. IBM now has engagements for more than 200 deployments of native iOS apps for large enterprise customers to accelerate mobile transformation. Our Mobility Partner program also continues to grow, with 108 partners across 20 countries. We see continued broad industry adoption of native iOS apps to transform how professionals do their work and serve their customers. For example, retail bankers are using iOS apps on iPads to greet and onboard customers, reduce queue times, and improve the customer experience. And in hospitals, doctors and nurses are using iOS apps on iPhone and iPad to share and communicate more effectively so that they can spend more time with patients and less time on administrative tasks. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $232.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $17.2 billion. $208.9 billion of this cash, or 90% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $15.5 billion in U.S. dollar denominated notes during the quarter, including our first green bond tranche to fund initiatives such as renewable energy and environmental design projects. We exited the March quarter with $72 billion in term debt. We returned $10 billion to investors during the quarter, including $2.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $7 billion on repurchases of 71.8 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We have now completed over $163 billion of the current $200 billion capital return program, including $117 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we are announcing the latest update to our program, which we are increasing to a total of $250 billion. Once again, we're allocating the majority of the expansion of the program to share repurchases. Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, the board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $140 billion level to $175 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employee restricted stock units. We also know that the dividend is very important to many of our investors who value income, and we are raising it for the fourth time in less than four years. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.52 per share to $0.57 per share, an increase of about 10%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today and is payable on May 12, 2016 to shareholders of record as of May 9, 2016. We continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. With $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $87 billion to our investors, which represents about 15% of our market cap at the current stock price. As in the past, we expect to fund our capital return program with U.S. cash, future U.S. cash flow generation, and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly and solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This allows us to be thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of the program. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $41 billion and $43 billion. The revenue guidance implies a year-over-year decline as we lap an incredibly strong June quarter last year where revenue grew 33%, due in part to accelerated iPhone upgrade purchases. This tough compare is compounded by the continued weak macro environment this year and the strong U.S. dollar, which affects our revenue growth in international markets. Embedded in this guidance is a planned channel inventory reduction worth over $2 billion, as we have elected to be prudent about our channel inventory position given the current macro environment. The guidance also reflects a range of possible scenarios related to how quickly we can get into supply/demand balance for iPhone SE. Due to these factors, our expected demand is greater than the revenue range implies. Sequentially, our guidance implies a revenue decline of 15% to 19%, which is comparable to the 17% sequential decline that we've averaged from the March to June quarter for the last three years, despite the anticipated channel inventory adjustments I just described. We expect seasonal sequential declines in iPhone and iPad sales and a sequential increase in Mac sales. We also expect iPhone ASPs to decline sequentially as we get farther from the launch of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and as iPhone SE enters the mix. We know that our revenue guidance falls short of market estimates for the third quarter. We believe the difference comes primarily from three areas: first, the $2 billion-plus channel inventory reduction I just mentioned; second, the effect of the channel inventory reduction and the launch of iPhone SE on iPhone ASPs, as well as the current constrained supply of iPhone SE; and third, different estimates for Mac, which we expect to grow sequentially at a rate similar to what we have experienced in the past June quarters. We expect gross margins to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect continued cost improvements to be more than offset by the sequential loss of leverage from lower revenue and a different mix of products. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: First we'll hear with Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thank you so much. My first question was actually just a clarification in terms of putting in context that $2 billion in channel inventory reduction. What was that last year, just to help us make the comparison on a year-over-year basis? And then the bigger question, Tim, was with the smartphone market now reaching a pretty mature growth phase, how does Apple think of itself going forward? Is it as a growth company, or is it a more mature tech company? And if it's still the former, how does that change how you think about M&A, especially given the position you're in with your balance sheet strategically?\nLuca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Simona, let me give you the data points on the sell-through, and then I'll let Tim answer the strategic question. We had a channel inventory reduction that was worth a bit less than $800 million a year ago.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Simona, hi, it's Tim. In terms of do I think the smartphone market is mature, I think that the market, as you know, is currently not growing. However, my view of that is that's an overhang of the macroeconomic environment in many different places in the world. And we're very optimistic that this too shall pass and that the market and particularly us will grow again. The reason that we're optimistic is we look at the three places that iPhone sales come from. And from an upgrade point of view as I mentioned in my comments, we compare favorably, slightly better than the upgrade cycle that we saw on the iPhone 5s. We're lower than the iPhone 6, but I think all of us know that that was an extraordinary cycle that accelerated upgrades from 2016 into 2015. And so that comparable will be tough for this year, but that's a transitory thing. As we look at switchers, we're extremely excited that for the first half we set a record from switchers from other platforms, the largest we've ever seen in any six-month period before, so we've got traction there. And then on emerging markets, if you take a look at India, we grew by 56%, and we're placing increasing emphasis in these areas, where it's clear there will be disproportionate growth versus the more developed areas. The next thing is with the iPhone SE, we have seen our ability to attract even more customers into the platform with an incredible product that is at a new price point for us with the latest technology, and so we're optimistic about attracting even more customers with that. We also look at our pipeline, and we're very excited about what's in our pipeline. And so all of those things make me optimistic. Your other question was on M&A. Regardless of the first, we're always looking in the market about things that could complement things that we do today, become features in something we do, or allow us to accelerate entry into a category that we're excited about. And so as I said before, our test is not on the size. We would definitely buy something larger than we've bought thus far. It's more about the strategic fit and whether it's a great technology and great people. And so we continue to look and we stay very active in the M&A market.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thank you, Simona. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.\nEugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Good afternoon. Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone ASP trends? And specifically, you mentioned that the iPhone SE is going to impact it. But how are you thinking about the aspirational market share that's out there and your actual market share and using price to close that gap? Is it just the iPhone SE, or could there be other iPhone models that will be discounted to try to be more aggressive in emerging markets? And one for Luca, can you talk a little bit about the Services segment in terms of what piece of the services is driving growth, and maybe a little bit about the profitability on a net basis versus a gross basis that you've referred to in the past? Thanks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Gene, I think the iPhone SE is attracting two types of customers. One is customers that wanted the latest technology but wanted it in a more compact package, and we clearly see even more people than we thought in that category. And then secondly, it's attracting people who aspire to own an iPhone but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a new entry. And so I think both of these markets are very, very important to us, and we're really excited about where it can take us. I do think that we will be really happy with the new-to-iPhone customers that we see from here because of the early returns we've had. We are currently supply constrained, but we'll be able to work our way out of this at some point. But it's great to see the overwhelming demand for it. I'll let Luca comment on the ASPs.\nLuca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: So on the ASPs, Gene, we mentioned that we're going to be down sequentially. And this is really the combination of two factors when we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. It's the fact that we are having the iPhone SE entering the mix, and that obviously is going to have a downward pressure on ASP. And also this channel inventory reduction that we've talked about, obviously the channel inventory reduction will come from higher-end models, and that is also affecting the sequential trend on ASPs. The question on Services, when we look at our Services business, it's obviously growing very well across the board. The biggest element and the part of the Services business that is growing very well, we mentioned 35%, is the App Store. It's interesting for us that our Music business, which had been declining for a number of quarters, now that we have both a download model and a streaming model, we have now hit an inflection point. And we really believe that this will be the bottom and we can start growing from there over time. We have many other Services businesses that are doing very well. We have an iCloud business that is growing very quickly, faster than the App Store from a much lower base, but I think it's important for us as we continue to develop these businesses. Tim has talked about Apple Pay. It doesn't provide a meaningful financial contribution at this point, but as we look at the amount of transactions that are going through Apple Pay right now and we think ahead for the long term, that could be an interesting business for us as well. From a profitability standpoint, we had mentioned last time that when you look at it on a gross basis, so in terms of purchase value of these services, the profitability of the business is similar to company average. Of course, when you net out the amount that is paid to developers and you look at it in terms of what is reported in our P&L, obviously that business has a profitability that is higher than company average. We don't get into the specifics of specific products or services, but it's very clear it's significantly higher than company average.\nEugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. First for Luca, this is the worst gross margin guide in a year and a half or so. And over the last couple of quarters, you've talked about a number of tailwinds, including component cost, the lower accounting deferrals that went into effect in September. You just mentioned the Services margins are above corporate average. So the question is, are some of those tailwinds winding down, or is the significant guide down in gross margins for the June quarter entirely related to volume and the iPhone 5 SE? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.\nLuca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Katy, clearly the commodity environment remains quite favorable, and we continue to expect cost improvements. The other dynamics that you've mentioned are still there. Obviously, what is different and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we will have lots of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins. And the other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products. And particularly when you look at iPhone, what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I think we've got a couple of things that are affecting not only ASPs, but obviously they also affect margins. And it's the fact that we had a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range. And so when you take into account those factors, those are the big elements that drive our guidance range right now.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you, and then a question for Tim. I appreciate the optimism around longer-term iPhone unit growth, but with developed market penetration in the \u2013 anywhere from 60% to 80%, the growth is going to have to come from new markets. You've talked about India. Can you just spend a little bit more time on that market? What are some of the hurdles you have to overcome for that to be a larger part of the business? When should we expect Apple to have more distribution and specifically your own stores in that country? Thanks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Katy, in the short term, let me just make a couple of comments on the developed markets just to make sure this is clear. If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%. And so when you think about upgrade cycles, upgrade cycles would have varying rates on it. As I talked about it in the comments, the iPhone 6s upgrade rate is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s but lower than the iPhone 6. But the other multiplier in that equation is obviously the size of the installed base. And so the nut of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off. And it's our jobs to come up with great products that people desire, and also to continue to attract over Android switchers. With our worldwide share, there's still quite a bit of room in the developed markets as well. And from an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back perhaps but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really began this year, and so we'll begin to see some really good networks coming on in India. That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone in a way that an older network, a 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. And so the infrastructure is one key. The second one is building the channel out. Unlike the U.S., as an example, where the carriers in the U.S. sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the United States, in India the carriers in general sell virtually no phones. And so it's out in retail, and retail is many, many different small shops. And so we've been in the process \u2013 it's not something that we just started in the last few weeks. We've been working in India now for a couple of years or more, but we've been working with great energy over the last 18 months or so, and I'm encouraged by the results that we're beginning to see there, and believe there's a lot, lot more there. It is already the third largest smartphone market in the world. But because the smartphones that are working there are low end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there. But I view India as where China was maybe seven to ten years ago from that point of view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nA.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. I have one and then a follow-up as well. My sense is that you talked about adjusting for the changes in channel inventory, that you're guiding for relatively normal sequential growth. And I think if you do the math, it's probably the same or perhaps a touch worse in terms of iPhone unit growth sequentially relative to normal seasonality between fiscal Q2 and Q3. I guess the question is, given that you should be entering new markets and you should see pronounced elasticity from the iPhone SE device, why wouldn't we be seeing something that was dramatically above normal seasonal in terms of iPhone revenues and units for this quarter? Maybe you could push back on me, but I can't help thinking that when Apple introduced the iPad mini in a similar move to move down-market, there was great growth for one quarter, and the iPad never grew again, and margins and ASPs went down. And it looks like you're introducing the SE, and at least on a sequential basis, you're not calling for any uplift even adjusting for channel inventory. And ASPs I presume will go down and certainly it's impacting gross margins, as you've guided to. So could you respond to, A), why you're not seeing the elasticity? And, B), is the analogy with the iPad mini completely misplaced?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Toni, it's Tim. Let me see if I can address your question. The channel inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone, and so that would affect the unit compare that you may be thinking about. The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it. It is clear that there is a demand there even much beyond what we thought. And so that is really why we have the constraint that we have. And so do I think it will be like the iPad mini? No, I don't think so. I don't see that. I think that the tablet market in general, one of the challenges with the tablet market is that the replacement cycle is materially different than in the smartphone market. And so as you probably know, we haven't had an issue in customer satisfaction on the iPad. It's incredibly high. And we haven't had an issue with usage of the iPad. The usage is incredibly high. But the consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for a very long period of time before an upgrade. We continue to be very optimistic on the iPad business. And as I had said in my remarks, we believe we're going to have the best compare for iPad revenue this quarter that we have had in quite some time. And so we'll report back in July on that one. But I think iPhone has a particularly different kind of cycle to it than the tablet market.\nA.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And if I can follow up, Tim, you alluded to replacement cycles and differences between the iPad and the iPhone. My sense was when you were going through the iPhone 6 cycle was that you had commented that the upgrade cycle was not materially different. I think your characterization was that it accelerated a bit in the U.S. but international had grown to be a bigger part of your business, and replacement cycles there were typically a little bit longer. And so I'm wondering. If there was only a modest difference between the iPhone 5s and the iPhone 6, how big a difference are we really seeing in terms of replacement cycles across the last three generations? And maybe you can help us. If the replacement cycle was flat this year relative to what you saw last year, how different would your results have been this quarter and the first half?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's a lot there. Let me just say I don't recall saying the things that you said I said about the upgrade cycle. Let me get that out of the way. Now let me describe without the specific numbers. The iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we've measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6. I don't mean just a hair lower. It's a lot lower. And so without giving you exact numbers, if we would have the same rate on iPhone 6s that we did iPhone 6, it would be time for a huge party. It would be a huge difference. Now the good news is \u2013 the great news from my point of view is I think we're strategically positioned very well because we've announced the iPhone SE. We are attracting customers that we previously didn't attract. That's really great. And this tough compare eventually isn't the benchmark. And the installed base is up 80% over the last two years. And so all of those I think bode well. And the switcher comments I made earlier, I wouldn't underestimate that because that's very important for us in every geography. So thanks for the question.\nA.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thanks, Toni. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Cross Research Group, we'll hear from Shannon Cross.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much. I have a couple questions. One, Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China? I know the Greater China revenue I think was down 26%. You did talk about Mainland China. But just if you could, talk about some of the trends you're seeing there and how you think it's playing out, and maybe your thoughts on iPhone SE adoption within China as well.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Shannon, thanks for the question. If you take Greater China, we include Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China in the Greater China segment that you see reported on your data sheet. The vast majority of the weakness in the Greater China region sits in Hong Kong. And our perspective on that is it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the U.S. dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the U.S. dollar. And that has driven tourism, international shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago. If you look at Mainland China, which is one that I am personally very focused on, we are down 11% in Mainland China on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, we're only down 7%. And the way that we really look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell-through. And if you look at it there, we were down 5%. And keep in mind that that's down 5% on a comp a year ago that was up 81%. And so as I back up from this and look at the larger picture, I think China is not weak as has been talked about. I see China as may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it. And so we remain really optimistic on China. We opened seven stores there during the quarter. We now are at 35. We'll open five more this quarter to achieve 40, which we had talked about before. And the LTE adoption continues to rise there, but it's got a long way ahead of it. And so we continue to be really optimistic about it and just would ask folks to look underneath the numbers at the details of them before concluding anything. Thanks for the question.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Okay, thanks. And then my second question is with regard to OpEx leverage or thinking about when I look at the revenue, your revenue is below our expectations, but OpEx is pretty much in line. So how are you thinking about potential for leverage, I don't know, cost containment maybe when macro is bad and revenue is under pressure? And how are you juggling that versus the required investment you need to go forward?\nLuca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Shannon, it's Luca. Of course we think about it. We think about it a lot. And so when you look at our results, for example, our OpEx for the quarter, for the March quarter was up 10%, which is the lowest rate that you've seen in years. And when you look within OpEx, you actually see two different dynamics. You see continued significant investments in research and development because we really believe that's the future of the company. We continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of revenue. We have a much broader portfolio than we used to have. We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make. And so that part we really need to protect and we want to continue to invest in the business. And then when you look at our SG&A portion of OpEx for the March quarter, it was actually down slightly. So obviously, we think about it, and of course we look at our revenue trend and we take measures accordingly. And when you look at the guidance that we provided for the June quarter, that 10% year-over-year increase that I mentioned to you for the March quarter goes down to a range of 7% to 9% up. And again, the focus is on making investments in R&D and continuing to run SG&A extremely tightly and in a very disciplined way. As you know, our E-to-R, expense-to-revenue ratio, is around 10%. It's something that we're very proud of. It's a number that is incredibly competitive in our industry, and we want to continue to keep it that way. At the same time, we don't want to underinvest in the business.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Than you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From UBS, we'll hear from Steve Milunovich.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Tim, I first wanted to ask you about Services, and how do you view Services? You've obviously highlighted it the last two quarters. Do you view it going forward as a primary driver of earnings, or do you view it \u2013 you mentioned platforms in terms of your operating systems, which I would agree with. And in that scenario, I would argue it's more a supporter of the ecosystem and a supporter of the hardware margins over time and therefore somewhat subservient to hardware. So it's great that it's growing, but longer term, I would view its role as more creating ecosystem that supports the high margins on hardware as opposed to independently driving earnings. How do you think about it?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The most important thing for us, Steve, is that we want to have a great customer experience. So overwhelmingly, the thing that drives us are to embark on services that help that and become a part of the ecosystem. The reality is that in doing so, we have developed a very large and profitable business in the Services area. And so we felt last quarter and working up to that that we should pull back the curtain so that people could \u2013 our investors could see the Services business both in terms of the scale of it and the growth of it. As we said earlier, the purchase value of the installed base services grew by 27% during the quarter, which was an acceleration over the previous quarter. And the value of it hit just \u2013 or was just shy of $10 billion. And so it's huge, and we felt it was important to spell that out.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then going back to the upgrades of the installed base, you clearly mentioned that you've pulled forward some demand, which makes sense. But there does seem to be a lengthening of the upgrade cycle, particularly in the U.S. AT&T and Verizon have talked about that. Investors I think perceive that maybe the marginal improvements on the phone might be less currently and could be less going forward. At the same time, I think you just announced that you can get the upgrade program online, which I guess potentially could shorten it. Do you believe that upgrade cycles are currently lengthening and can continue to do so?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: What we've seen is that it depends on what you compare it to. If you compare to the iPhone 5s, what we're seeing is the upgrade rate today is slightly higher or that there are more people upgrading, if you will, in a similar time period in terms of rate than the iPhone 5s. But if you compare to iPhone 6, you would clearly arrive at the opposite conclusion. And so I think it depends on people's reference points. And we thought it very important in this call to be very clear and transparent about what we are seeing. And so I think in retrospect, you can look at it and say, well maybe the appropriate measure is more to the iPhone 5s, and I think everybody intuitively thought that the upgrades were accelerated with the iPhone 6. In retrospect, when you look at the periods, they clearly were.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thanks, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan.\nRod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thanks, guys, for fitting me in. I wanted to start with a more general question. I guess. Tim, this one is aimed at you. As you think about where you thought things were going to head last quarter when you reported to us and how it's changed this quarter, obviously this kind of a disappointing demand environment. Can you just help us understand what maybe the top two or three things are that have changed, so as we walk away from this we understand what the differences are and what the direction of change is? And I've got a follow up.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think, Rod, you're probably indirectly asking about our trough comment, if you will, from last quarter. And when we made that, we did not contemplate or comprehend that we were going to make a $2 billion-plus reduction in channel inventory during this quarter. And so if you factor that in and look at true customer demand, which is the way that we look at it internally, I think you'll find a much more reasonable comparison.\nRod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask you about the tax situation a little bit. Treasury obviously has made some rule changes, and I wonder maybe if, Luca, you could comment on what the impact to Apple from those is, if anything; and, Tim, maybe more broadly, how you guys see the tax situation for Apple looking forward? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes. Rod, these are new regulations. We are in the process of assessing them. Frankly, from first read, we don't anticipate that they're going to have any material impact on our tax situation. Some of them relate to inversion transactions, so obviously that's not an issue for us. Some of them are around internal debt financing, which is not something that we use, so we don't expect any issue there. As you know, we are the largest U.S. taxpayer by a wide margin, and we already pay full U.S. tax on all the profits from the sales that we make in the United States. So we don't expect them to have any impact on us. On tax reform, maybe I can continue, and I'll let Tim provide more color, but we've been strong advocates for comprehensive corporate tax reform in this country. We continue to do that. We think a reform of the tax code would have significant benefits for the entire U.S. economy, and we remain optimistic that we're going to get to a point where we can see that tax reform enacted. At that point in time, of course, we would have much more flexibility around optimizing our capital structure and around providing more return of capital to our investors.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Chief Executive Officer & Director: The only thing I would add, Rod, is I think there are a growing number of people in both parties that would like to see comprehensive reform, and so I'm optimistic that it will occur. It's just a matter of when. And that's difficult to say, but I think most people do recognize that it's in the U.S.'s interest to do this.\nRod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thanks, guys.\nNancy Paxton - Senior Director, Investor Relations and Treasury: Thank you, Rod.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. Before we begin, we want you to know that in addition to our press release and summary data schedule, we've published some supplemental material that we'll be referring to in our remarks today and you can find a link to this supplemental material on our Investor Relations' website, at apple.com/investor. And it's also included as an exhibit in the Form 8-K we filed with the SEC earlier today.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speaks as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Nancy, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us. Today, we're reporting Apple's strongest financial results ever. We generated all-time record quarterly revenue of $75.9 billion in the December quarter, in line with our expectations and up 2% over last year's blockbuster results. This is a huge accomplishment for our company, especially given the turbulent world around us. In constant currency, our growth rate would have been 8%. Our record revenue and continued strong operating performance also led to an all-time record quarterly net income of $18.4 billion. We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the December quarter, an all-time high. To put that volume into perspective, it's an average of over 34,000 iPhones an hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 13 straight weeks. It's almost 50% more than our Q1 volume just two years ago and more than four times our volume five years ago. 74.8 million iPhones is an incredible number and it speaks to both the immense popularity of iPhone and the phenomenal execution of our teams to deliver a massive number of devices in such a short period of time. Our results are particularly impressive, given the challenging global macroeconomic environment. We're seeing extreme conditions unlike anything we've experienced before just about everywhere we look. Major markets, including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and the eurozone, have been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies. Since the end of fiscal 2014, for instance, the euro and British pound are down double-digits, and major currencies such as the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, and Turkish lira have declined 20% or more. The Brazilian real is down more than 40% and the Russian ruble has declined more than 50%. 66% of Apple's revenue is now generated outside the United States, so foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results. Page one of our supplemental material illustrates this point. $100 of Apple's non-U.S. dollar revenue in Q4 of 2014 translated to only $85 last quarter due to the weakening currencies in our international markets. As you can see, the movement has been dramatic. Last quarter alone, the currency impact has been very large. Page two of our supplemental material illustrates our Q1 revenue and growth rates expressed in constant currency. The 8% growth rate I spoke about earlier translates to $80.8 billion in constant currency revenue, which is $5 billion more than our reported revenue. For perspective, that difference is about the size of the annual revenue of a Fortune 500 company. We know the conditions in China have been a source of concern for many investors. Last summer, while many companies were experiencing weakness in their China-based results, we were seeing just the opposite, with incredible momentum for iPhone, Mac and the App Store, in particular. In the December quarter, despite the turbulent environment, we produced our best results ever in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% over last year, 47% sequentially, and 17% year-over-year in constant currency. These great results were fueled by our highest ever quarterly iPhone sales and record App Store performance. Notwithstanding these record results, we began to see some signs of economic softness in Greater China earlier this month, most notably in Hong Kong. Beyond the short-term volatility, we remain very confident about the long-term potential of the China market and the large opportunities ahead of us and we are maintaining our investment plans. Despite the economic challenges all over the world, Apple remains incredibly strong. We have a very satisfied and loyal customer base. We saw a greater number of switchers from Android to iPhone than ever in Q1, and we are very optimistic about our business over the long-term. Innovation has always been the reason behind our success and we remain committed to making the best products in the world and expanding the Apple experience to change our customer's lives in better and more meaningful ways. We've invested through economic uncertainty in the past and we've always come out stronger on the other side. In fact, some of the most important breakthrough products in Apple's history were born as a result of investing through the downturn. We've also seen these times as opportunities to invest in new markets, just as we're doing now in areas such as India and other emerging markets. Getting back to our record Q1 performance, let me give you some highlights of what we've accomplished since our last quarterly call together. We shipped the amazing new iPad Pro, which has been extremely well received by customers along with a new smart keyboard and revolutionary Apple Pencil. We launched the all-new Apple TV with its own App Store, laying the foundation for the future of television. We had our best quarter by far for Apple TV sales and the number of apps developed for Apple TV is growing rapidly. Today there are over 3,600 apps delivering everything from games to entertainment to educational programming. We expanded distribution of Apple Watch to almost 12,000 locations in 48 countries during the quarter. As we expected, we set a new quarterly record for Apple Watch sales, with especially strong sales in the month of December. We released OS X El Capitan, refining the experience and improving performance for our Mac customers. We also updated the entire iMac family with stunning new retina displays and introduced a new line up of wireless accessories. We launched Apple Pay in Canada and Australia with American Express and announced plans to bring this amazingly convenient, private, and secure mobile payment experience to China, Hong Kong, Spain and Singapore in the coming year. Consumers have spent billions of dollars with Apple Pay. In the second half of 2015, we saw a significant acceleration in usage, with a growth rate 10 times higher than in the first half of the year. There are now over 5 million contactless payment ready locations in the countries where Apple Pay is live today and it's soon to be accepted at thousands of Exxon and Mobil branded stations across the U.S. via their Speedpass+ app. Finally, we also shared the incredible Apple Music experience with even more listeners, with over 10 million paying subscribers less than four months since customers began paying for the service. Our financial position has never been stronger. We had the mother of all balance sheets, with almost $216 billion in cash, which translates to nearly $39 per diluted share of Apple stock. We continue to invest confidently in our future and we also continue to return capital to our shareholders at a rapid pace. Our investors have been asking for a while about the recurring nature of our business. Especially during a period of economic uncertainty, we believe it is important to appreciate that a significant portion of Apple's revenue recurs over time. First and foremost, our customer satisfaction and retention rates are second to none and provide us with a long lasting foundation. For example, recent consumer surveys by 451 Research, formerly known as ChangeWave, measured an incredible 99% customer satisfaction rate for iPhone 6S and 6S Plus and an equally impressive 97% rate for the iPad Air 2. They also indicate that our iPhone loyalty rate is almost twice as strong as the next highest brand. In addition, a growing portion of our revenue is directly driven by our existing install base. Because our customers are very satisfied and engaged, they spend a lot of time on their devices and purchase apps, content, and other services. They also are very likely to buy other Apple products or replace the one that they own. And because of the enduring value of the device, their replacing is likely higher to be given or sold to someone who will also love and use it often. So, as a result, our install base has been growing very fast and has recently reached a major milestone, crossing 1 billion active devices for the first time. This is an unbelievable asset for us. Because our install base has grown quickly, we have also seen an acceleration in the growth of our services business, another large and important source of recurring revenues. Now that we have reached this milestone of 1 billion active devices, we felt this would be a great opportunity to share more information on what has become one of the largest service businesses in the world. So now, I'd like to turn the call to Luca, who will provide more insight into how our platform has grown, followed by details on our record quarterly results.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Each quarter, we report results for our Services category, which includes revenue from iTunes, the App Store, AppleCare, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and some other items. Today, we would like to highlight the major drivers of growth in this category, which we have summarized on page three of our supplemental material. The vast majority of the services we provide to our customers, for instance, apps, movies and TV shows, are tied to our installed base of devices, rather than to current quarter sales. For some of these services, such as content, we recognize revenue based on transaction value. For some of the services, such as the App Store, we share a portion of the value of each transaction with the app developer and only recognize revenue on the portion that we keep. To fully comprehend the scale of the services that we are delivering to our installed base and how fast this business is growing, we look at purchases in addition to revenue. When we aggregate the purchase value of services tied to our installed base during fiscal 2015, it adds up to more than $31 billion. That's an increase of 23% over fiscal 2014. In the recent December quarter, purchases of installed base services reached $8.9 billion, which is a growth rate of 24% year-over-year. The size and growth of these services tied to our installed base compare favorably to other services companies you're familiar with. Our installed base services are also quite profitable, with gross margins that, on a purchase value basis, are similar to our company average. Also, we're very excited by the scale and growth of our active installed base, as we indicate on page four. We define an active device as one that has been engaged with our services within the past 90 days. Our active installed base has recently past 1 billion devices with year-over-year growth of more than 25%. Apple is in a unique position of strength. We have world class scales in hardware, software and services all under one roof, which lets us innovate in ways that other companies can't. We have built a huge installed base around four platforms, iOS, Mac OS, watchOS and tvOS. We have tremendously satisfied and loyal customers who are engaged with our services at a fast growing rate. All of this provides us with an unparalleled foundation for the future of Apple business. Let me now turn to the details of our record breaking December quarter. As Tim said, revenue was $75.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 2% year-over-year. Our growth was driven by all-time record iPhone sales, all-time record revenue from services, the expanded availability of Apple Watch, and the successful launch of the new Apple TV. We achieved this record revenue performance despite a very large negative impact from the weakness of foreign currency and in constant currency; our revenue growth rate was 8%. We once again achieved very impressive results in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% year-over-year and 47% sequentially to an all-time record of $18.4 billion. Emerging markets performance was strong overall, up 11% year-over-year and representing 34% of total company revenue for the quarter. Company gross margin was 40.1%, up sequentially and better than our expectations, mainly due to favorable commodity costs and product mix. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue and net income was $18.4 billion, a new all-time record. Diluted earnings per share was $3.28, a 7% year-over-year increase over our previous all-time record and cash flow from operations was very strong, at $27.5 billion. For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 74.8 million iPhones in the quarter, an increase of 300,000 compared to last December quarter's sensational results. Total iPhone sales grew 76% in India and more than 45% in Korea, Middle East and Africa. Sales were also up 20% or more in many western European countries and grew 18% in Mainland China. iPhone ASP was $691 compared to $687 in the year ago quarter, in spite of a very unfavorable foreign exchange impact. We continue to see very strong interest in iPhone not only with consumers but also with business users. Among corporate buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 451 Research found that 79% planned to purchase iPhones. That is the highest iPhone purchase intent in the eight-year history of the survey. We started the quarter below our channel inventory target range and thanks to an extremely successful manufacturing ramp; we were able to exit the quarter slightly above the low end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.3 million Macs compared to 5.5 million last year, a decline of 4%. We continued our long running trend of PC market share gains, based on IDC's latest estimate of an 11% global market contraction, and we were especially happy with 27% year-over-year Mac sales growth in Mainland China. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 16.1 million, compared to 21.4 million in the year ago quarter, and we exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range of iPad channel inventory. In the segments of the tablet market where we compete, we continue to be highly successful. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad has 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And the latest data published by IDC indicates that iPad accounts for 67% of the U.S. commercial tablet market comprising enterprise, government, and education. iPad customer metrics are also extremely positive. In November, 451 Research measured a 97% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Air 2 and among consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 65% plan to purchase an iPad. Corporate buyers reported a 95% satisfaction rate for iPad and a March quarter purchase intent of 73%. Our enterprise initiatives continue to expand. IBM released 48 new IBM MobileFirst for iOS apps in the December quarter and there are now over 100 apps in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS catalog for iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Our partnership with Cisco has gained significant momentum since we announced it at the end of August. Our engineering teams are on track to deliver exciting new capabilities that create a fast lane for iOS business users by optimizing Cisco networks for iOS devices and apps, integrate iPhone with Cisco enterprise environments and provide unique collaboration opportunities on iPhone and iPad. We are also continuing to grow our mobility partner program. We added more than 25 partners in the December quarter, bringing the total to over 90. One great example of our progress in the enterprise is Eli Lilly, who boosted sales productivity by equipping 15,000 field based personnel across the world with iPad. A leader in mobile technology, Lilly has eliminated laptops in the field and is upgrading its U.S. field sales teams to iPad Pro. Turning to services, we generated almost $6.1 billion in revenue, including $548 million we received from a patent infringement dispute. Excluding that amount, our services revenue was $5.5 billion, a new all-time record and an increase of 15% over last year, thanks in large part to strong growth from apps. Revenue from the App Store increased 27% and the number of transacting customers grew 18%, also setting an all-time record. Among our customers who purchased apps and content from our iTunes stores, the average amount spent per customer reached an all-time high in the December quarter. Revenue from other products grew strongly, up 62% over last year, thanks to the growing contribution from Apple Watch, as well as the successful launch of the new Apple TV, both of which established new all-time quarterly records. We expanded Apple Watch distribution significantly over the course of the quarter and we experienced especially strong results during the holiday buying season. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $215.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.1 billion. $200 billion of this cash or 93% of the total was outside the United States. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents and we spent $3 billion to repurchase 26 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched our sixth accelerated share repurchase program, spending $3 billion and receiving an initial delivery of 20.4 million shares. We have now completed over $153 billion of our $200 billion program, including $110 billion in share repurchases. As we have done in the past, we plan to provide an update on our capital return program when we report our second quarter results in April. We also plan to be very active in the U.S. and international debt markets in 2016, in order to fund our capital return activities. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.52 per share of common stock payable on February 11, 2016, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2016. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $50 billion and $53 billion. We are providing a wider range for revenue than usual for the second quarter because of the volatility we are seeing in the economy and in the financial and currency markets. We expect gross margin to be between 39% and 39.5%. We believe these are extremely strong margins in light of the headwinds we face from foreign exchange and the sequential loss of leverage. We expect OpEx to be between $6 billion and $6.1 billion, we expect OI&E to be about $325 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. As you know, we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter and it's difficult for us to forecast economic and foreign exchange factors; however, at this point, we believe the March quarter faces the most difficult year-over-year compare relative to the rest of the year. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.\nSimona Jankowski: Hi, thank you very much. Just in terms of your March quarter guidance, it does imply a double-digit decline at the midpoint. Maybe if you can just clarify, first of all, what FX headwind is embedded in that? And then just going to the fundamental underpinning reasons for that, how much of it do you think has to do with international markets in terms of weakening demand and how much of that do you think is comps versus any other factors you might identify, such as a response to higher prices for the iPhone in certain overseas markets?\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Simona. Let me take this one. In constant currency, when you look at it for the March quarter, revenue would be down between 5% and 10%. So, we are looking at a 400 basis point impact from foreign exchange for the March quarter. You talked about a number of issues that are, in fact, included in this guidance. In addition to lapping, of course, a very strong year ago quarter -- just remind you that revenue growth a year ago was up 27%, there's a number of things that we're facing. The macroeconomic environment is weakening. When you think about all the -- particularly all the commodity-driven economies, Brazil and Russia and emerging markets, but also Canada, Australia in developed markets, clearly the economy is significantly weaker than a year ago. We talked about the unfavorable FX, which again is 400 basis points. One of the things that we've done to respond to the foreign exchange situation has been to increase the price of some of our products in certain international markets. That has had the effect of protecting our margins, which you've seen have been very strong, both in the December quarter and in the guidance that we provide for the March quarter. But inevitably over time, higher prices affect demand and so we're capturing that in our guidance. So, I would say these are the major reasons and the drivers for the guidance on revenue.\nSimona Jankowski: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: And next from Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.\nGene Munster: Good afternoon. Tim, could you talk a little bit about the iPhone upgrade program and the theme of iPhone as a subscription? In particular, do you believe that this could have a measurable impact on the December quarter once we anniversary this? And then any thoughts on rolled outside the U.S. when that program would. And I guess my follow-up question would be I know you can't talk about new products, but any high level thoughts on the virtual reality theme. Do you think this is more of a geeky niche or something that could go mainstream?\nTim Cook: On your first question about iPhone, I think the most important thing, Gene, as you know for us, will always be the product and the experience. And so that's first and foremost. Secondly, I would say we were blown away by the level of Android switchers that we had last quarter. It was the highest ever by far. And so we see that as a huge opportunity. Thirdly, the markets, sort of the emerging markets broader than BRIC, but including all of emerging, when I look at our share in these markets and the LTE penetration, I see huge opportunities. In terms of the upgrade program itself, I think over time, it will be meaningful as customers get into a different pattern. How much of that plays out in the Q1 of 2017 range is difficult to say. My own sense would be that the other items I've mentioned are probably more important but I am optimistic about the upgrade program as well.\nGene Munster: And then virtual reality?\nTim Cook: Yeah. In terms of virtual reality, no, I don't think it's a niche. I think it can be -- it's really cool and has some interesting applications.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Gene.\nGene Munster: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Morgan Stanley, Katy Huberty.\nKaty Huberty: Yes, thanks. I appreciate the macro comments as it relates to guidance, but can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking consumers might react from an ASP perspective? Do you expect consumers to move down the product line, given the macro environment? And then also, how is channel inventory influencing guidance? Do you feel like channel inventory needs to come down, given the demand trends? And then I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Couple of points here, Katy. Our iPhone ASP was $691 during the December quarter. We couldn't be happier with the level of ASP that we generated in the December quarter. Keep in mind that the foreign exchange impact on that number was $49. So, obviously, the mix of products was very strong. We had great reception for the new iPhones that we launched at the end of September. Of course, we have a very strong mid-tier this year in the portfolio, with 6 and 6 Plus. But overall, when you look at the outcome during the December quarter, it was very, very strong. So, we feel very good about that and we feel that we have a very, very strong portfolio for iPhone. On the question around channel inventory, we entered the quarter, the December quarter -- and we mentioned it back in October below our target range of five to seven weeks. We have built a bit of inventory during the course of the December quarter. But we have exited at the low end of the five to seven weeks. So, we feel that we are in good shape there. And we've exited the quarter also on iPad and Mac well within the ranges that we want to have.\nKaty Huberty: And then as a follow-up, back in October you guided fiscal 2016 CapEx up over 30%. What's driving that growth? Can you sort of rank it between equipment purchases, data center, and real estate? And given the slowdown that you started to see in December, are you still comfortable with that level of investment growth? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So that is kind of the ranking, Katy. It starts always for us with our tooling and manufacturing process equipment and that is up a bit year-over-year. Then we've got data centers and data centers is a growing expenditure for us, because, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our installed base of customers and devices is growing, and is growing very significantly. And the data center capacity that we put in place is to provide the services that are tied to the installed base. So, that type of expenditure goes together with the installed base. And then around facilities, you probably know that we are nearing completion of our new campus here in Cupertino, and so this is the year where we've got our peak requirements in terms of capital.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Bernstein, we'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I have a question, a follow-up, please. To start, just on iPhones, it looks like your guidance implies about a 15% to 20% unit decline in iPhones for fiscal Q2, which I think, unless you really see a change in demand profile in the second half, suggests that iPhone units will decline year-over-year for fiscal 2016. And I'd like you to address that question, because the obvious follow-up questions are is that because you believe the smartphone market won't grow or because Apple may be reaching saturation in the market? Is that because Apple's replacement cycle accelerated last year and is decelerating this year and that's why we'll see a decline in units? Or is there something about Apple's ability to gain share in a market where the market is moving to much lower price points? But I'm wondering, and Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely to be a decline in iPhone units and how we put that in the context of how we should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you highlighted.\nTim Cook: Toni, we do think that iPhone units will decline in the quarter. We don't think that they will decline to the levels that you're talking about. We aren't projecting beyond the quarter, as Luca mentioned earlier. But at this point in time, we see that Q2 is the toughest compare. We believe it's the toughest compare because of the year ago quarter also had catch up in it from Q1. If you recall, we were heavily supply constrained throughout the whole of Q1 and so some of that demand moved into Q2. Plus we're in an environment now that is dramatically different from a macroeconomic point of view than last Q2, from a currency point of view, from the level of which we've had to adjust pricing in several of these markets, and sort pf the overall [Indiscernible] in virtually every country in the world. And so it's really all of those factors that play in there and it's difficult to sort out how much is due to which one.\nToni Sacconaghi: Right. I mean can you speak to any of the points around your expectation for the smartphone market or whether you think your replacement cycle has changed or whether your ability to gain share has changed?\nTim Cook: The market itself, we don't spend a lot of time on predicting. Our view has always been that if we do -- if we make a great product and have a great experience that we ought to be able to convince enough people to move over. And so as I look at sort of your -- maybe your broader umbrella point about a question on saturation, the metrics I see would strongly suggest otherwise. For example, almost half of the iPhones that we sold in China last quarter were to people who were buying their first iPhone. And certainly if you go outside of China into the other emerging markets, our share is much lower and the LTE penetration is so low, I mean in some cases, it's zero, that it indicates to me that there's still a lot of people, a tremendous number of people in the world, that will buy smartphones and we ought to be able to win over our fair share of those.\nToni Sacconaghi: Okay. And I just have clarifications; I don't really have a follow-up question. Luca you had talked about channel inventory increasing, it was 18.4 million for iPhone last quarter. Can you tell us how many more units you had this quarter? And then I'm not sure if I misheard you, but I think you said your total installed base grew 25% year-over-year. Can you confirm that? Because if services grew at 13% and your installed base grew at 25%, it almost implies your penetration of your installed base, in terms of your ability to sell services, is going down.\nLuca Maestri: So, -- maybe I'm going to start with services, Toni. The reason why we added this -- I think it's page three of our supplemental material, is to try and explain that a couple of steps. The first one is that of the services that we report, there's a portion, about 85% of all of the services that we report is directly tied to the installed base. There is a smaller portion of our services business that is not related to installed base and more related to when we sell a device. A perfect example would be an Apple Care agreement that you purchase at the time of the sale of the device. And then we are showing that on that portion of installed base driven services business, there is a part that is related to -- where we recognize revenue in terms of the full transaction value. And then there are transactions, like for example, App Store sales, where a portion of the transaction does not get recognized by Apple, but it goes to the developer. So, when you look at it from a purchase value standpoint, actually in the December quarter, we grew 24%, and for the fiscal 2015, we grew at 23%. So, we are growing at very, very healthy levels okay. And to reconfirm the growth of the installed base, yes, it was over 25%. To the question around the channel inventory for iPhone, we grew channel inventory by 3.3 million units during the course of the December quarter. Keep in mind; we started in acquisition where we were below our targeted range. We were significantly short at the beginning of the quarter.\nToni Sacconaghi: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I had a question about gross margin. Luca, you got gross margins of 39% to 39.5% in your guidance and that includes hedging. So, I'm curious about the puts or takes in there. And then can you clarify if within the gross margin this quarter that had the IP licensing contribution, as well? Any color you can give, both on this quarter's gross margin puts and takes, and then also the March quarter. And then I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So, -- certainly Shannon, let me start with Q1. I think when you say IP licensing; you mean this patent dispute that was resolved. Yes, it was included in the gross margins and it was worth 40 basis points in the 40.1% that we reported for Q1. For the second quarter, the puts and takes are actually quite simple. From an FX standpoint, the negative impact on a sequential basis from the December quarter is 50 basis points. Then of course, I would say by far the largest impact on margins for the quarter is the loss of leverage, because that's part of our seasonal pattern, which gets offset by a favorable commodity environment that we've seen for a number of quarters now. And in a way, it's the other side of the coin of the foreign exchange situation.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thanks. And then Tim, can you talk a bit about -- and I apologize, I sort of lost my voice here. Can you talk a bit about leverage within the model? I know you said you want to invest while there's great opportunity in China and all of that. But given some of the pressures you're seeing, how do you think about where you spend that incremental SG&A dollar and that R&D dollar? And how should we think about it, given you're running $6 billion a quarter?\nTim Cook: Yeah, on the R&D, Shannon, we're continuing to invest without pause. We have some great things in the pipeline and we very much believe strongly in investing through downturns, such as the one that everyone is going through. In terms of SG&A, we obviously seek to throttle expenditures in SG&A to the business level, with the exception of where we're investing in new stores and, for example, our expansion plans in China have not changed. We are maintaining our investment profile and plans there. We are also continuing to invest in markets where we believe they are great places for Apple for the long-term, like India, as an example of that one. And finally, even in the markets where today, grandly, it looks fairly bleak, from Russia and Brazil and some of the other economies that are very much tied to our oil-based economies. We do believe that this, too, shall pass and that these countries will be great places and we want to serve customers in there and so we're not retrenching. That's not -- we don't believe in that. We fortunately are strong enough to continue investing and we think it's in Apple's best long-term interest to do so. Obviously, from a cost point of view, the downside of economic stress is that some asset prices get cheaper, commodity prices get cheaper, and that sort of thing. And so I think this is exactly the period that you want to invest and do so confidently.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UBS.\nNancy Paxton: Steve, are you there?\nTim Cook: Steve?\nNancy Paxton: Let's go on to the next question please.\nOperator: And we'll hear from Brian White with Drexel.\nBrian White: Tim, could you talk a little bit about the next leg of growth in China? Obviously, Apple has done a phenomenal job there, but where do we see the next leg coming from? And also, you mentioned investing in India. Where do you see that over the next two to three years? I think there's 1 billion mobile subscribers there, almost the size of China. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah. Brian, good question. In terms of China, the LTE penetration as of the end of last October, which is the last data I've got, was in the mid-20s. And so there's an enormous upgrade cycle there for people that are still running on 3G handsets. Also, I've talked about this before, but I think it's worth mentioning again, because it's easy to lose perspective with some of the things you read every day, is that the middle-class in China was less than 50 million people in 2010, and by 2020, it's projected to be about half a billion. And so there's just an enormous number of people moving into the middle-class. And we think this provides us a great opportunity to win over some of those customers into the Apple ecosystem. And so I think the demographics are great. We're continuing to invest in retail stores. Angela and her team have been on this very aggressive rollout plan. We now have 28 stores in Greater China and we're on target to have 40 in the summertime of this year. And so we're continuing on distribution. Obviously, we've got product things in mind and are crafting our products and services with China heavily in mind. We remain very bullish on China and don't subscribe to the doom and gloom kind of predictions frankly. In India, India is also incredibly exciting. India's growth, as you know, is very good. It's quickly becoming the fastest growing BRIC country. It's the third largest smartphone market in the world, behind China and the United States. The population of India is incredibly young. The median age there is 27. I think of the China age being young, at 36, 37 and so 27 is unbelievable. Almost half the people in India are below 25. And so I see the demographics there also being incredibly great for a consumer brand and for people that really want the best products. And as you know, we've been putting increasingly more energy in India. India revenue for us in Q1 was up 38%. We also had currency issues in India, as everybody else did. Constant currency growth was 48%. And so it's a very rapidly expanding country. And I think the government there is very interested economic reforms and so forth that I think all speak to a really good business environment for the future.\nBrian White: Okay, great. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.\nKulbinder Garcha: Thank you. My question's for Tim on the iPhone business. You talk a lot about the macroeconomic weakness weighing on units, but is some of the issue just that last year replacement got accelerated and this year it's kind of normalizing, and that's kind of a one-time headwind in terms of the unit growth that you see in that business. Is any of that going on, or is that not material, in your view? And the other follow-up I had was that you've mentioned in recent calls, helpfully, the percent of the base, prior to when the 6 came out, that were now on the larger screen phones. Can you give us an update on what that number is? I think the last time it was in the low 30s. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yeah. So, last question first. The number of people who had an iPhone prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus announcements -- and so this was in September of 2014 that have not yet upgraded to a 6, 6 Plus or 6s or 6s Plus is now 60%. So, another way to think about that is 40% have, 60% have not. In terms of your initial question about is there some of the compare issue that are people that ran out quickly to buy a 6 and 6 Plus and sort of accelerated? There is no doubt that we had a unbelievable year last year and the Q2 was particularly really, really strong because of the pent-up demand that left from Q1 in addition to Q2. And so there's no doubt about that. However, I think you can tell from the numbers that Luca is talking about just on the currency side and that's before thinking through the affect that price increases can sometimes have on the business over a period of time, it's clear that the economic piece is large.\nKulbinder Garcha: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Kulbinder. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: And next we'll hear from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Mr. Milunovich, you may want to check your mute button.\nTim Cook: Steve, are you there?\nNancy Paxton: Okay. Let's try the next question please.\nOperator: And we'll hear from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.\nMark Moskowitz: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. A question and a follow-up. As far as the question, Tim, I wanted to get a better sense from you in terms of what is the overarching message of introducing a little more details here around services. Is this really to just reinforce the power of the franchise or the platform at Apple in terms of to really navigate tougher macro times in terms of the higher level recurring revenue, or is it a stepping stone to much more in terms of Apple service, i.e. I think of all the stuff you do on the data center side. Could we eventually have seen, with the help of IBM and Cisco that you eventually move more into the cloud services for the enterprise?\nTim Cook: So, good question. We started breaking out services, as you know, in the beginning of fiscal year 2015. And as that business has grown and as it became clear to us that the investors wanted -- investors and analysts wanted more visibility into that business, we've now elected to break it out and show the full size, scope, growth, and make comments on the profitability of it from a transparency point of view. I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on. In terms of our future plans, I wouldn't want to comment about any particular thing, but obviously, with breaking this out, we wouldn't be breaking it out if it wasn't an area that was very important to us in the future.\nMark Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nMark Moskowitz: And I wanted to follow-up on the upgrade advance program dynamics. Can you talk a little more about what you're seeing in terms of in-store at the Apple Stores? Are you seeing any sort of dislocation in terms of folks who are moving to the upgrade or finance program, are they moving more toward Apple versus maybe the in-store percentage that used to be related to the carriers? In other words, are folks just going with Apple now, instead of the carriers, when they buy their phone, as part of these upgrade programs?\nTim Cook: No, I don't -- honestly, this has nothing to do with wanting to move customers from one person to another. This has to do with wanting to provide customers a very simple way to upgrade. Because we serve a significant number of customers in the Apple Store who want the iPhone when it's new and when it comes out, and so we've designed a program that made it simple and easy to do that. I have no idea over time how the percentage of the sales will vary between carriers and the Apple retail store, but that's not our overriding objective.\nMark Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Mark. We have time for one more question.\nOperator: And your final question will come from Jim Suva with Citi.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. A question for Tim and then a detail follow-up for Luca. Tim, with the macro situation changing, a lot of CEOs view that and their strategy is very different go-to-market strategy, some change the way they go to market, some change their products. In the past, Apple's been very known in always having a premium product. With the slowdown in the macro FX and also GDP revision, is Apple's strategy go-to-market still always at premium product, or is there a need to go to more also a middle market or lower price point to attract more customers? Just because it seems like growing that installed base and services, as you pointed out, really economically could really help out Apple in the long-term. And then the financial question for Luca is on that patent litigation, Luca, when you gave guidance three months ago, did you have a view that that was coming in? And if so, was that included in the guidance or not, or was that post the quarter guidance? And I assume it's all one-time this quarter you recorded it, it's all gross margin, and then we don't cause that to reoccur again going forward. Thank you very much.\nTim Cook: Our strategy is always to make the best products. And that -- for the smartphone market, that we are able to provide though several different price points for our customers. We have the premium part of our line is the 6s and the 6s Plus. We also have a mid-price point, with the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus. And we continue to offer the iPhone 5s in the market and it continues to do quite well. And so we offer all of those and I don't see us deviating from that approach. We always want to offer somebody the -- not -- we don't design to a certain price point. We design a great product and we make it priced at a great value. And today, we're able to offer all three of those different iPhone options.\nLuca Maestri: And Jim, on the patent question, yes, obviously this is a one-off item that affected the December quarter. As I said earlier, it's worth 40 basis points. So, without it, our gross margin would have been 39.7%. It will not repeat going forward. To your question around was it included in the guidance, yes, the probability of receiving the amount was incorporated in the development of the guidance range. If you remember, we guided to 39% to 40%, and that number was included within the range.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much gentlemen.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Jim.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. As we closed the books on a very successful fiscal 2017, I have to say I couldn't be more excited about Apple's future. This was our biggest year ever in most parts of the world with all-time record revenue in the United States, Western Europe, Japan, Korea, the Middle East, Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and Asia. We had particularly strong finish this year, generating our highest September quarter revenue ever as year-over-year growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. Revenue was $52.6 billion, above the high end of our guidance range, and up 12% over last year. We generated revenue growth across all of our product categories and showed all-time record results for our Services business. As we expected, we returned to growth in greater China, with unit growth and market share gains for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. In fact, it was an all-time record quarter for Mac sales in mainland China as well as an all-time high for Services revenue. And revenue from emerging markets outside of greater China was up 40%, with great momentum in India, where revenue doubled year over year. We also had great results in enterprise and education with double digit growth in worldwide customer purchases of iPad and Mac in both markets. Gross margin for the September quarter was at the high end of our guidance range, and thanks to exceptional work by our teams, we generated record fourth quarter earnings per share of $2.07, up 24% from a year ago. iPhone sales exceeded our expectations. In the last week and a half of September, we began shipping iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus to customers in more than 50 countries. They instantly became our two most popular iPhone models and have been every week since then. As we speak, the launch of iPhone X is now underway as stores open across Australia and Asia. iPhone X is packed with innovative new technologies that chart our path for the next decade, technologies like the TrueDepth camera system, Super Retina Display, and A11 Bionic chip with neural engine, which has been in development for years with a focus on deep machine learning. iPhone X enables totally new experiences like unlocking your iPhone with Face ID, taking photos with studio-quality lighting effects, or playing immersive augmented reality games. We can't wait for people to experience our vision of the future. Orders have already been very strong, and we're working to get iPhone X into customers' hands as quickly as possible. Turning to Services. Revenue reached an all-time quarterly record of $8.5 billion in the September quarter. A few quarters ago, we established a goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue of $24 billion by the year 2020, and we are well on our way to meeting that goal. In fiscal 2017, we reached $30 billion, making our Services business already the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're also delighted to report our second consecutive quarter of double-digit unit growth for iPad. Customers have responded very positively to the new iPad lineup. And with the launch of iOS 11, the iPad experience has become more powerful than ever, with great new features for getting things done like the new dock, Files app, drag and drop, multitasking and more power than most PC notebooks. The launch of iOS 11 also made iOS the world's largest platform for augmented reality. There are already over 1,000 apps with powerful AR features in our App Store today, with developers creating amazing new experiences in virtually every category of apps aimed at consumers, students and business users alike. Put simply, we believe AR is going to change the way we use technology forever. We're already seeing things that will transform the way you work, play, connect and learn. For example, there are AR apps that let you interact with virtual models of everything you can imagine, from the human body to the solar system. And of course, you experience them like they're really there. Instantly, education becomes much more powerful when every subject comes to life in 3D. And imagine shopping when you can place an object in your living room before you make a purchase, or attending live sporting events when you can see the stats on the field. AR is going to change everything. iOS 11 is also allowing developers to integrate machine learning models into their apps with Core ML. Pinterest is already using Core ML to deliver fast and powerful visual search. PadMapper uses Core ML to provide intelligent features that make it easy to find or rent your apartment. And VisualDx is even pioneering new health diagnostics with Core ML, automating skin image analysis to assist dermatologists with their diagnoses. These are just a few examples. There's so much more to come. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac, which had its best year ever, with the highest annual Mac revenue in Apple's history. It was also the best September quarter ever, with Mac revenue growth of 25% driven by the notebook refreshes we launched in June and a strong back-to-school season. The Mac experience has become even better since the September launch of macOS High Sierra, with new technologies to make Mac more reliable, capable and responsive and lay the foundation for future innovation. Moving on now to Apple Watch. With unit growth of over 50% for the third consecutive quarter, it continues to be the best selling and most loved smartwatch in the world. We began shipping Apple Watch Series 3 just six weeks ago and customers love the new freedom of cellular. The ability to go for a run with just your Apple Watch or go for a quick errand without your phone while staying connected is a game changer. Now more than ever, Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life and is already making a big difference in our customers' lives. We're very excited about the upcoming launch of the Apple Heart Study, which will use data from Apple Watch to identify irregular heart rhythms and notify users when unusual patterns are detected. Earlier this week, we introduced watchOS 4.1, bringing 40 million songs to your wrist through Apple Music. The combination of music streaming on Apple Watch and AirPods is truly a magical experience for people on the go. We're thrilled with the momentum of these products. In fact, our entire wearables business was up 75% year over year in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2017, already generated the annual revenue of a Fortune 400 company. Late in the September quarter, we also launched Apple TV 4K, delivering a stunning cinematic experience at home. So now users around the world can watch movies and shows in 4K HDR quality and stream live sports and news on the Apple TV app. There's already a great selection of 4K HDR titles available through iTunes and other popular video services with many more movies and shows on the way. We're also very excited about the opening of Apple Michigan Avenue two weeks ago on Chicago's riverfront. This is the first store that brings together our complete vision for the future of Apple retail, providing a welcoming place for everyone to experience our products, services and inspiring educational programs right in the heart of their city. In addition to our very popular Today at Apple programming, which is available in all Apple Stores around the world, offering daily sessions in photography, music creation, art and design, coding and entrepreneurship, Apple Michigan Avenue is partnering with local nonprofits and creative organizations to make an ongoing positive impact in that community. Also this quarter, we expanded our free App Development with Swift curriculum to more than 30 community colleges across the country. We're very excited about this initiative, and we're thrilled by the momentum we're seeing. The schools we've launched with this summer are just the beginning. Community colleges have a powerful reach into communities where education is the great equalizer, and the colleges adopting our curriculum this academic year are providing opportunity to millions of students to build apps that will prepare them for careers in software development and information technology and much more. We're incredibly enthusiastic about what our teams have accomplished this year and all the amazing products in our lineup. As we approach the holiday season, we expect it to be our biggest quarter ever. I'd like to thank all of our teams, our partners and our customers for their passion, commitment and loyalty. You've helped us make 2017 a sensational year. Now for more details on the September quarter results, I'd like to turn over the call to Luca.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was a record $52.6 billion, up 12% over last year, and it has been great to see our growth rate accelerate in every quarter of fiscal 2017. Our terrific performance this quarter was very broad based, with revenue growth in all our product categories for the second quarter in a row and new September quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia-Pacific segments. We grew double digits in the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Korea and several other developed markets. We were especially happy to return to growth in greater China, where revenue was up 12% from a year ago and with our momentum in India, where revenue doubled year-over-year. We grew more than 30% in Mexico, the Middle East, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. These results have fueled overall growth of over 20% from emerging markets. Gross margin was 37.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 25% of revenue and net income was $10.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.07, up 24% over last year to a new September quarter record and cash flow from operations was strong at $15.7 billion. During the quarter, we sold 46.7 million iPhones, up 3% over last year. We were very pleased to see double digit iPhone growth in many emerging markets including mainland China, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India and Mexico. We gained share not only in those markets but also in Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Singapore, based on the latest estimates from IDC. iPhone channel inventory increased by 1.3 million units sequentially to support the launch of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, significantly less than the increase in the September quarter a year ago. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a customer satisfaction rating of 97% or higher across all iPhone models. Among consumers planning to buy a smartphone in the next 90 days, purchase intention for iPhone was 69%, more than 5 times the rate of the closest competitor with a loyalty rate for current iPhone owners of 95% compared to 53% for the next highest brand. For corporate smartphone buyers, iOS customer satisfaction was 95% and of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% planned to purchase iPhone. That is the highest score for iPhone in the history of the survey. Turning to Services, we set an all-time quarterly record of $8.5 billion, up 34% year over year. Our results included a favorable one-time revenue adjustment of $640 million. On a run rate basis, excluding this adjustment, services growth of 24% was terrific and the highest that we have experienced this year. The App Store set a new all-time record, and according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a wide and growing margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. We're getting great response to the App Store's new design in iOS 11 from both customers and developers. We're seeing increases in the frequency of customer visits, the amount of time they spend in the store and the number of apps they download. The success of Apple Music also continues to build and we're seeing our highest conversion rates from customers trying the service. Revenue grew strongly once again in the September quarter and the number of paid subscribers was up over 75% year-over-year. We also saw great performance from our iCloud business with very strong double-digit growth in both monthly average users and revenue. Across all of our Services offerings, the number of paid subscriptions reached over 210 million at the end of September quarter, an increase of 25 million in the last 90 days. Apple Pay expanded to Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UAE last month and continues to grow rapidly. Over the past year, active users have more than doubled and annual transactions are up 330%. In the U.S., 70% of leading grocery chains are now accepting Apple Pay with the recent launch of Safeway and over 5 million U.S. merchant locations will be Apple Pay enabled by the end of this year. Next, I would like to talk about the Mac, which for fiscal 2017 set a new all-time revenue record of $25.8 billion. We sold 5.4 million Macs during the September quarter, up 10% over last year and gained significant market share as the global market contracted by 1% based on IDC's latest estimate. This performance was fueled primarily by great demand for MacBook Pro and Mac revenue grew 25% to a new September quarter record. We had outstanding results all around the world with each of our geographic segments growing Mac revenue by 20% or more. We were also very happy with the success of Mac in the education market where customer purchases grew double digits year over year. It was also another great quarter for iPad. We sold 10.3 million units, up 11% over last year with strong demand for both iPad and iPad Pro and revenue grew 14%. It was great to see iPad unit and revenue growth in all of our geographic segments and particularly strong results in emerging markets, including greater China, where iPad units sales were up 25% year-over-year and India, which grew 39%. NPD indicates that iPad had 54% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, including seven of the 10 best-selling tablets. That's up from 47% share a year ago. Also, the most recent surveys from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction rates of 97% across iPad models. And among people planning to buy tablets, purchase intent for iPad was over 70% for both consumers and businesses. We are seeing great momentum with our enterprise initiatives. During the September quarter, we announced a new partnership with Accenture, who is creating a dedicated iOS practice in select locations around the world. Experts from Apple are co-locating with this team and together they'll be launching new tools and services that help enterprise clients transform how they engage with customers using iPhone and iPad. Examples include services to build new customer experiences and to facilitate iOS integration with enterprise systems to help businesses take greater advantage of data from Internet of Things platforms and to enable the smooth transfer of existing legacy applications and data to modern iOS apps. And last month, we announced a partnership with GE to reinvent the way industrial companies work by bringing GE's industrial IoT platform to iOS. The (20:37) SDK for iOS will enable developers to build native apps to drive industrial operations with more efficiency and speed than ever before. GE is also standardizing on iPhone and iPad for its global workforce of more than 330,000 employees and working with Apple, GE is developing iOS apps for both its internal and external audiences to bring predictive data and analytics to workers across a broad range of industries. Beyond our iOS devices, we are also seeing great traction for Mac in the enterprise market with all-time record customer purchases in fiscal year 2017. The September quarter was very strong for our retail and online stores, which welcomed 418 million visitors. Traffic was particularly heavy during the week of our new product announcements, up 19% over last year. Retail ran a very successful back-to-school promotion in the Americas, Europe, China and Singapore, with sales of Mac and iPad Pro up strong double digits compared to last year's program. And around the world, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions during the quarter. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $268.9 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $7.4 billion. $252.3 billion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion in new Canadian and U.S. dollar denominated debt during the quarter, bringing us to $104 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We also returned $11 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 29.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 15.1 million shares and we retire 4.5 million shares upon the completion of our 11th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed almost $234 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $166 billion in share repurchases. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. As a reminder, the December quarter in fiscal 2017 spanned 14 weeks, whereas the December quarter this year will include the usual 13 weeks. We expect revenue to be between $84 billion and $87 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.65 billion and $7.75 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $600 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. Also, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2017, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2017. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. May we have the first question, please?\nOperator: First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Luca, when do you expect to catch up with iPhone X demand? And given it's likely to be not in the December quarter, should we think about March as a better than seasonal revenue quarter because of that iPhone X ramp? And then I have a follow-up.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: I'll take that, Katy. It's Tim. The ramp for iPhone X is going well, especially considering that iPhone X is the most advanced iPhone we've ever created and it has lots of new technologies in it. And so we're really happy that we were able to increase week by week what we're outputting and we're going to get as many of them as possible to the customers as soon as possible. I can't predict, at this point, when that balance will happen. And in terms of March, we obviously don't give guidance beyond the current quarter.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then China growth returned to strong double digits, 12% up. You've talked historically about that region being more sensitive than others to form factor changes and the new iPhone X form factor was not available in September. And so should we assume that growth in that region only accelerates from here as that new product gets pushed into the market.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: Let me talk a little bit about Q4 in China to give you a little bit of color on the results. We increased market share for iPhone, Mac and iPad during the quarter. We hit all-time revenue records for Services and for Mac for the PRC during the quarter. We've had very strong iPad revenue growth. We had double digit unit growth in iPhone and both the upgraders and Android switchers were both up on a year over year basis during the quarter, and so the results were broad based. They were pretty much across the board, as I indicated. The other thing that's happened is that the decline that we've been experiencing in Hong Kong moderated. And so it's still down year over year but less so than it was and part of that is the compare is an easier compare. And then finally, in terms of another headwind that is a little less than it was, currency has been affecting us more significantly. Last quarter in China, it affected us 1 percentage point. And so the sum of all that, I feel great about the results. We don't obviously provide geographic-specific guidance but you can see from our overall guidance, we think we're going to have a really strong quarter.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Piper Jaffray, Mike Olson.\nMichael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good afternoon and congrats on a strong quarter. Is there any information you can provide on how iPhone X pre-orders compared to what you saw with iPhone 8 pre-orders? And then I have a follow-up as well.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: Michael, we never go through mix, but I would share with you that the iPhone X orders are very strong for both direct customers and for our channel partners, which as you know, are lots of carriers throughout the world. And we couldn't be more excited to get underway. And I think as of a few minutes ago, the first sales started in Australia. And I'm told we had several hundred people waiting at the store in Sydney and I'm getting similar reports from across that region.\nMichael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. Thanks. And we're excited about augmented reality and from your perspective, and maybe from our perspective on the outside looking in, how do we gauge the success of AR and what are some of the applications of the technology that you're most excited about today? Thanks.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes, it's a great question. The reason I'm so excited about AR is I view that it amplifies human performance instead of isolates humans. And so as you know, it's the mix of the virtual and the physical world and so it should be a help for humanity, not an isolation kind of thing for humanity. As I go through different countries as I've been traveling lately, and looking at some things in the market, other things that are coming, the very cool thing is they're all over the place. I see things that the consumer's going to love because it's going to change shopping. I see things that consumers will love on the gaming side and the entertainment side. I see business-related AR apps as well. They're going to be great for productivity and between small and large business. And I see apps that makes me want to go back to K-12 again and repeat my schooling because I think it changes the game in the classroom a lot. And so the real beauty here is that it's mainstream. And of course, Apple is the only company that could have brought this because it requires both hardware and software integration, and it requires sort of making a lot of \u2013 or giving the operating system update to many people at once. And the software team worked really hard to make that go back several versions of iPhone so that we sort of have hundreds of millions of enabled devices overnight. And so there's 1,000-plus in the App Store right now. I think this is very much like in 2008, when we fired the gun in the overall App Store. And so that's what it feels like to me, and I think it will just get bigger from here.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much. A couple questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit about how you're thinking in terms of the lineup? You go from $340 \u2013 this is for iPhone \u2013 you go from $349 to above $1,000. And it appears that you probably sold a fair amount at the lower end. Perhaps that was just some of the switchers in China and maybe drove some of the growth in China in terms of market share. But how are you sort of thinking about what went into the guidance for the December quarter? Are you seeing really strong demand at the low end and obviously expected benefit from the X at the high end? I'm just trying to understand because you have such a broader lineup than you've had in prior years.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes. In terms of what we saw in Q4, you can probably tell from the ASP we had good success, I would say, through the different iPhones. And we've tried hard to have an iPhone that is as affordable as possible for people that really want an iPhone but may have a more limited budget. And we've got some iPhones that are really great for that market. And then we've got three new iPhones and people will look at these and decide which one they want. And this is the first time we've ever been in the position that we've had three new iPhones at once like this at the top end of the line. And it's the first time we've had a staggered launch. And so we're going to see what happens, but we put our absolutely best thinking that we have here in the guidance that Luca presented, and you can tell from that, that we're bullish.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Great. Thank you. And then in terms of Services, $8.5 billion, up 34%, can you talk about some of the portions of that that outperformed, how sustainable? You mentioned China in terms of significant growth in Services, but I'm just curious. That's a pretty remarkable number, so I'm curious what the drivers were. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes, Shannon. It's Luca. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was a $640 million adjustment and there was a one-off change. And it's important to call it out because of course it's a one-off. And so the underlying growth rate for service in the quarter was fantastic. It was 24%. It's the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal 2017. So the business is going incredibly well. I would highlight maybe three of these businesses within Services at the App Store set a new all-time record. It's going incredibly well. The number of paying accounts continues to grow very strongly, and that's very, very important to us for the App Store business. Apple Music was up, subscriptions were up 75% year over year. We're getting the highest conversion rates that we've had since the launch of the service. And so we turned the corner in Music. You remember that a few years ago, we were actually declining in Music; now with the streaming service in addition to the download business, the business is growing again. And that really helps the growth rate for the entire Services business. iCloud is a service that continues to grow very strong double digits, and that's also helping. So we already become the size of a Fortune 100 company. We set a goal for ourselves to double what we did in fiscal 2016, and the trajectory is actually quite positive.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Steve Milunovich with UBS.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. I wanted to try to push a little bit more on the mix. Could you comment whether the 8 Plus outsold the 8 in the quarter? There seems to be some data that suggests that. And the 451 Research survey that you're alluding to also finds that over the next 90 days, those buying an iPhone, 43% are planning on buying the X. Could you comment upon your expectations in terms of the mix going forward? And if you won't do that, perhaps you could comment a bit about your thinking in terms of pushing price elasticity. I think a couple years ago, nobody would've imagined selling a phone at this price and obviously, you're pretty confident that you can do it.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: Obviously, I'm not going to talk about mix. That's something that we've done in the past. If you look at the 8 and 8 Plus, when we launched them, they instantly became our top two selling products. If you look at 8 Plus in particular, to provide a little color there, 8 Plus for the period of time that we can measure to date, has gotten off to the fastest start of any Plus model. That for us was a bit of a surprise, and a positive surprise, obviously. And so we'll see what happens next. As I've mentioned before, we've never had three products and it's only today that the first customers can sort of look at all three of those and I'm sure there's been some people that wanted to do that before deciding even which one. And so we'll see what happens there. But in terms of price elasticity, I think it's important to remember that a large number of people pay for the phone by month. And so if you were to go out on just the U.S., since that tends to be more of the focus of this call, you look at the U.S. carriers, I think you would find you could buy an iPhone X for $33 a month. And so if you think about that, that's a few coffees a week. It's let's say less than a coffee a day at one of these nice coffee places. The other thing to keep in mind is that many people are now trading in their current iPhone on the next iPhone. And the residual value for iPhone tends to be the highest in the industry and many people pick up $300, $350 or so for their iPhone and so that even reduces the monthly payment less. And then obviously, some carriers also have promotional things going on. And so I do think it's important to try to place it in that context. In terms of the way we price, we price to sort of the value that we're providing. We're not trying to charge the highest price we could get or anything like that. We're just trying to price it for what we're delivering. And iPhone X has a lot of great new technologies in there that are leading the industry, and it is a fabulous product and we can't wait for people to start getting it in their hands.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: And then I wanted ask, the Street historically has been a little skeptical about continued innovation and you've suggested there is more to go. Historically, you weren't first to large screens, you weren't first to OLED. Now though, you're leading in AR, you're leading with face ID, which the all-in a year ago, as some of your guys have suggested, was kind of very reminiscent of the aggressive Apple. Is it possible going forward that you could accelerate share gains from Android because you're now in a stronger competitive position?\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: I think, Steve, we've been in a competitive position. And so I probably maybe have a different view than you do or the folks that you're quoting. There's always doubting Thomases out there. And I've been hearing those for the 20 years I've been here and suspect I'll hear about them until I retire, right. So I don't really listen to that too much. There's lots of fantastic people here and they're doing unbelievable things. And yes, I view AR as profound. Not today, not the app that you'll see on the App Store today, but what it will be, what it can be. I think it's profound and I think Apple is in a really unique position to lead in this area.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. Just following up a little bit on that question, Tim. You talked a bit about providing a lot of value and that Apple sets its prices according to value. And I think given the uniqueness of the product you have with the iPhone X in particular, that makes a lot of sense. I guess the question is given the uniqueness of the value that you have in the marketplace, why shouldn't we \u2013 should we, or why shouldn't we expect gross margins to improve this cycle versus previous ones? And perhaps you can talk a little bit about how you think about pricing in the context of gross margin. And I have a follow-up, please.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Toni, I'll take that one. When \u2013 you said we price our products for the value that we deliver. We also said that every time we launch new products, the cost structures of the new products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It's inevitable. We are adding new technologies, new features, and therefore the cost structures go up. We have a very good track record of taking those cost structures and over the life cycle of the product, we are able to bring them down. There are a lot of elements in the gross margin line that we have good control over and there are also elements that we don't control. Take for example foreign exchange, which has been a significant headwind for the company for the last three years now. Also, the mix of products that we sell into the market tends to change over time, and that also has an impact on the overall gross margin for the company. There are situations where the commodities markets are in good shape. There are situations where commodity markets can be a bit out of balance. We have a case right now around memory pricing, which is a headwind for the time being. So there's many puts and takes. The fact that our Services business is growing, it should be a positive because our Services margins tend to be accretive to company margins. So there's many puts and takes. We tend to think about maximizing gross margin dollars because we think that's the most important thing for investors at the end of the day. When we look at our track record over years, I think we've found a good balance between unit grow and gross margins and revenue, and we will continue to do that as we go forward.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to revisit this notion of supply and demand, and I realize it's very early and you can't make predictions. I think a common investor question is, the iPhone X was made available for sale. It quickly had pushed out availability levels to unprecedented levels versus history. And so I think the really significant question is, is that initial push-out really a function of uniquely strong demand versus history or is that push-out in availability really a function of much weaker supply versus history? So it'd be really helpful. You have in the past commented on first 24-hour orders, for which there were 4 million plus for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. You have very often on this call talked about targeting when you think you could reach supply/demand balance. So it'd be really helpful if you could provide some context in terms of what you know, either about initial orders or about a supplies versus history that can help investors try and better understand the little data points that they're seeing in terms of availability of the device. Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: The truth is we don't know. We've put our best estimate into the guidance, and you can see from the guidance that we are very bullish. And so, and we feel really great about the product lineup. We just sold the first units minutes ago. And so we'll see how things go. Until you get all of them out there where customers have the ability to demo and support, I think any kind of mix discussion is very much estimating. And so we put our best estimates in, but grantedly, we've never done this before. So there's no comparison here, with either the three iPhones nor the staggered launch. So we're going to learn something.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That is Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. And I'll ask my original question and follow-up at the same time because they're slightly different topics. But you'd mentioned great success in India. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned, I think, India doubled year over year. Based upon market analysis, it looks like Apple's still just a relatively small sliver of the pie there. So Tim, what would it take be even more successful in India? Is it a manufacturing footprint there? Is it partners? Is it more physical stores? Is it lower price points? Is it the bandwidth that has now caught up to many other countries, or how should we think about that? And then the follow-up question is on the AR/VR, where will it really show up in your income statement? Are you hoping more for hardware sales or services through the apps or where the excitement will then monetize it within Apple? Thank you.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: In terms of India, many of the things that you mentioned are correct. Growing a market like India is a result of all of those things and doing them all well. And so it's analogous to the many years that we put into China. It's building stores. It's building channels. It's building markets. It's building the developer ecosystem. It's having the right product lineup for the market. And I feel like we're making good progress there and are gaining understanding of the market, but we still have a long way to go, which I sort of see as an opportunity instead of a problem. And I do feel great about the growth rate. And so that's India. I think it's all of those things. As you know, as I think we talked about before, we started manufacturing the iPhone SE there six, nine months ago so. And the majority of the iPhone SEs that we sold in the domestic market last quarter were manufactured there. And so we also have that going and are hoping that that winds up saving some amount of money over time and avoiding some of the compounding of taxes, et cetera. The bandwidth issue has also been an issue, but as you point out, it is being addressed and between the large carriers there with Bharti and now Jio investing the way they are, the service in India is materially better than it was just 12 months ago. So there's been a sea change there in a short period of time. So I feel good about all that, but we have a long way to go. In terms of the monetization question on AR/VR, we tend to focus first and foremost on customer experience. And so we're all about making sure the experience is great. And we think that if we get the experience right, that revenues and profits will be a result of getting that right. And so we're very much focused on the experience right now.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Jim.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you so much for your details. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets,\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I have two as well. I guess maybe to start with on gross margins. Luca, year over year revenues are going to be up high single digits at the midpoint, gross margin will be down a little. Could you just tell us what are the puts and takes on that? And are yield inefficiencies broadly much more severe this time versus what you've seen historically?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes. Amit, so we're guiding 38% to 38.5%. That's up 35 bps sequentially. Obviously we're getting the leverage from the larger volumes. As I mentioned, I think to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products. So that is going to be the offset, and I mentioned particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment which is a headwind at this point. Just to size it for you, the impact of memory on our gross margin is 40 bps sequentially and 110 bps on a year over year basis. So they are meaningful impacts, and I think that is what I think probably you're referring to.\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess if I could just follow up on the Services line. I mean you guys talked about it a fair amount earlier, but even if you exclude the one-time gain, it looks like the back half of 2017 accelerated by 500 basis points in fiscal 2017 versus the first half of 2017. Qualitatively or quantitatively, is there a way to think about how much of this is from expanding of the installed base, which is one of the three things you mentioned I think, versus more dollar per iOS device that you see?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes. I think it's both. As I mentioned, particularly on the App Store, which is very important to us, the number of paying accounts has grown a lot. It's grown a lot because, as you said, the installed base has grown, but also because we have made a number of changes that have made it easier for our customers around the world to participate on the App Store and be able to transact on the App Store. We are accepting, for example, more forms of payment today than we were 12 months ago or even 6 months ago. So that's been very important. We also see that there is a typical spending curve for our customers. When they start transacting on the Store, they start at a certain level and they tend over time to get more familiar with the Store and they start to spend more. We're also now, very recently, made some changes, as you probably have seen, to the design of the App Store. And I was mentioning to you in the prepared remarks that these changes have been received very favorably. And so people now are spending more time on the Store, they download more apps, and that over time translates into monetization. But we also have other businesses that are growing very, very fast and actually accelerating. I mentioned Music. I mentioned iCloud, and so it all adds up. And as you correctly point out, our growth rate is accelerating.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: From Drexel Hamilton, Brian White.\nBrian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Yeah, Tim, I'm wondering if we take a look at mainland China and we think about iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, they've been on sale for a while now. What has been the just general response to those two new iPhones and also preorders around the iPhone X in mainland China?\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: Brian, I hate to repeat this, but we don't really disclose mix. We view it as competitive information that we want to hold tightly ourselves. In terms of the way the preorder process works in China in the channel, so not in our direct channel, but in the broader carrier channel and channel, they generally take indications of interest versus something that I would label a preorder. And so I would hesitate to even quote a number for fear it could be misconstrued. And we'll find out what the demand and where the supply and demand meet sometime in the future. I don't know when yet, but we're really excited to get going to find out.\nBrian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: And, Tim, it's interesting that sales grew 16% sequentially. If you look at the past five years, sales were up 7% in the September quarter, so that's an average. Yet you didn't have all your iPhones in the market. So if you had to, what would you attribute that to? It's a pretty big disconnect, 16% versus an average of 7%.\nTimothy D. Cook - Apple, Inc.: Our emerging market performance during the quarter was very strong. And if you take China out, it's even stronger. But you can see that China rebounded. And as I'd indicated before, the China rebound was broad based across the products. And so we just had a phenomenal quarter on iPad, on the Mac, on Services, on Apple Watch, on iPhone. I mean we're literally, we're firing on all cylinders. And so that's what, that and our new products give us great confidence headed into this holiday season that this is going to be the best holiday season yet.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Brian.\nBrian J.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's Form 10-K for 2016, the Form 10-Q for the first two quarters of 2017, and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Today we're proud to announce very strong results for our fiscal third quarter, with unit and revenue growth in all of our product categories. We'll review our financial performance in detail, and I'd also like to talk about some of the major announcements we made in June at our Worldwide Developers Conference. It was our biggest and best WWDC ever, and the advances we introduced across hardware, software, and services will help us to delight our customers and extend our competitive lead this fall and well into the future. For the quarter, total revenue was at the high end of our guidance range at $45.4 billion. That's an increase of 7% over last year, so our growth rate has accelerated in three successive quarters this fiscal year. Gross margin was also at the high end of our guidance, and we generated a 17% increase in earnings per share. iPhone results were impressive, with especially strong demand at the high end of our lineup. iPhone 7 was our most popular iPhone, and sales of iPhone 7 Plus were up dramatically compared to iPhone 6s Plus in the June quarter of last year. The combined iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus family was up strong double digits year over year. One decade after the initial iPhone launch, we have now surpassed 1.2 billion cumulative iPhones sold. Services revenue hit an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, representing 22% growth over last year. We continue to see great performance all around the world, with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments. Over the last 12 months, our Services business has become the size of a Fortune 100 company, a milestone we've reached even sooner than we had expected. We had very positive results for iPad, with broad-based growth in units, revenue, and market share. iPad sales were up 15% year over year and grew across all of our geographic segments. We achieved our highest global market share in over four years based on IDC's latest estimate of tablet market results for the June quarter. And in markets like China and Japan, over half of iPads sold were to people buying their very first iPad. Our iPad product lineup is stronger than ever. The new iPad we launched in March offers great value and performance. And the all-new 10.5-inch iPad Pro, launched in June, features the world's most advanced display with ProMotion technology and is more powerful than most PC desktops. iPad is the perfect tool for teaching in new and compelling ways, and our iPad results were especially strong in the U.S. education market, where sales were up 32% year over year to over 1 million units. We believe that coding is an essential skill that all students should learn. We're thrilled that over 1.2 million students of all ages are now using iPad and Swift Playgrounds to learn the fundamentals of coding. And over 1,000 K-12 schools across the United States plan to use Apple's Everyone Can Code in their curricula this fall. And for high school and community college students who want to pursue careers in the fast-growing app economy, we announced app development with Swift, an innovative full-year curriculum designed by Apple engineers and educators and provided free to schools to teach students to code and design fully functional apps, gaining critical job skills in software development and information technology. I'd like to turn now to Mac, which gained global unit market share and reached new June quarter unit sales records in mainland China and Japan. Mac revenue grew 7% year over year, driven by the strength of the MacBook Pro and iMac despite IDC's latest estimate of a 4% unit contraction in the global PC market. And with the refresh of almost our entire Mac lineup in June, we're off to a great start for the back-to-school season. Sales of Apple Watch were up over 50% in the June quarter, and it's the number one selling smartwatch in the world by a very wide margin. Apple Watch is having a positive impact on people's health and daily lives and motivating them to sit less and move more. With features like built-in GPS and waterproofing, Apple Watch Series 2 is the perfect companion for hiking, running, and swimming. We're also seeing incredible enthusiasm for AirPod, with 98% customer satisfaction based on Creative Strategy's survey. We have increased production capacity for AirPods and are working very hard to get them to customers as quickly as we can, but we are still not able to meet the strong level of demand. We made some big announcements during the June quarter that I'd like to quickly review. We launched a new investment in the future through our Advanced Manufacturing Fund. We've earmarked at least $1 billion for this program, aimed at helping our manufacturing partners develop innovative production capabilities and create high-skill jobs in the United States. We believe this can lay the foundation for a new era of technology-driven manufacturing in the U.S. The first $200 million from the fund has been committed to Corning to support R&D, capital equipment needs, and state-of-the-art glass processing. And as we announced at WWDC, we have a very exciting fall ahead, with stunning advances in iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, and watchOS4. iOS 11 will make iPhones better than ever with Apple Pay peer-to peer payments, an even more intelligent and natural Siri, new expressive messages with full screen effects, richer and more powerful maps, enhanced live photos and memories and portrait mode effects, and much, much more. iOS 11 will also take the iPad experience to a whole new level, with features such as a customizable dock, Multi-Touch drag and drop, powerful new multitasking, more efficient QuickTime, and great new markup and scanning capabilities. One of the most exciting and most promising announcements from WWDC was the introduction of ARKit, a new set of tools for developers to create augmented reality apps. It's still early in the beta period, but it's clear that ARKit has captured the imagination of our developer community. We think ARKit will help the most creative minds in the industry tap into the latest computer vision technologies to build engaging content. We believe AR has broad mainstream applicability across education, entertainment, interactive gaming, enterprise, and categories we probably haven't even thought of. With hundreds of millions of people actively using iPhone and iPad today, iOS will become the world's biggest augmented reality platform as soon as iOS 11 ships. With iOS 11, we're also bringing the power of machine learning to all Apple developers with Core ML, enabling capabilities like face detection, object tracking, and natural language interpretation. Core ML lets developers incorporate machine learning technologies into their apps with all the processing done right on device, so it respects our customers' data and privacy. For Mac, we provided a peek at the immersive gaming, 3D, and virtual reality experiences made possible with the upcoming release of macOS High Sierra and the amazingly powerful new iMac Pro. We're proud to make the best personal computers in the industry and are very excited to deliver even more innovation in the months to come. Apple Watch will become more intelligent than ever this fall with watchOS4, featuring a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an entirely new music experience. watchOS4 also introduces GymKit, a groundbreaking technology program to connect workouts with cardio equipment. We also previewed HomePod, a breakthrough wireless speaker for the home that delivers amazing audio quality and uses spatial awareness to sense its location in the room and adjust the audio automatically. Visitors to our listening room at WWDC were blown away by the HomePod's incredible sound, which is unlike any other wireless home speaker on the market. With deep knowledge of music, HomePod is designed to work with your Apple Music subscription to help you enjoy the music you already love as well as to discover great new music, based on your personal preferences. As an intelligent home assistant, HomePod is a great way to send messages, set a timer, get updates on news, sports, and weather, or control smart home kit devices by simply asking Siri to turn on the lights, close the shades, or activate a theme. We can't wait to deliver all of these powerful innovations in the months to come. And we might even have some others to share with you later in the year. Now for more details on the June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $45.4 billion, up 7% over last year, an acceleration to the growth rate we reported during the first half of our fiscal year. We achieved these results despite a 200 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis, as currency movements, especially in Europe and China, affected our reported results. Our performance was very strong across the board with growth in all our product categories and almost every market around the world. We achieved double-digit revenue growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Spain, Australia, and Korea, and emerging markets outside of Greater China grew 19% over a year ago. Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 23.7% of revenue and net income was $8.7 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67, up 17% over last year, and cash flow from operations was $8.4 billion. During the quarter we sold 41 million iPhones and reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units, leaving us with our lowest level of channel inventory in 2.5 years and well within our five-week to seven-week target inventory range. iPhone sales were up year-over-year in most markets we track, with many markets in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East growing unit sales by more than 25%. We are very pleased with these iPhone results, especially considering the tough comparison to the June quarter last year when we launched iPhone SE. iPhone ASP was $606, up from $595 a year ago, thanks to strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which represented a higher percentage of the iPhone mix compared to the Plus model a year ago. The impact of the stronger mix on ASP was partially offset by negative foreign exchange year over year and the reduction in channel inventory, which took place entirely at the high end of the portfolio. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong with both consumers and business uses. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPhone 7 and 99% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among consumers planning to buy a smartphone, purchase intention for iPhone was nearly three times the rate of our closest competitor. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iOS customer satisfaction was 94%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone. Turning to Services, we set an all-time quarterly record of $7.3 billion, up 22% year over year. The App Store was a major driver of this performance. And according to App Annie's latest report, it continues to be by a wide margin the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. Revenue from our Apple Music streaming service and from iCloud storage also grew very strongly. And across all of our Services offerings, the number of paid subscriptions reached over 185 million, an increase of almost 20 million in the last 90 days alone. The reach, usage, and functionality of Apple Pay continue to grow. We launched Apple Pay in Italy in May. And the UAE, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden are scheduled to go live before the end of this calendar year. Apple Pay is by far the number one NFC payment service on mobile devices, with nearly 90% of all transactions globally. Momentum is strongest in international markets, where the infrastructure for mobile payments has developed faster than in the U.S. In fact, three out of four Apple Pay transactions happen outside the U.S. And with the launch of iOS 11 this fall, our users in the U.S. will be able to make and receive person-to-person payments quickly, easily, and securely. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Thanks to great performance from the new MacBook Pro, we generated 7% revenue growth over last year and gained share in the global PC market based on the latest data from IDC. Customer satisfaction for Mac is very strong at 97% in the most recent survey from 451 Research, and our active installed base of Mac has grown double digits over a year ago. We ended the quarter within our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory, and we have a great lineup of Macs for our customers heading into the busy back-to-school season. Turning to iPad, we sold 11.4 million units, up 15% over last year. We were happy to see iPad growth in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit increases in key markets such as the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, and Greater China. We exited the quarter within our five to seven-week target range for iPad channel inventory. NPD indicates that iPad had 55% share of the U.S. tablet market in the month of June, including 8 of the 10 best-selling tablets. That's up from 46% share a year ago. And among tablets priced over $200, iPad's share was 89%. In addition, the most recent survey from 451 Research measured business and consumer satisfaction rates ranging from 95% to 99% across iPad models. And among those planning to buy tablets, purchase intent for iPad was over 70%. Our enterprise business continues to expand, and our customers are transforming the way work gets done with iOS and iPad. Walmart will be deploying more than 19,000 iPads for employee training across 50 states, with projections of over 225,000 associates trained on iPad by the end of the year. Initial response from businesses to iOS 11 and the new iPad Pro has been amazing. And companies including Bank of America, Medtronic, and Panera tell us that they will be rolling out the 10.5-inch iPad Pro throughout key areas of their organizations. We're also seeing real traction with our enterprise partners. Just last month, we unveiled the next set of technology announcements in our partnership with Cisco. This new wave adds a whole new category of security features designed to help enterprises and employees defend against growing cyber threats. We believe this investment in our joint security solutions for iOS will make cyber insurance even more attainable for businesses. SAP is making great strides since launching the SAP cloud platform SDK for iOS in March, with a pipeline of hundreds of global opportunities. SAP has also released SuccessFactors Mobile, its first native iOS app for human resources, which will support 47 million iPhone and iPad users worldwide across multiple industries. And our partnership with Deloitte has recently expanded to several more European countries. We're helping clients transform their businesses with iOS. We jointly developed programs such as the Connected Store, a pop-up version of a retail environment, demonstrating iOS tools for sales and demand generation, as well as tailored apps for safe associates, store management, and customers. We also had a tremendous quarter for iPad in education, up 32% year over year. Following the launch of our new iPad in March, an update to our popular Classroom app, and continued enhancements to iOS that make managing iPads in the classroom even easier. The St. Paul Public School District in Minnesota is renewing its One to One program by deploying over 40,000 iPads across every student and teacher in the district. iPad was chosen because of its power and durability, ease of use, multimedia and accessibility features, and the extensive catalog of iOS apps designed specifically for education. The Shawnee Mission School District outside Kansas City recently purchased 19,000 iPads, extending its One to One program started in 2014 thanks to iPad's intuitive interface, superior reliability, and expansive ecosystem of iOS tools for education. It was a very busy quarter for our retail and online stores, which collectively welcomed over 300 million visitors. In addition to our spectacular new store at the Dubai Mall, we opened our first stores in Singapore and in Taiwan during the quarter, expanding our total store footprint to 497 stores. In May, we kicked off Today at Apple, with new in-store programming from music to photography to art and coding. And our stores collectively hosted 87,000 sessions during the quarter. As Tim mentioned last quarter, we have entered a new chapter in retail with unique and rewarding experiences for our customers and some stunning new stores coming in the near future. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $261.5 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $4.7 billion. $246 billion of this cash, 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We retired $3.5 billion of debt and issued the equivalent of $10.8 billion in new euro and U.S. dollar-denominated debt during the quarter, including our second green bond, bringing us to $96.4 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We also returned $11.7 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $4.5 billion on repurchases of 30.4 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We launched a new $3 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 15.6 million shares, and we retired 3.4 million shares upon the completion of our 10th ASR during the quarter. We have now completed $222.9 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $158.5 billion in share repurchases. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $49 billion and $52 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.7 billion and $6.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $500 million. And we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on August 17, 2017 to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2017. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Luca, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Rebecca, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: And that question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, first question for you, gross margin guidance is strong, but it did tick down from your June quarter guidance, and you also narrowed the range to 50 basis points. I wonder if you can just address. What is the driver of the sequential downtick, and what gives you confidence that you have more visibility than you did three months ago?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Katy, sequentially from 38.5% that we just reported, typically we have product transition costs during the September quarter. That's the primary driver. This happens fairly regularly for us. We also have a more difficult memory pricing environment this year than a year ago. And we think that we're going to be able to partially offset this with the positive leverage. As you've seen, we guided up sequentially in revenue. So those are the major puts and takes. In terms of the range that we use for gross margins, we have a fairly good understanding on where we are with our hedging program, and that allows us to mitigate some of the volatility there. So we felt we could guide to a slightly narrower range, which we've done occasionally in the past.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, and maybe a question for both Tim and Luca. As you outlined on this call and at the Developer Conference in June, there is an unprecedented number of products that either ramped volume or launched in the back half of this year. So appreciating you only formally guide a quarter out, I wonder if there's any qualitative commentary you can provide to help us think about the back half of this calendar year and how all those new products that come into the model could impact either revenue seasonality versus past years or could impact just the costs associated with ramping that many products all at once. Thanks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Katy, as Luca mentioned, we did assume some transitional costs in our guidance for the quarter, as is typically the case. And we're looking very much forward to the product rollouts.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, could you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? I think obviously, there continues to be strong demand for smartphones. But perhaps mix shift, I think you brought back the iPhone 6 this quarter to be a bit more price aggressive. And then can you just talk a bit about how you see that market developing with the growth of WeChat and some of the other developments that are happening there? Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Shannon. We were very encouraged by the results this quarter. We improved as we thought we would from the previous quarters a little more than I thought we would. If you look underneath the numbers, mainland China was actually flat year-over-year during Q3. And in constant currency terms, we were actually up 6% in mainland China. And so we're very encouraged about that. iPad grew dramatically more than the market. The Mac grew much more than the market. iPhone was relatively flat year-on-year, similar as the market was. And so we see all of those as very encouraging signs. On top of that, Services grew extremely strongly during the quarter. Hong Kong continued to drag down the total Greater China segment. But on a sequential basis, we're probably at the trough of that, which is nice. With the peg to the dollar there from a currency point of view and tourism being what it is, I don't really know when that market will come back. But what we see on the mainland is definitely much more encouraging. It's interesting to note that upgraders both for the quarter and actually for the full fiscal year to-date was our highest ever, and so that we felt very good about. In terms of WeChat, the way that I look at this is because our share \u2013 because iOS share is not nearly a majority of the market in China, the fact that a lot of people use that, it makes the switching opportunity even greater. And I think that's more the case than the risk that a lot of folks have pointed out. And so I see Tencent as one of our biggest and best developers. They've done a great job of implementing a lot of iOS features in their apps and we're looking forward to working with them even more to build even greater experiences for our mutual users in China.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about the composition of the installed base of iPhones at this point, as obviously we're getting close to a refresh? Just you brought in the iPhone SE. You've obviously had strength at the high end. I'm just trying to think about what percent do you think have upgraded in the prior generation, any color you can give us on that?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: From an absolute quantity point of view, the upgrades for this fiscal year are the highest that we've seen. And so we feel good about that. However, if you look at it from an upgrade rate point of view instead of the absolute number, the rate is similar to what we saw with the previous iPhones, except for iPhone 6, which as we called out in the past had an abnormally high upgrade rate. We do think that based on the amount of rumors and the volume of them that there is some pause in our current numbers. And so where that affects us in the short-term, even though we had great results, it probably bodes well later on.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Steve Milunovich with UBS.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. I wonder if you wanted to make any comments about switching this quarter.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Sure. Switching outside of China was up year-on-year, and so we're happy with that. We continue to see people moving over to iOS and it helped with us making the results that Luca announced earlier, including the channel inventory reduction.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, and then a government question. First of all, the President suggested that you may build three big beautiful plants. I wonder if you can comment on if that's a possibility either directly or indirectly. And then in China, I think, we all understand that you have to work within the regulations, but maybe you could comment a bit on how you feel your working relationship is with the government and if there is certain lines that you can't cross.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Sure. Starting with the U.S., let me just take this question from what are we doing to increase jobs, which I think is probably where it's rooted. We've created 2 million jobs in the U.S., and we're incredibly proud of that. We do view that we have a responsibility in the U.S. to increase economic activity, including increasing jobs, because Apple could have only been created here. And so as we look at that 2 million, there are three main categories of that, and we have actions going on in each of them to further build on that momentum. The first category is app development. About three-quarters of the 2 million are app developers. And we're doing an enormous amount of things to deliver curriculum to both K-12 with Swift Playgrounds in the K-to-6 area, other curriculum as you proceed beyond grade 6 under the Everyone Can Code area. And just a couple months ago, we announced a new curriculum that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, for kids that did not have coding in their elementary and high school years. And so we're excited about that because we think it could increase the diversity of the developer community and the quantity. And I think this area in general and all the things we do for the developer community will be the largest contribution that Apple can make because this is the fastest growing job segment in the country, and I think will be for quite some time. If you look at the second area, we have purchased \u2013 or we purchased last year about $50 billion worth of goods and services from U.S.-based suppliers. Some significant portion of those are manufacturing-related, and so we've asked ourselves what can we do to increase this. And you may have seen that at the beginning of the quarter, sometime in April I believe, we announced a fund, an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, that we're initially placing $1 billion in. And we've already deployed $200 million of that. And the first recipient is Corning in Kentucky, and they'll be using that money to expand the plant to make very innovative glass. And we purchase that glass and essentially export it to the world with iPhones and iPads. We think there's more of these that we can do. I think there are probably several plants that can benefit from having some investment to grow or expand or even maybe set up shop in the U.S. for the first time, so we're very excited about that. And then the third area is we have about two-thirds or so of our total employee base is in the U.S. despite only a third of our revenues being here, and we'll have some things that we'll say about that later in the year. And so that's what we're doing from a job growth point of view, and we're very, very proud of that. Now turning to China, let me comment on what I assumed is at the root of your question about this VPN issue. Let me just address that head on. The central government in China back in 2015 started tightening the regulations associated with VPN apps, and we have a number of those on our store. Essentially, as a requirement for someone to operate a VPN, they have to have a license from the government there. Earlier this year, they began a renewed effort to enforce that policy, and we were required by the government to remove some of the VPN apps from the App Store that don't meet these new regulations. We understand that those same requirements are on other app stores, and as we checked through that, that is the case. Today there are actually still hundreds of VPN apps on the App Store, including hundreds by developers that are outside China, and so there continues to be VPN apps available. We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business. And we strongly believe that participating in markets and bringing benefits to customers is in the best interest of the folks there and in other countries as well. And so we believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree. And in this particular case, now back to commenting on this one, we're hopeful that over time the restrictions that we're seeing are loosened because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate, and I know that that is a major focus there. And so that's what we're seeing from that point of view. Some folks have tried to link it to the U.S. situation last year, and they're very different. In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us, which was very clear. In the case of China, the law is also very clear there. And like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we'd have to abide by them in both cases, that doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way. We always do that. And so hopefully that's a little bit probably more than you wanted to know, but I wanted to tell you.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll hear from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.\nKulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you, a question for Tim maybe on the iPhone install base. At various points in the past you've told us the rate at which that was growing. At the end of the first half, what is that up year on year? At what rate is it growing? Can you give us some sense of that? And on upgrade rates over the longer term, there are lots of moving parts, and I get that there's I guess geographic mix shift of your base. There's many new phones that you may or may not bring out. There's how carriers promote your products. But do you think this upgrade rate is sustainable? Do you think it gets faster all the time? How should we think about the major drivers that you want to see for it? Many thanks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I think the upgrade rate is a function of many, many different things, from the size of the installed base, the age of the installed base, the product that is new at the time, the regional distribution, the upgrade plans that are in various markets around the world. And so I think there are many, many factors in that. It's not a simple thing that you can apply a set formula to or one variable or a couple of variable formula in my opinion. But I think in general, because our installed base was up strong double digit once again, there's a lot of factors that are very positive for us. And between the upgraders and the switchers that we see, and the first-time buyer category is still out there too in several countries, including some that you may not think there is, there's still a sizable base in some. Between those three areas, I think we have a lot of opportunity.\nKulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Kulbinder. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim, please. Luca, typically in the fiscal Q4, Apple builds considerable iPhone channel inventory, like 2 million or 3 million units. You're starting from a very low point at the end of fiscal Q3, as you mentioned on the call, with the drawdown. As we think about what's embedded in your guidance for fiscal Q4 for channel inventory for iPhone, should we be expecting a normal seasonal build, or is it likely to be significantly higher given the very low starting point?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: As you know, Toni, we do not guide on channel inventory. We've never done that. We are providing a fairly wide range from a revenue standpoint, so obviously that also has an impact on potential channel inventory levels. One thing that I would tell you is that we feel very good about the performance of the business right now. We think that our Services business will continue to grow well. We've got a lot of momentum on iPad and Mac because we refreshed the lineups of those products. Watch and AirPods are doing incredibly well. We're getting a lot of positive customer feedback. And I think in general, even the performance in China, Tim has mentioned it. We think that the performance will continue to improve. So those are the drivers of our guidance range for the quarter.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks. Tim, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about two things that you mentioned in public before. One is television, which you have described as an area of intense interest, but I don't even think there was an update on Apple TV on this call. So perhaps you can talk to us about how you're thinking about content. I know you're doing some original content creation, and how that area is evolving in your thinking. And then recently you talked about how Apple is focusing on autonomous systems for automobiles. And there has been press reports that Apple has been testing autonomous vehicles for potentially up to a year. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Apple's interest in autonomous vehicles and whether self-driving is really likely to be Apple's principal focus in the near to medium-term.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: On the first part of your question about original content, we have done some original content. It's focused on Apple Music. Currently, we have some more that's launching in a week or so that will be made available on Apple Music. The objective of this is really twofold. One is for our own learning, given that we're new in the video space in terms of creation. And two is to give the Apple Music subscriber some exclusive content and hopefully grow our subscriber base. And we've recently hired two great folks with lots of experience in creating content like Breaking Bad and The Crown and some really top-notch content. And so we'll see how this area goes, but it is still an area of great interest. In terms of autonomous systems, what we've said is that we are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view. We do have a large project going and are making a big investment in this. From our point of view, autonomy is the mother of all AI projects. And the autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways and a vehicle is only one. But there are many different areas of it and I don't want to go any further with that. But thank you for the question.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.\nMichael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Good afternoon. I just have one question for Tim. This may be a hard question to answer in a condensed way, but how would you describe what you expect the most near-term applications will be for developers to target using ARKit? Will it be consumer iPhone and iPad applications, enterprise applications, or I guess some combination of the two? And basically, how does this come to market in the most significant way in the next few quarters as Apple becomes the largest global platform for AR as you've talked about? Thanks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Mike, that is a great question. And I could not be more excited about AR and what we're seeing with ARKit in the early going. And to answer your question about what category it starts in, just take a look at what's already on the web in terms of what people are doing and it is all over the place. From entertainment to gaming, I've seen what I would call more small business solutions. I've seen consumer solutions. I've seen enterprise solutions. I think AR is big and profound and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it. So I think that customers are going to see it in a variety of ways. Enterprise takes a little longer sometimes to get going. But I can already tell you there's lots of excitement in there. And I think we'll start to see some applications there as well. And it feels great to get this thing going at a level that can get all of the developers behind it, so I couldn't be more excited about it.\nMichael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Amit Daryanani.\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess to start off with, on your Services segment, revenues actually I think accelerated by 400 basis points to worse than what you guys had in the first half of this year. Could you just help us understand what's driving this? Is there a way to think about ARPU in a traditional manner within that Services business versus the installed base growing?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Amit, Luca. Our Services business is very broad. We've got multiple categories in the Services business, so it's difficult to talk about ARPU in general. It doesn't make a lot of sense. The reason for the acceleration also here is multiple factors. One that is very, very important for us is the fact that the App Store, which is the largest of our Services categories, is seeing an increasingly larger amount of paying accounts. On a year-over-year basis, the number of accounts that are actually transacting and paying on the App Store is growing very, very well. It is happening for a variety of reasons. One of them, for example, is the fact that we are making it easier for customers to pay on the App Store. Outside the United States, in many markets, not every form of payment is accepted. We are making it easier all the time. We launched on Alipay, for example, in China during the December quarter. That has obviously helped a lot with the growth in the number of paid accounts. And we continue to bring more and more forms of payment in the App Store around the world. That's a big reason for that. The other reason why the number of paying accounts is growing is the fact that the quality and the quantity of content continues to improve. And so there's many more ways of experiencing games and entertainment and other apps on the store. We have other businesses like the Apple Music streaming service, which is growing very fast because we just started it a couple of years ago, so we are getting a lot of new subscribers there. Our iCloud storage business continues to grow very, very fast. So it's multiple services. The number of people transacting on our stores continues to grow. In terms of ARPU, maybe I can make a comment on ARPU specifically related to the App Store. What we're seeing and we've seen over a long period of time as we keep track of these cohorts of customers, we see that as customers get on the App Store and start spending on it, we see the spending profile is very similar across generations of customers. People tend to spend more over time. Obviously, you have different spending profiles in different geographies around the world, but in general you see that trend across the board.\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it, that's really helpful. And if I could just follow up, on the iPhone side, there's been a large amount of discussion in blogs and among your component suppliers that the timing this time may be somewhat different and delayed versus past. Your guide almost seems you're more excited about this iPhone launch versus historically because the sequential growth is better. So I guess beyond the fact we probably shouldn't read every blog and believe every blog, what do you think is different with this product launch or product availability through the cycle versus what you've seen historically?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We have no comment on anything that's unannounced.\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Fair enough, I figured it was worth a shot. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Brian White with Drexel.\nBrian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Yes. Tim, growth in the smartphone market is now crawling along at about a low single digit percentage. I know iPhone grew about 2% year over year this quarter, and it looks like you had about a mid-teens market share in units in 2016. So as we look forward maybe three to four years, do you think Apple can expand its unit market share? And if so, what will be the drivers be? And my second question is just about India, general thoughts about India in the quarter. Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: The answer to your first question is yes. I do think that we can grow both in units and market share. We don't predict those things, but yes, if you ask me what I think, that's what I think. And so what are the drivers? The installed base is growing. It's still growing very strongly. That will generate more upgrades over time. I feel good about our ability to convince people to switch. And where the developed markets the first-time buyer rates are down other than places like Japan perhaps, the emerging markets, we haven't even gotten started yet, really. From a revenue point of view, we had very strong growth there. Emerging markets ex-China were up 18% year on year. It was a record for us, so we see a lot of opportunity in these markets. We are investing in India. As you mentioned in your second point, we've already launched an app accelerator center. That's on top of working with the channel and looking at expanding our go-to-market in general. And we began to produce the iPhone SE there during the quarter, and we're really happy with how that's going. And so we're bringing all of our energies to bear there. I see a lot of similarities to where China was several years ago. And so I'm very, very bullish and very, very optimistic about India.\nBrian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Great, thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks very much, Brian.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we are reporting strong March quarter results, with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great about this performance. Revenue was $52.9 billion, near the high end of our guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year on year, with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance. That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year. iPhone sales were line in line with our expectations, and we're thrilled to see the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large display and dual-camera system. Our active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits year over year. And based on the latest data from IDC, we gained market share in nearly every country we track. Late in the quarter, we released the stunning (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition versions of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our partnership with RED. This relationship has given our customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the global fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation. We've seen wonderful customer response to these eye-popping new iPhones. For the second quarter in a row, our Services revenue topped $7 billion, and it's well on the way to being the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services. App Store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year, and we're thrilled to see their success. We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third-party content we offer on our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million. Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the launch of Taiwan and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets with more than 20 million contactless-ready locations, including more than 4.5 million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone. We're seeing strong growing usage as points of acceptance expand, with transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months. In the UK, for example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year, while monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, where Apple Pay launched last October, more than 0.5 million transit users are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month. And we're always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift card via iMessage with just a touch. We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in Messages. In fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were sending 380,000 Messages per second, more than double the previous year. A few weeks ago, we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great example of how we're continually making our products even more engaging, and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, photos, and music on an iPhone or an iPad into great-looking expressive videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share your clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media. We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform. We also updated our most popular sized iPad with a brighter Retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever, and customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of our expectations, and we believe we gained share during the March quarter in a number of major markets, including the U.S., Japan, and Australia. iPad remains the world's most popular tablet, and it's the primary computing device for millions of customers across the globe. Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world, and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on their fitness and health. We're also seeing great response to AirPods, with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategy survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply, and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company. In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and Services during the March quarter. We also had great results from our retail stores in mainland China, with total store revenue up 27% over last year and comp store revenue up 7%. These results contributed to our improving performance in Greater China. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, our year-over-year comparisons improved significantly over the last two quarters of fiscal 2016. First half revenue was down 13% year over year, about a third of which was attributable to FX. That's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our expectations, and similar to the year-over-year performance we experienced in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China. We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure. Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the opening of our newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with employees who collectively speak 45 languages, and are already welcoming customers from around the world. As Luca will discuss in a moment, today we're also providing an update to our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're increasing the program size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, and we're extending the timeframe through March of 2019. We're adding to our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. We're very excited about our upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference taking place in San Jose next month. The conference is significantly oversubscribed, and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all four of our software platforms \u2013 iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS \u2013 that enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, health, and more. I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our 10th annual Environmental Responsibility Report, reflecting our amazing progress. In 2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, including all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done, but we're committed to leaving the world better than we found it. Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for innovation. The main building on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly talented teams. We have many more ongoing investments in the United States economy, since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America. Through our innovative products and the success of our business, we're incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states, and we expect to create even more. Last fiscal year, we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers, and partners, and we continue to invest confidently in our future. Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $52.9 billion, and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Our growth rates were even higher, over 20% in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand. Gross margin was 38.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. That's a sequential increase from 38.5% in the December quarter, which is particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points, and cost pressures on certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue and net income was $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10, an increase of 10% over last year, and cash flow from operations was strong at $12.5 billion. For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones, and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone performance was slightly better than last year on a sell-through basis. We had very solid iPhone growth in four of our five operating segments and experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East, and our Rest of Asia-Pacific segment, all areas of the world where iPhone sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago, thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our five to seven-week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with consumers but also with business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter. We're very happy with the strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year, as the busy week between Christmas and New Year's fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goal is to double the size of our Services business by 2020. The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year over year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying accounts was the largest that we've ever experienced. And according to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year over year and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year, compared to zero growth in the PC market according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units, which was ahead of our expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We are very pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenue growth worldwide for our 9.7-inch and larger iPads over the last four quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and we exited just below our five to seven-week target range. iPad remains very successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that range from 95% for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9-inch version. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68% for the June quarter. All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive more buying transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year. Recently, Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard smartphone, so 620,000 employees around the world have the opportunity to enjoy the best-in-class mobile experience that iPhone offers. And Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhones and iPads. We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners, who are helping us deliver long-lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus competing platforms. The Deloitte partnership is off to a great start, with more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different industries. SAP released the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS at the end of March, and over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop powerful iOS-native apps for the enterprise. The partnership with Cisco enables optimized performance of iOS devices over their networks and is generating a large and growing pipeline of sales opportunities across multiple verticals, including healthcare and financial services. And our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and innovation, with IBM Mobile First for iOS apps now in more than 3,300 client engagements. And with its Mobile at Scale offering, IBM recently closed an agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at Santander Bank to drive digital transformation. Our retail and online stores produced great results, with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores were up 16% over last year, and we added four new stores during the March quarter. And with the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 billion. $239.6 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We returned over $10 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of 31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 17.5 million shares. And we retired 6.3 million shares upon the completion of our ninth accelerated share repurchase program in February. All these activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 billion capital return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which we are extending by four quarters through March of 2019, and increasing in size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we are allocating the majority of the program expansion to share repurchases. Our board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $175 billion level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employees' restricted stock units. In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. As we know, this is very important to many of our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2017. With over $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price. We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current U.S. cash, future U.S. cash generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We'll also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our program. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $450 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Luca, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Rebecca, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thanks. My first question is for Luca around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market. And maybe if you can, comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. Let me take them one by one. Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially. And this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. So that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix shift towards Services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand, it's selling incredibly well. And this was a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there are supply constraints, and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was \u2013 wound up that demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter. What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learn to the next time.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color, especially as you're going through the year? And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic \u2013 which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell \u2013 traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve \u2013 but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have I think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come through?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. We've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From JPMorgan, Rod Hall.\nRod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. And then I have one follow-up to that. Thanks.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis.\nRod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow-up for Tim. Tim, I wanted to just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa.\nRod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thank you very much.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From UBS, Steve Milunovich.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do you see wearables: A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. We took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods. It's still very much in the ramping mode, and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look on the trailing 12 months \u2013 so this is not a forecast \u2013 that business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, four months, and so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that \u2013 it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. And then there was a \u2013 you mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple findings that were interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. And the other was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. But in general, what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know, but we are seeing that in full transparency.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thanks for the question.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi.\nA.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. I have two as well. First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risk to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe that a \u2013 I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not \u2013 it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for. And so we'll let it go with that.\nA.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter. And the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on, was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause? And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening, or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced? Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: There are a lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth. And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that is useful for you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thank you. I had a question for Luca first. Last year, you had a 4 million-unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just curious what you're expecting for this year just so we have an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about your guidance.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, and then just for Tim. Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, manufacturing, and R&D presence there. So just curious as you look at that market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, a lower priced iPhone. Do you think that say this next 12 \u2013 18 months is going be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil [Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quarter, and so there are a ton of things going on there. And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thanks so much for the detail. That's greatly appreciated.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Jim.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon everyone, and thanks very much for joining us. I'm very happy to share with you the outstanding results of Apple's December quarter. We generated the highest quarterly revenue in Apple's history along with all-time unit and revenue records for iPhone and Apple Watch, all-time revenue records for Services and Mac, and all-time revenue records for four out of our five geographic segments. The strong performance of our business also produced all-time record earnings per share. Revenue in the quarter was $78.4 billion, which was above the top of our guidance range. iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations. While iPhone 7 is our most popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we've ever seen with Plus models in the past. Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout the quarter, and we came into supply/demand balance in January. iPhone 7 Plus has earned rave reviews for its advanced new features, especially the dual camera system, which produces stunning portraits and high-quality zoom. This is a uniquely Apple feature that is surprising and delighting our users. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are empowering our customers to be more productive, more engaged, and more expressive than ever by integrating hardware, software, and services to create experiences that only Apple can deliver. It was our best quarter ever for Services, with almost $7.2 billion in revenue. App Store customers broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever. Our innovative and vibrant developer community has created over 2.2 million apps for doing almost anything that you can imagine. Apple's developer community has now earned over $60 billion, including over $20 billion in 2016 alone. Revenue from our music business grew for the third quarter in a row, and our AppleCare and iPlus storage services had all-time record results. Apple Pay continued its strong momentum, with the number of users more than tripling over the past year and hundreds of millions of transactions and billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone. Transaction volume was up over 500% year over year as we expanded to four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain, bringing us into a total of 13 markets. Apple Pay on the Web is delivering our partners great results. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting invoice payments with Apply Pay through Intuit QuickBooks Online, FreshBooks, and other billing partners. And beginning this quarter, Comcast customers can pay their monthly bill in a single touch with Apple Pay. Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our Services offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own services and third-party content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the size of our Services business in the next four years. The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our latest data shows that most Mac customers are buying their first Mac, with the vast majority of them coming from a Windows PC. The new MacBook Touch with Touch Bar is an outstanding example of the innovation made possible by integrating world-class hardware and software. We were supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and are just now coming into supply/demand balance. It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved, with the highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it is the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch. We're also thrilled with the response to AirPods. Customers love the magical experience AirPods are delivering. And if you haven't tried them yet, you'll be delighted when you do. They're far ahead of anything else on the market today, and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible demand. With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Watch, and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products. Their design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward. Our ecosystem is broadening to more and more of the areas where people spend their time, at the gym, on the go, in the home, and on the job. For example, every major automaker is committed to supporting CarPlay with over 200 different models announced, including five of the top 10 selling models in the United States. There are well over 1 million people using CarPlay now, and this continues to grow rapidly. And we are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. With Siri and a new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch. The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water leaks. Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors, and alarm systems. I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine. Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors. When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit. We're making great progress in the enterprise market alongside our major partners. The combination of iOS and Cisco technology is giving companies everywhere the opportunity to vastly improve the user experience for their mobile employees. With enhanced networking performance, up to eight times faster roaming, better reliability for apps, and native voice experience, we're excited about how much more productive the workforce will be with these great capabilities. In fact, the total number of joint customer opportunities has grown over 70% since last quarter. Enterprises are using IBM's new Mobile at Scale design and development model to deploy multiple iOS apps with speed and efficiency. For example, Finnair is transforming aircraft maintenance, and CEMEX is revamping activities from attracting new clients to invoicing to after-sales support. And later this spring, SAP will be rolling out its SDK for iOS, providing its community of more than 2.5 million developers the tools to build powerful native iOS apps that leverage the SAP HANA cloud platform. We're delighted with how these partnerships are making it even easier for enterprise customers to transform how work gets done with iOS. As we reflect on a record-breaking December quarter, I'd like to thank our developers, our business partners, and our employees for their incredible contributions and commitment. And I'd like to thank all of our customers around the world for their excitement and loyalty, which ultimately drive these results. Now I'd like to turn it over to Luca to talk about the quarter in more detail.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $78.4 billion, the highest quarterly revenue in the history of Apple and above our guidance range. As Tim mentioned, the strength of our results was very broad-based, as we set new revenue records for iPhone, for Services, for Mac, and for Apple Watch. We also established new all-time revenue records in most developed and emerging markets, with strong growth rates in many countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia. We accomplished all this despite a very challenging foreign exchange environment due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As we had expected, our year-over-year performance in Greater China improved significantly relative to the September quarter. Total Greater China segment revenue was down 12%, but revenue from Mainland China was even with the all-time record results from a year ago and grew in constant currency terms. In all other geographic segments, we generated all-time quarterly record results. We had the benefit of a 14th week during the quarter this year, but this was offset by four factors. First, this year we grew China inventory significantly less than a year ago. Second, iPhone 7 launched earlier in the September quarter compared to the iPhone 6s launch the previous year, creating a more difficult comparison for the December quarter this year. Third, the stronger U.S. dollar affected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis points. And fourth, our year-ago revenue included the benefit of a one-off $548 million patent infringement payment. Also, strong customer interest left us in supply/demand imbalance for several of our products throughout the quarter this year. Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue, and net income was $17.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $3.36, a new all-time record, and cash flow from operations was $27.1 billion. We had a terrific quarter for iPhone as we sold 78.3 million units, a new all-time record and an increase of 5% over last year. Customer demand was even higher than our reported results, as iPhone unit sell-through was up 8%. We saw double-digit iPhone growth in the U.S., in Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia, and even stronger growth in many emerging markets, including Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Vietnam. iPhone ASP increased to $695 in the December quarter from $619 in the September quarter, driven by the very strong product mix and the amazing success of iPhone 7 Plus. Despite stronger demand than last year, we added only 1.2 million units of iPhone channel inventory across the quarter, significantly less than the increase of 3.3 million units a year ago. And we exited the quarter near the low end of our 5 to 7-week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are exceptional, not only with consumers, but also with business users. In the U.S., for instance, the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 97% customer satisfaction rating among all iPhone owners and a 99% satisfaction rating for owners of iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the iPhone customer satisfaction rating was 94%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $7.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year. Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago. The App Store continued its impressive run, breaking all previous revenue records. Year-over-year App Store revenue growth was 43% through the first 13 weeks of the quarter. It's great to see that both average revenue per paying account and the number of paying accounts grew strongly during the quarter. And according to App Annie's latest report, App Store revenue continues to outpace the industry overall, with more than double the revenue of Google Play in calendar 2016. Next I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.4 million Macs and generated our highest-ever quarterly Mac revenue. We were very happy to report double-digit unit growth in several countries, including Japan, Mainland China, India, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as in the U.S. education market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our 4 to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 13.1 million units, which was ahead of our expectations. And we posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and India, as we've expanded distribution channels in those countries and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers. We also reduced channel inventory by about 700,000 units as opposed to an increase of 900,000 units last year, and we exited the quarter near the low end of our five to seven-week target range. iPad is incredibly successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete, both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in November, 451 Research measured a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Mini, a 97% rate for iPad Air, and 96% for iPad Pro. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad is more than four times higher than any other brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 66% for the March quarter. In fact, businesses of all sizes are choosing iPad and iPhone to have them reimagine their everyday activities. We're seeing strong momentum in sectors such as retail, where iOS solutions are being deployed for everything from product development to logistics to mobile point-of-sale. Companies like Toys \"R\" Us, Coach, and Kate Spade are using iOS and our mobility partner solutions to dramatically transform their customer and employee experiences. Our retail stores experienced strong double-digit growth in visitors and revenue in the December quarter. And we continued to expand our global presence, with plans to open our first store in Singapore and our second store in Dubai soon. We are continually updating our stores and adding new and exciting outreach programs to educate kids on our products, entertain the community with fresh live music, teach future Swift developers to code, and empower entrepreneurs to start, grow, and evolve their businesses. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $246.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $8.5 billion. $230.2 billion of this cash or 94% of the total was outside the United States. We also had $77.1 billion in term debt and $10.5 billion in commercial paper outstanding at quarter end. We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares. We also completed our eighth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 4.4 million shares. This led to a net diluted share count reduction of 65.3 million shares during the quarter. We've now completed $201 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $144 billion in share repurchases. And we plan to provide investors with our annual update on the capital return program in the spring. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, as expected. And as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. This guidance range includes a $1.2 billion year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. This guidance range includes an 80 basis points sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We expect OpEx to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend up $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on February 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2017. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen the gross margin guidance for the March quarter? And what are the one or two factors that put you at the low end versus the tailwinds that might put you at the high end of that range? And then I have a follow-up, thank you.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Sure, Katy. If you look back at our history, 100 basis points range for gross margin is not unusual. Clearly during a period when foreign exchange is very volatile, we think it's more prudent to broaden the range a bit. I've mentioned that we expect \u2013 assuming that rates don't move too much, we expect foreign exchange to be a major negative as we move from the December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar has appreciated significantly toward the end of the December quarter, and so we've got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also have the sequential loss of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to offset these two impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our mix of products and services. So obviously if the dollar is a little less strong than it is today, we could do a bit better on gross margins. Obviously, we continue to work very hard on our cost efficiency, so we'll see where we land.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. And, Tim, there's a reasonable probability that you may get access to the $200 billion-plus of cash that's been locked overseas. So I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&A and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in the past like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing. Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Katy, I am optimistic given what I'm hearing that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there are people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is. But as I said before, we are always looking at acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the last four years. And we look for companies of all sizes, and there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it. It's more about the strategic value of it. In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down is, one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it but it's come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there are a number of third-party services that are a part of that, where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform in selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously, with our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that. Thanks for the question.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess the first question, I really appreciate the information you guys are providing around your Services business, which is up 18% year over year. Can you just talk about? How much of that do you think is growth in your installed base versus increased monetization on a per iOS to iOS basis? And so we are to think about those in two separate tranches?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: I think you're absolutely right, Amit. We look at it that those are the two key elements for us. And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double-digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is increasing double digits, right. So it's a combination of the two. Obviously, the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our services improves all the time. And we also see that as people getting to the platform and start transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. And that's why we are excited about the future of the Services business. And that's why, as Tim said, we have a goal that \u2013 it's already become a very large business. It's going to be a Fortune 100 company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next four years.\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Perfect. And if I could just switch gears on a follow-up, there has been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what's happening over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. So could you just talk about what are the demand trends you're seeing there on the ground, and how do you see that transpire through the year?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take this one. If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12%, and about 4 points of that was currency related, so it's an 8 point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China, if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. And if you look at that on a constant currency basis, it was actually up 6%. So it's a significantly better performance on every way you look at it versus what we had experienced the prior three quarters. Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter, according to Kantar. Singles Day, which is a huge day in China, as you know, we were the most popular U.S. brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for Services in China, as the company did. And Mac revenue was up double digit year over year. iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China, which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with. And obviously, our total installed base continues to grow there in the strong double digits. That said, the challenges that are there are, one, the currency has devalued 6% year over year. And two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. And so I look at it in \u2013 I'm encouraged with the significant improvement, but we're not without challenges there. And I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how broad-based the pluses were across our product line.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Cross Research, Shannon Cross.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the Services business? And what I'm trying to figure out is I think the number was you're going to be doubling within the next four years, at least that's your expectation. So what gets you there? I don't know, maybe if you talk about geographies and how penetrated you are in certain geographies. And then, as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower margin services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and the contribution to the bottom line.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, Shannon, I'll take it. Obviously, within the Services business, we have a number of categories. The App Store is the one that is driving significant growth right now. I said in my opening comments that we grew 43% 13 weeks over 13 weeks, a little even more for the quarter, right. And what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform. So we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets, where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China, for example. And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better. We can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets. And so as we look, as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth. On the music front, we are the market leader in digital music. Obviously now, by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service, which we didn't have until recently, we've been able to bring our music business back to growth. We've grown over the last three quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original content. We've had very good success with exclusives. So we know that it's another business that we can grow. Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that is a business that also at a geographic level we can continue to grow significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, strong double digits. And as we've explained in the past, the vast majority of the services that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days. It's much more driven by the install base, and that gives us a tailwind. We're also opening up several new markets because we are accepting new forms of payment. And therefore, it's easier particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services. You were asking about the margin profile. We said many times, in aggregate our Services business tends to have margins that are above company average. They are accretive, so they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. Within the Services business, we have very different margin profiles, also because, as you know, we account for some of these services in different ways. In some cases, we transact on a buy/sell basis. In other cases, we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, and that drives different margin percentages.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you. And then my follow-up is just in terms of the elasticity of demand and some of the moves from a currency perspective. I think in the past there was some concern in some of the emerging markets the you were basically not able to \u2013 you weren't you're getting the volumes because you had to raise ASPs given the currency. But you talked about a lot of the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. So I'm just curious. You raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus and that. What are you seeing, and what are your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay up?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Shannon, I was looking back. Since June of 2014, so we're talking about 2.5 years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. And so obviously, it is a difficult situation for us. I've mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it's incredible. The level of interest for our products continues to be phenomenal. The brand continues to be very aspirational. There are more and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly the strong dollar doesn't help us. And therefore, when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Moving on, we'll hear from Brian White with Drexel.\nBrian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Luca, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. Sales obviously beat the high end of your revenue range. It looks like gross margin was dead down the middle. Can you talk about the puts and takes in gross margins in the quarter, please?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Sure. We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins. We had guided 38% to 38.5%, and we came in at 38.5% exactly. And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels. We felt very good about the gross margins for the quarter. Again, keep in mind the strong dollar doesn't help us on that front.\nBrian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC: Okay. And, Tim, I didn't hear much mentioned about India. How did India perform with the iPhone? And how should we think about it for 2017, especially with the 4G network going up?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: That's a really good question. Despite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that. The demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet. It's still definitely having some overhang. But I think in the longer term, it's a great move, and I feel really good about how we're doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Simona Jankowski.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, thank you. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter with record revenues in every region except for Greater China. I think you touched on the percent of switchers in China. But can you give a little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other regions and overall as well?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Simona, it's Tim. We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well on the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter. And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year. However, I think the big asterisk \u2013 I share all this with you for transparency's sake. I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. But I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the backdrop.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you, and then just one follow-up on China specifically. As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region. And then just to give us the context, I know you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in Mainland China. But curious if you strip out the double-digit increase in iPad and MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the iPhone 7 Plus, I'm curious what underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: That's a big question, and I don't have the answer in front of me. If you look at iPhone 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had. It set a unit record, so that I can share. In terms of how are we going to do, we don't provide guidance at the segment level. But sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. The real comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it.\nSimona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics. So I think iPhone units on a sell-through basis were up about 8%. You had an extra week, which gave you about 8%. I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch. So making all those adjustments, it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But, Luca, you alluded to the fact that your install base was growing double digits. So that would suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is actually declining. And more specifically, I'd just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates. It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they've been extending \u2013 going lower. Replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple years. I think some of the U.S. carriers alluded to that as well. So I'm wondering if you could step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about or what the trajectory has been over the last two years and how investors should think going forward. Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the considerations we should think about?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: I think it's a good question, a number of points that I want to make. Starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones, yes, it's growing strong double digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business. When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate. But when we look at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, where for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. Same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia but also many places in Western Europe as well. Japan grew double digits in terms of units. So I think geographically we are seeing very, very good performance. The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States, where we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? And you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously that doesn't help us. But overall, I would say as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, right, the new generation phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we've seen last year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones. And certainly as we look ahead, we have a role to play. The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you. Tim, I have a question for you. Back in April 2012, you said on one of these earnings calls that I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle. Yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I'm wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, and what would be a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I feel the same way I did in April of 2012. I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate. And so it's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld $1 billion in payments that they owed us. And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it. In terms of where it goes, we'll see. I don't like litigation. And so if there's another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don't see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is. And so that's the way I see it. Thanks for your question.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the iPad. It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive. You said it was above your plan, but I think it was pretty well below the Street's expectations. And the ASP deteriorated pretty significantly. I don't know if it's a mix shift. But maybe you can talk about the iPad and what you see going forward.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit swing on channel inventory between the years. In the year-ago quarter we increased by 900,000. In this quarter we decreased by 700,000. On top of that and from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there. If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning. And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. And so it will damper this quarter somewhat. But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, that's great, thank you. And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the iPhone as mature and technology improvements as incremental, yet I believe you said there's plenty of runway left in terms of appealing new features. Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed as material by users, and particularly changes beyond form factor, beyond the way the phone looks? Are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think there's lots more to do. I think it's become \u2013 every year it becomes more important to people's lives and there are more things people are doing with it. I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health. I could have talked more about CarPlay. The use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly. And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. So this is one that we think different about a bunch of things, but maybe this is just one more.\nSteven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Steve.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon everyone, and thanks for joining us. I just got back from Brooklyn, where we marked our fourth major launch event of the year. In addition to being a great time, it put an exclamation point at the end of a remarkable fiscal 2018. This year, we shipped our 2 billionth iOS device, celebrated the 10th anniversary of the App Store, and achieved the strongest revenue and earnings in Apple's history. In fiscal year 2018, our revenue grew by $36.4 billion. That's the equivalent of a Fortune 100 company in a single year, and we're capping all that off with our best September quarter ever. Revenue was $62.9 billion, ahead of our expectations. That's an increase of 20% over last year and our highest growth rate in three years. We also generated record Q4 earnings with 41% year-over-year growth in EPS. Record results from iPhone, services, and wearables drove our momentum and we produced strong double-digit revenue growth in all of our geographic segments. It was a big year and a big quarter for iPhone. Q4 revenue was up 29% over last year, an increase of over $8 billion to a new September quarter record fueled by continued momentum for iPhone 8, 8 Plus and X, and the very successful launch of iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. These latest devices are our most advanced iPhones ever with the industry's first 7-nanometer A12 Bionic chip with an Apple designed 8-core Neural Engine capable of executing an astounding 5 trillion operations per second. The A12 Bionic is many years in the making and a huge technological leap forward. It sets the iPhone experience far apart from the competition, using real-time machine learning to transform the way we experience photos, gaming, augmented reality and more. It makes full use of the dual camera system that shoots portrait mode photos with Smart HDR and dynamic depth of field and Face ID is even faster. The response has been powerful. As one reviewer put it, iPhone XS and XS Max are the perfect blend of design and craftsmanship, as well as seamlessly intuitive user experience. We're not done yet. Just last week, we began shipping iPhone XR, bringing the latest iPhone breakthroughs to even more users. With an all-screen glass and aluminum design and the most advanced LCD in a smartphone, the product reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. iOS 12 has gotten off to an incredible start. It's been installed on more systems in its first month than any version of iOS ever. iOS 12 is delivering system-wide performance enhancements, Siri Shortcuts, and new tools to help people reduce interruptions and manage screen time for themselves and their kids. Siri Shortcuts in particular is already deeply integrated with some of the most popular apps out there. Whether you're tracking your workouts or rushing to catch a flight, you can be sure all of your most relevant apps are working together with Siri in the driver seat. iOS 12 also features ARKit 2, a major upgrade to our augmented reality engine. ARKit 2 makes possible simultaneous multi-user experiences and real-world object incorporation. Our developer community is really running with this technology. From gaming to shopping, we're seeing great new use cases emerge. iOS devices deliver the best AR experiences of any products in the market today and with the announcement of our new iPad Pro this week, we've made that gap even wider. More powerful than the vast majority of PC laptops, the new iPad Pro is unrivalled in its versatility and performance. When paired with the beautifully refined Apple Pencil and a new streamlined full-size Smart Keyboard, iPad Pro will extend its lead as the ultimate creativity and productivity device. And finally, just this week, we delivered the highly anticipated Group FaceTime functionality to all FaceTime-enabled devices. For services, it was our best quarter ever with revenue at $10 billion. Excluding the impact of a favorable one-time accounting adjustment of $640 million a year ago, our services growth was 27%. We set new Q4 records in all of our geographic segments and new all-time revenue records for the App Store, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Music and Apple Pay. We also continued to see strong growth in paid subscriptions reaching over 330 million in our ecosystem. I want to spotlight the exceptional performance at Apple Pay, which is by far the number one mobile contactless payment service worldwide. Transaction volume tripled year-over-year. And to put that into perspective, Apple Pay generated significantly more transactions than even PayPal Mobile with over 4 times the growth rate. As a testament to accelerating U.S. growth, Costco completed the rollout of Apple Pay to over 500 U.S. warehouses last quarter, while Neiman Marcus is now accepting Apple Pay at over 40 stores across the country. With these additions, 71 of the top 100 merchants and 60% of all U.S. retail locations support Apple Pay. We continue to invest in our strategy to replace the wallet with the recent launch of student ID passes at several major U.S. universities. And 10 months following its launch, Apple Pay Cash is the highest-rated mobile peer-to-peer service by Consumer Reports, based on exceptional payment authentication and data privacy. We set an all-time quarterly record for Mac revenue, thanks to strong performance in MacBook Pro and the impact of the back-to-school season. In September, we delivered macOS Mojave, bringing powerful new features to Mac like Dark Mode, Stacks and a completely redesigned Mac App Store. Consider alongside the release of iOS 12, WatchOS 5 and a new tvOS, macOS Mojave tells a powerful story of the seamless integration of world-class hardware, software and services that define the Apple ecosystem. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, earlier this week we announced exciting updates to the Mac lineup. The all-new MacBook Air brings a stunning Retina display, Touch ID, the latest processors and an even more portable design to the world's most beloved notebook. We also unveiled the biggest update ever to Mac mini, the small yet muscular desktop that powers everything from the music and sound effects at Broadway shows to the developers who build some of the most popular apps in the App Store. The new Mac mini boasts an amazing 5 times faster performance than before. With revenue growth over 50%, it was another record quarter for wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. With the highest customer satisfaction in the industry, Apple Watch has become an essential part of people's lives. The customer response to the Apple Watch Series 4 has been overwhelmingly positive, driven by its all-new design, larger display, faster performance, fall detection, enhanced cellular reception and electrical heart sensor. Later this year, the ECG App will be available to Apple Watch Series 4 customers in the U.S., giving them the ability to take an electrocardiogram any time, right from their wrist. And for U.S. customers with Apple Watch Series 1 and later, WatchOS will soon enable periodic checks for irregular heart rhythms that may be suggestive of AFib. These are unprecedented and potentially life-changing features, showing how Apple Watch is not only an indispensable communication and fitness companion but also an intelligent guardian for your health. More broadly, we see this as just one further example of the kind of contribution we can make in the health space and we look forward to making more in the future. We are proud to bring HomePod to new customers. I was in Spain last week as HomePod became available there and in Mexico. HomePod delivers the highest fidelity audio quality, working together with an Apple Music subscription to stream over 50 million songs into any room of your home. Our retail team posted record Q4 results to conclude their biggest year ever. They are transforming our stores into places where customers come to connect, learn, and be inspired together with people from their community. Our Today at Apple sessions are a terrific example of what that looks like in practice. We hosted over 250,000 Today at Apple sessions this quarter, connecting aspiring creators with local photographers, illustrators, and other experts who can help them get the most out of their devices. Apple Stores also hosted 74,000 kids at Apple Camp. The relationship Apple has with our customers is about more than just making a purchase. With the recent addition of beautiful new stores in Italy, Japan, China, and in just a few weeks, Thailand, we will have 506 stores where we can further those relationships, almost half of which are outside the United States. Before I turn the call over to Luca, I'd like to touch on two items that may not show up in our financial statement but are just as integral to Apple's mission and our commitment to making the world a better place. First education, more than 5,000 schools, community colleges, and technical colleges worldwide are now using Everyone Can Code, our free coding curriculum. Ideas, creativity, and passion for technology's potential aren't limited by zip code or country, and we don't think opportunity should be either. We're also excited that educators in more than 350 schools around the world have started working with Everyone Can Create, the free collection of tools and project guides we introduced this spring, designed to help unleash kids' creativity throughout their school day with the help of iPad. Next is the environment. This was a milestone year for Apple's commitment to our planet. In April, we announced that 100% of our global operations are powered by renewable energy. We also made progress in doing the same in our supply chain. And just this week, we announced that the enclosures of new products like MacBook Air and iPad Pro will be made from 100% recycled aluminum, a strong, durable, and beautiful new alloy designed by Apple. This is a great example of how a commitment to do right on the issues that matter can drive once unimaginable innovation, new ways of approaching old problems, and beautiful solutions that set us apart. I'd like to thank all of our employees, customers, developers, and business partners for helping us deliver outstanding results across our fiscal 2018. We are headed into the holidays with our strongest product lineup ever, and we could not be more bullish about Apple's future. And now, Luca has more details to share with you on the September quarter. Luca?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our September quarter, which capped a tremendously successful fiscal 2018, a year in which we saw double-digit revenue growth in every geographic segment and established new revenue and earnings records in every single quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $62.9 billion, up 20% and more than $10 billion over last year, with strong double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments and record Q4 revenue in the Americas, in Europe, Japan, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. In fact, we set new revenue records in almost every market we track, with especially strong growth in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan, and Korea, all major markets where revenue growth was 25% or higher. We also set new fourth quarter revenue records for iPhone and wearables and new all-time records for services and Mac. Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially, in line with our expectations, as leverage from higher revenue offset seasonal transition costs. We set new September quarter records for net income, EPS, and cash flow from operations. Net income was $14.1 billion, up $3.4 billion or 32% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.91, up 41%. Cash flow from operations was $19.5 billion, up $3.8 billion from a year ago. iPhone revenue grew 29% with growth of more than 20% in every geographic segment. iPhone ASP was $793 compared to $618 a year ago, driven by strong performance of iPhone X, 8 and 8 Plus, as well as the successful launch of iPhone XS and XS Max in the September quarter this year, while we launched iPhone X in the December quarter last year. We sold 46.9 million iPhones during the quarter, with growth of 20% or more in several markets, including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway, Chile, and Vietnam. Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone X, 8, and 8 Plus combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 80% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to services, it was our best quarter ever in total and virtually in every market around the world, with revenue of $10 billion. A year ago, we had a one-time $640 million favorable impact to services revenue due to an accounting adjustment. And taking that into account, our services growth in Q4 this year was 27%. As Tim mentioned, we reached new all-time quarterly revenue records for many services categories, and we are well on our way to achieve our goal to double our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. We now have over 330 million paid subscriptions on our platform, an increase of over 50% versus a year ago. We are very pleased not only with the growth but also with the breadth of our subscription business. In fact, 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available on the App Store today, and the largest of them all represents less than 0.3% of our total services revenue. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to our new MacBook Pro models that we launched in July, with strong double-digit revenue growth driving an all time quarterly record for Mac revenue. We were especially pleased with Mac momentum in emerging markets, with strong growth in Latin America, in India, the Middle East and Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe. At over 100 million units, our active installed base of Macs is at an all-time high, and the majority of customers purchasing Macs in the September quarter were new to Mac. We sold 9.7 million iPads during the quarter, gaining share in nearly every market we track, based on the latest estimates from IDC. We generated iPad growth in a number of key regions around the world, including Latin America, Europe, Japan, India, and South Asia. Among customers around the world purchasing iPads during the quarter, nearly half were new to iPad, and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high. NPD indicates that iPad had 58% share of the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter, up from 54% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 96% for both iPad and iPad Pro. And among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter, 74% plan to purchase iPads. Other products revenue grew 31% to a new September quarter record with an increase of over $1 billion compared to a year ago thanks to wearables growth of over 50% and the strong performance of Apple TV, in addition to the introduction of HomePod earlier this year. As we look back across fiscal 2018, we've made great progress in the enterprise market, where iOS is transforming how business gets done across multiple industries. In fact, over 450 airlines and 47 of the top 50 around the world have adopted iOS to help pilots fly saver, more efficient flights and many airlines are also using iOS to support better customer experiences and improve maintenance operations. We're also making great strides in the retail sector, where 9 of the top 10 global retailers use iOS devices to transform their customer and employee experiences. We're seeing industry-wide adoption of iOS at thousands of retailers from neighborhood boutiques to many of the best-known retailers in the world. Deployment of iOS devices is growing steadily as retailers replace their traditional point-of-sale systems and use custom iOS apps on iPhones and iPads to provide highly personalized shopping experiences. Our success in enterprise is supported by our key partnerships. Since launching our first strategic partnership with IBM, 240 large customers have signed MobileFirst for iOS deals. Additionally, earlier in the year we introduced two new technology offerings. IBM Watson services for Core ML, and the IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple that are enabling businesses to combine machine learning and cloud for a new generation of dynamic smart apps made for iOS. Over 60 new signings across numerous industries have been added since launching these new tools. In our new partnership with Salesforce, we're excited to bring together the number one customer relationship management platform and iOS. Together with Apple, Salesforce is redesigning its apps to embrace a native mobile platform with exclusive new features on iOS. The companies will also provide tools and resources for millions of Salesforce developers to build their own native apps with a new Salesforce mobile SDK for iOS. And finally, we recently announced Apple Business Manager, a new way for IT teams to deploy Apple devices at scale. The response from companies around the world has been tremendous with over 40,000 companies currently enrolled. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.5 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $122.6 billion. As explained earlier this year, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $23 billion to investors during quarter. We repurchased 92.5 million Apple shares for $19.4 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. For our fiscal year 2018, revenue grew over $36 billion to $265.6 billion, an all-time record. Every geographic segment grew double digits with new records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also set new all-time records for net income, up 23% versus last year, and EPS up 29%. And we returned a total of almost $90 billion to our investors during the year, including almost $14 billion in dividends and equivalents and over $73 billion in share repurchases. Before we discuss our December quarter outlook, I'd like to describe a number of changes in our financial reporting that we're implementing as we enter our new fiscal year. First, given the increasing importance of our services business and in order to provide additional transparency to our financial results, we will start reporting revenue as well as cost of sales for both total products and total services beginning this December quarter. Second, also beginning in this December quarter, we're adopting the FASB's new standard for revenue recognition. This will not result in any change to our total revenue, but it will impact the way we report the classification of revenue between products and services. In particular, the revenue corresponding to the amortization of the deferred value of bundled services such as Maps, Siri, and free iCloud services was previously reported in product revenue. After adopting the new standard, this revenue will now be reported in services revenue. The change in classification between products and services will also apply to the costs that are associated with the delivery of such bundled services. After we file our 10-K, we will post a schedule to our Investor Relations website showing the reclassification of fiscal 2018 revenue from products to services in connection with the adoption of the new standard. The size of this reclassification amounts to less than 1% of total company revenue. And for clarity, this reclassification was not contemplated in our previously stated goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. That goal remains unchanged and excludes the revenue that is now shifting from products to services over that timeframe. Third, starting with the December quarter, we will no longer be providing unit sales data for iPhone, iPad and Mac. As we have stated many times, our objective is to make great products and services that enrich people's lives, and to provide an unparalleled customer experience so that our users are highly satisfied, loyal and engaged. As we accomplish these objectives, strong financial results follow. As demonstrated by our financial performance in recent years, the number of units sold in any 90-day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. Furthermore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us today than it was in the past, given the breadth of our portfolio and the wider sales price dispersion within any given product line. Fourth, starting with the December quarter, we will be renaming the other products category to wearables, home, and accessories to provide a more accurate description of the items that are included in this product category. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We have the strongest lineup ever as we enter the holiday season and we expect revenue to be between $89 billion and $93 billion, a new all-time record. This range reflects a number of factors to be considered. First, we considered the effect on Q4 and Q1 of the launch timing of our new iPhones this year versus last year. Second, we expect almost $2 billion of foreign exchange headwinds. Third, we have an unprecedented number of products ramping, and while our ramps are going fairly well, we have uncertainty around supply and demand balance. And fourth, we also face some macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in emerging markets. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% before discrete items. Also today, our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on November 15, 2018 to shareholders of record as of November 12, 2018. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Luca, and we'd like to ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nWamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes. Thank you. Tim, there has been some real deceleration in some of these emerging markets, partly driven by some concerns around some of the rules the administration is contemplating and partly driven by things that are more specific to China, for instance, like some of the regulations around gaming. So can you talk about how you see the trajectory there for the business and what you think of the initiatives of some companies like Netflix and Fortnite trying to bypass the App Store around subscriptions and I have a follow-up.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Sure. Great question. Starting with emerging markets. The emerging markets that we're seeing pressure in are markets like Turkey, India, Brazil, Russia. These are markets where currencies have weakened over the recent period. In some cases, that resulted in us raising prices and those markets are not growing the way we would like to see. To give you a perspective in of some detail, our business in India in Q4 was flat. Obviously, we would like to see that be a huge growth. Brazil was down somewhat compared to the previous year. And so I think, or at least the way that I see these, is each one of the emerging markets has a bit of a different story, and I don't see it as some sort of issue that is common between those for the most part. In relation to China specifically, I would not put China in that category. Our business in China was very strong last quarter. We grew 16%, which we're very happy with. iPhone in particular was very strong, very strong double-digit growth there. Our other products category was also stronger, in fact, a bit stronger than even the overall company number. The App Store in China, we have seen a slowdown or a moratorium, to be more accurate, on new game approvals. There is a new regulatory setup in China, and there things are not moving the way they were moving previously. We did see a few games approved recently, but it's very far below the historic pace. And as you've probably seen, some of the larger companies there that are public have talked about this as they've announced their earnings as well. We don't know exactly when this will \u2013 the approvals will return to a normal pace, so I would not want to predict that. I do not view \u2013 just for avoidance of doubt here, I don't view that that issue has anything to do with the trade-related discussions between the countries. I think that is strictly a domestic issue in China. In terms of larger developers, if you step back and look at the value proposition for people from the App Store, there are two key constituencies in that equation. There's the user and there's the developer. If you start with the user, what the App Store provides people is the best and safest place for users to get apps. And we have a tremendous process and infrastructure around achieving that. And where it is not perfect, we wind up reviewing over 100,000 apps per week between new apps and updates for existing apps, and then work with developers quickly to fix the issues. And we also provide the user a one-payment model for purchasing apps and subscriptions and in-app purchases, et cetera, so that they are not in a position that they have to share their private information across many companies. And so that's the proposition for the user. For the developer, we obviously provide the developers a tremendous amount of developer tools, programs, compilers, languages, of course the operating system, APIs, SDKs, and have a huge developer relations team. And we do a tremendous amount of marketing for developers, including the new Today Editorial that we just started in the past few months, personal recommendations, search tools, and so on and so forth. And so there will be \u2013 there's no doubt in my mind there have already been some large developers that concluded that they could do something on their own. We're fine with that. I think Luca mentioned in his comments that the largest \u2013 if I look at the largest developer, they make up less than 0.3% of the services revenue, so it's probably good to think about that in that context, and there are millions of apps on the store obviously, and 30,000 or so subscription apps. And so the subscription business itself is nearly as broad as the App Store itself is, and so that's the value proposition. I think that the vast majority of people are very happy with it, including the most important people at all, which is the user.\nWamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you, Tim. I appreciate the response.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah.\nWamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: If I could just ask you really quick on Apple's role in healthcare, it's been growing significantly since the early introduction in the Watch and then the various kits for developers, including HealthKit, CareKit, et cetera. And when you combine that with your very staunch advocacy for privacy, I see Apple could become a really large disintermediating force in all the friction in the healthcare industry today in the way medical information is shared and distributed. Is this the way that you see the future for Apple in healthcare? And do you see a means to also grow your services business through the healthcare offerings that could become subscriptions to your customers? Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I think Apple has a huge opportunity in health. And you can see from our past several years that we have an intense interest in the space and are adding products and services, non-monetized services, so far to that. And I don't want to talk about the future because I don't want to give away what we're doing, but this is an area of major interest to us. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Shannon Cross from Cross Research has the next question.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much for taking the question. Given the $4 billion range in revenue that you're giving for the quarter and all the things that are going on in the world right now, can you maybe give a little detail about the variables that you took into account when you were coming up with this? Geopolitical trade, macro, component costs, I don't know if you can just give us some ideas of what the puts and takes were. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes, Shannon, I'll take this one. At the revenue level, we started from the fact that we are very, very excited about the lineup of products and services that we have getting into the holiday season. It's the strongest lineup that we've ever had. And our guidance range, by the way, represents a new all-time quarterly revenue record. As I explained in my prepared remarks, there are a number of things that need to be considered as part of this guidance range. The first one is the fact that the launch timing of the new iPhones this year is essentially in reverse order versus last year, and that has had an effect on Q4 and will have an effect on Q1. Last year, we launched the top end of our iPhone lineup, which was iPhone X, during Q1 and placed the entirety of the channel fill for iPhone X in Q1. This year, we launched the top end of the lineup, which is the XS and the XS Max during Q4. Obviously, this resulted in more pronounced ASP growth in Q4 of 2018 and obviously a tougher compare for Q1. So I think it's important to keep that in mind as you look at the revenue guidance that we provided. The second point that needs to be kept in mind, it is a fact of life and we dealt with it for a number of years now, is the fact that when I look at currencies around the world, virtually every foreign currency has depreciated against the U.S. dollar in the last 12 months. And when we look at the impact of foreign exchange on our revenue for the December quarter, we're looking at 200 basis points of headwinds which translates, given our the size of our business, to almost $2 billion of headwind to our revenue. The third point that I think it's important to keep in mind, and Tim has talked about this, we are launching, in the last six weeks, we've launched an unprecedented number of new products. They're all ramping right now. The ramps are going fairly well, but obviously we have some uncertainty around supply/demand balance for some of these products. And then finally, the last point that we've taken into account is what Tim's talked about in terms of some level of uncertainty at the macroeconomic level in some emerging markets where clearly consumer confidence is not as high as it was 12 months ago. So take that into account and that's how we got to the range.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then, I just want to talk a little bit about the pullback in terms of guidance from a unit perspective. I understand you don't want to give guidance because of 90 days is a short period of time and it can fluctuate, but what kind of qualitative commentary do you think you'll be able to provide? Because it's obviously investors have spent the last however many years going P times Q. So, how should we think about what we can expect and sort of how are you going to manage this process as we go through? I know it's all our job to forecast, but.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes. Let me walk you through the rationale that we've used and then I'll talk about this qualitative commentary that you were mentioning. As I said, right, our objective is to make great products, provide the best customer experience, and get our customer satisfied, engaged and loyal to our ecosystem. When you look at our financial performance in recent years, take the last three years, for example, the number of units sold during any quarter has not been necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business. If you look at our revenue, given the last three years, if you look at our net income during the last three years, if you look at our stock price here in the last three years, there's no correlation to the units sold in any given period. As you know very well, in addition, our product ranges for all the major product categories have become wider over time and therefore, a unit of sale is less relevant for us at this point compared to the past, because we got this much wider sales price dispersion, so unit of sale per se becomes less relevant. As I know you're aware, by the way, our top competitors in smartphones, in tablets, in computers, do not provide quarterly unit sales information either. But of course we understand that this is something of interest and when we believe that providing qualitative commentary on unit sales offers additional relevant information to investors, we will do so.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Looking at one additional point there just for clarity is, Shannon, our intention is to continue to give revenue guidance at the company level and gross margin guidance in the other categories that we've been providing and so that our guidance isn't changing. It's the actual report that changes.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.\nMike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thanks very much and good afternoon. With the staggered iPhone launch, were you able to discern any impact on the XS and XS Max from buyers potentially waiting for the XR, and what if anything can we take away from the December quarter guidance related to what you're seeing for early demand of the XR? And then I have a follow-up, thanks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Mike, it's Tim. The XS and XS Max got off to a really great start and we've only been selling for a few weeks. The XR, we've only had out there for I guess five days or so at this point, and so we have very, very little data there. Usually there is some amount of wait until another product shows up and look, but in looking at the data, on the sales data for XS and XS Max, there's not obvious evidence of that in the data, as I see it.\nMike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it, and you mentioned record levels for various components of the services business. As we look forward, if growth of services is to maintain something close to the recent pace, what are the components of services that you're particularly excited about that could drive that and be the strongest drivers? And maybe an offshoot to that, it seems like the news flow around augmented reality has slowed a little bit in recent months. Is that potentially a materially contributor to services in the near future? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Mike, as we said, during the September quarter, we set new records for many, many services categories, right, from Apple Music to cloud services to the App Store to AppleCare and Apple Pay really has an exponential trajectory right now. When we look at our services business, we think about the fact that we have a very large and growing installed base. The installed base of all our major product categories is at an all-time high and has been growing over the last several quarters, so the opportunity for us to monetize our services business continues to grow over time. Of course, we're also improving the quality of the services that we provide and if you look back during the last three years, we've added new services to our portfolio. We added Apple Pay, we added Apple Music. We added this advertising business on our App Store. And clearly, we will want to continue to offer new services over time, so there are a number of vectors that allow us to continue to grow the business over time. We have stated that we want to double the size of the services business from the level that we had in fiscal 2016 by 2020. We are well on pace to achieve that, and we feel very, very confident about the future and the opportunities that we have in the services space.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Mike, in terms of your question on AR, I have a different view than you do on this one. Just a year ago, practically a year ago, we came out with ARKit 1. Six months or so after that we came out with 1.5. We then recently came out with ARKit 2. The number of things that you can do are growing significantly. The number of developers that either have done something, or even more the case, that are working on things that I've seen are growing tremendously. There's a lot of interest out there and the number of categories that I'm seeing from gaming to shopping, to I was in China a few weeks ago and saw AR in an art sense, in an art exhibit. I was in Berlin last week and saw it being used in a historical educational kind of sense. I'm seeing it sort of everywhere I go now, and so I think we are in the early days, and it'll keep getting better and better, but I'm really happy with where things are at the moment.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Next we'll go to Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Tim, given the current trade negotiations and broader geopolitical risk, do you have any plans to consider diversifying the supply chain? And if you were to do that, either on your own or sort of forced, do you think it would have significant impact on the business or profitability?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Katy, if you look at the products that we have created and are manufacturing, they're really manufactured everywhere. We have significant content from the U.S. market. We have content from Japan to Korea to many countries, and we have great content from China as well, and so there are many hands in the products. The vast majority or almost all of the R&D is in the United States, as well as a lot of the support organizations. And so, I think that that basic model where you look around the world and find the best in different areas, I don't expect that model to go out of style, so to speak. I think there's a reason why things have developed in that way and I think it's great for all countries and citizens of countries that are involved in that. And I'm still of the mindset that I feel very optimistic and positive that the discussions that are going will be fruitful. These relationships, these trade relationships are big and complex, and they clearly do need a level of focus and a level of updating and modernization. And so I'm optimistic that the countries, the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Europe and so forth, can work these things out and work for the benefit of everyone.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's helpful color. And, Luca, as a follow-up, NAND prices fell significantly during the September quarter. Why aren't we seeing that flow through to margin expansion for the overall company?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: You're referring to the guidance that we provided for Q1, I imagine.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Let me give you the puts and takes, Katy. You're correct. We are going to be getting some benefits from commodities in general and memory in particular. Memory on a sequential basis is about 30 basis points favorable for us going into the December quarter. And obviously, we're going to be benefiting from the leverage, which is typical of our seasonality in the December quarter. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, and the impact that we expect at the gross margin level from foreign exchange is a 90 basis points headwind sequentially. And of course, at this point in the cycle, we also have higher cost structures because, as I said, we've launched so many new products in the last six weeks. So those are the puts and takes, leverage and commodity savings on one side and FX and the new products on the other side.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much, a question for Tim and a question for Luca, and I'll ask them at the same time, so you can decide who wants to go first or second. But operationally, Tim, I think your company is at a disadvantage relative to others in India, giving where items are produced versus shipped versus taxed versus installed as well as ability to own stores. So can you help us address that? Is India going to potentially be a big area, as I think you got about only about 1% market share, but it sounded like things may be softer there? And then for Luca, there will probably be a lot of pushback about not giving iPhone unit data. It sounds like you're still going to give revenue data, if I heard that correctly, but some people may fear that this now means that the iPhone units are going to start going negative year over year because it's easier to talk about great things and not show the details of things that aren't so great. So thank you very much, gentlemen.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Okay, I'll start with India. We've had really great productive discussions with the Indian government, and I fully expect that at some point, they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country. We've been in discussions with them, and the discussions are going quite well. As you point out, there are import duties in some or most of the product categories that we're in. In some cases, they compound, and this is an area that we're giving lots of feedback on. We do manufacture some of the entry iPhones in India, and that project has gone well. I am a big believer in India. I am very bullish on the country and the people and our ability to do well there. The currency weakness has been part of our challenge there, as you can tell from just looking at the currency trends, but I view these as speed bumps along a very long journey, though. And the long term I think is very, very strong there. There's a huge number of people that will move into the middle class. The government has really focused on reform in a major way and made some very bold moves. And I applaud them for doing that and I can't wait for the future there.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: And, Jim, let me take the question on units. First of all, as Tim said, our approach to guidance, providing guidance doesn't change at all. We continue to provide the same metrics that we were providing before. In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we are doing, and it's new and it's in addition to the information that we provide to investors because we've heard some significant level of interest around this, is starting with the December quarter, for the first time we're going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales, and therefore gross margins for both products and services. And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our services business, which we believe is an important metric for our investors to follow. Given the rationale on why we do not believe that providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at this point, I can reassure you that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have. But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past. To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter, and that's very important because we're attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported. And so therefore, we will, as I said, we'll provide qualitative commentary when it is important and relevant. But at the end of the day, we make our decisions from a financial standpoint to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars, and that we think is the focus that is in the best interest of our investors.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Jim, let me just add a couple things to that for color. Our installed base is growing at double digit, and that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and the customer loyalty, et cetera. The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says, or he says how many units you have in there? It doesn't matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Jim.

Today we're proud to report our best June quarter revenue and earnings ever thanks to the strong performance of iPhone, services and wearables. We generated $53.3 billion in revenue, a new Q3 record. That's an increase of 17% over last year's result, making it our seventh consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and our strongest rate of growth in the past 11 quarters. Our team generated record Q3 earnings per share of $2.34, an increase of 40% over last year. We're extremely proud of these results and I'd like to share some highlights with you. First, iPhone had a very strong quarter. Revenue was up 20% year-over-year and our active installed base grew by double-digits, driven by switchers, first time smartphone buyers and our existing customers whose loyalty we greatly appreciate. iPhone X was the most popular iPhone in the quarter once again, with a customer satisfaction score of 98% according to 451 Research. Based on the latest data from IDC, iPhone grew faster than the global smartphone market, gaining share in many markets including the U.S., Greater China, Canada, Germany, Australia, Russia, Mexico and the Middle East and Africa. Second, we had a stellar quarter in services which generated all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion fueled in part by double-digit growth in our overall active installed base. We feel great about the momentum of our services business and we're on target to reach our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 services revenue by 2020. Our record services results were driven by strong performance in a number of areas and I'd like to briefly mention just some of these. Paid subscriptions from Apple and third parties have now surpassed $300 million, an increase of more than 60% in the past year alone. Revenue from subscriptions accounts for a significant and increasing percentage of our overall services business. What's more, the number of apps offering subscriptions also continue to grow. There are almost 30,000 available in the App Store today. The App Store turned 10 years old this month and we set a new June quarter revenue record. The App Store has exceeded our wildest expectations, igniting a cultural and economic phenomenon that has changed how people work, learn and play. Customers around the world are visiting the App Store more often and downloading more apps than ever before. And based on third party research estimates, the App Store generated nearly twice the revenue of Google Play so far in 2018. The app economy is thriving and thanks to the App Store, it's generating jobs for tens of millions of people around the world. Our developers have earned over $100 billion from the App Store since its launch and we couldn't be more proud of them and what they've accomplished. We're hearing lots of developer excitement around our upcoming OS releases, which I'll talk about more in a moment, and can't wait to see what they can come up with next. We've experienced rapid growth in our App Store search ad service and as we announced earlier this month, we are expanding our geographic coverage to Japan, South Korea, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We're also seeing strong growth in many of the other services as well. Just a few examples, Apple Music grew by over 50% on a year-over-year basis. AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in 18 quarters, partly due to our expanded distribution initiative. Cloud services revenue was also up over 50% year-over-year. Our communications services are experiencing record usage. We've hit all-time highs for both the number of monthly active users of Messages and the number of FaceTime calls made with growth accelerating from the March to June quarters. Siri requests have already exceeded 100 billion so far this fiscal year, and the number of articles read on Apple News more than doubled year-over-year. Apple Pay continues to expand with well over 1 billion transactions last quarter, triple the amount from just a year ago, with growth accelerating from the March quarter. To put that tremendous growth into perspective, this past quarter, we completed more total transactions than great companies like Square and more mobile transactions than PayPal. Apple Pay is now live in 24 markets worldwide with over 4,900 bank partners and we look forward to adding Germany later this year. We're excited to share that in the U.S., eBay is beginning to enable its sellers to accept Apple Pay and CVS Pharmacy and 7-Eleven will roll out Apple Pay acceptance in locations nationwide this fall. Transit is another important area of growth and Apple Pay can be used with iPhone and Apple Watch to quickly and conveniently ride public transit in 12 metropolitan areas. Apple Pay Cash, our peer-to-peer payment service, is already serving millions of customers across the U.S. less than eight months following its launch. Our third highlight of the quarter is the outstanding results in wearables which comprises Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats and was up over 60% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the March quarter. Our wearables revenue exceeded $10 billion over the last four quarters, a truly remarkable accomplishment for a set of products that has only been in the market for a few years. Apple Watch delivered record June quarter performance with growth in the mid 40% range, and we're thrilled to see so many customers enjoying AirPods. It reminds me of the early days of iPod when I started noticing white earbuds everywhere I went. A number of other notable events in the quarter, we expanded distribution of HomePod to three additional markets and we added new immersive listening features with support for HomePod stereo pairs and a new multi-room audio system. In June, we hosted an extremely successful developers' conference that previewed many major advances coming this fall to our four operating systems, iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. Developer and customer reaction has been very positive and we have over 4 million users participating in our new OS beta programs. Starting with iOS 12, Siri will take a major step forward with Siri Shortcuts, which deliver a new, much faster way to get things done and allow any app to work with Siri. We believe this will make Siri even more useful and significantly expand its adoption. We've also designed performance improvements across iOS 12 to make everyday tasks faster and more responsive. Camera launches up to 70% faster. The keyboard appears up to 50% faster and apps can launch up to twice as fast. We've always been about empowering users to get the most from our product, but not about spending all of their time using them and so we're adding tools to iOS 12 to help our customers understand and take control of the time both they and their families spend interacting with their iOS devices. Activity reports will provide information on the amount and nature of time spent on iPhones and iPads and screen time will enable parents to monitor and limit their children's activity from their own iOS devices using Family Sharing in iCloud. Developers will be able to build even more intelligent apps with just a few lines of code using the power of machine learning with Core ML 2 and Create ML. We've also included our third release of ARKit in only one year. With ARKit 2, iOS 12 will provide an even more powerful platform to make dynamic AR apps, integrating shared and persistent AR experiences, object detection and image tracking. We believe AR can enable profound experiences and Apple is uniquely positioned to provide the best AR experience because of the seamless integration of our hardware and software. The new capabilities of ARKit 2 will build on the potential of the thousands of AR apps already available in the App Store that are changing the way iPhone and iPad users see and experience the world. Turning to Mac, we want to empower our developers to bring their innovative apps from the iOS ecosystem to the Mac with minimal effort. Though iOS and macOS are different, they've shared common foundations from the very beginning, so we've taken key frameworks from iOS and adapted them to specific Mac behaviors like using a mouse or track pad, resizing windows, copy and paste and drag and drop. We've started with some of our own apps, so this fall, News, Stocks, Voice Memos and Home will be available on the Mac for the first time with macOS Mojave and we'll be bringing these great new tools to our developers next year. We believe this will dramatically broaden the ecosystem to benefit all Mac users, creating even more great reasons to choose Mac. Also this fall, the Mac App Store is getting a full redesign with rich editorial content to help customers discover great Mac apps from our developers. We believe privacy is one of the most important issues of the 21st century and we're always working to make our products more private and more secure for our users. As we announced at WWDC, beginning this fall, Safari will prevent share buttons and comment widgets on webpages from tracking users without their permission. Safari already protects personal data as users browse the web so they won't be re-targeted by ads. For Apple Watch, users will see a significant expansion of features and functionality in watchOS 5. Apple Watch will become an even stronger companion for fitness, communication and quick access to information with features including new workouts, activity sharing competitions, auto workout detection, advanced running features, walkie-talkie, podcast and third party apps on the Siri watch face. For Apple TV, we've seen major growth in sales since the introduction of Apple TV 4K last fall as video providers around the world choose Apple TV 4K to deliver their subscription services. Later this year, Charter Communications will begin offering Apple TV 4K to its customers in nearly 50 million U.S. households, providing access to live channels and tens of thousands of on-demand programs via the Spectrum TV app on Apple TV 4K, iPhone and iPad. And tvOS will take the cinematic experience of Apple TV 4K to the next level this fall with support for Dolby Atmos audio and new features to easily find popular shows and movies. Apple TV 4K already offers customers the largest collection of 4K HDR movies and this fall, iTunes will be the home to the largest collection of Dolby Atmos-supported movies anywhere. I'm proud that our team's hard work has an impact even beyond these innovative industry-leading products and services. We're always working to leave the world better than we found it and as part of our commitment to address climate change and increase the use of renewable energy in our supply chain, we recently announced a first of its kind investment fund in China. Initially, 10 suppliers will join us in investing nearly $300 million over the next four years into the China Clean Energy Fund. The fund will invest in and develop clean energy projects totaling more than 1 gigawatt of renewable energy in China, the equivalent of powering nearly 1 million homes. We're seeing great momentum in our Everyone Can Code and Everyone Can Create initiatives. More than 5,000 schools and community colleges are now teaching Everyone Can Code and more than 350 schools have committed to incorporating Everyone Can Create into their curricula for the upcoming school year. Coding skills are opening doors for students and job seekers around the world as tremendous growth in the app economy creates opportunity everywhere we look. We're also teaming up with leading educators for blind and deaf communities across the United States who will start teaching Everyone Can Code this Fall. Looking ahead, we couldn't be more excited about the products and services in our pipeline as well as limitless applications for augmented reality and machine learning technology. We're working with key partners in the enterprise to change the way work gets done with iOS and Mac. We're welcoming communities and offering learning opportunities at our retail locations through hundreds of thousands of Today at Apple sessions each quarter. We're expanding our reach into emerging markets and seeing strong double-digit growth in revenue and we're making great progress toward our goal of significantly expanding our services business. And now, for more details on the record June quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased to report the financial results of our best June quarter ever. As we have done in every quarter this fiscal year, we set new quarterly records for both revenue and earnings per share, with revenue up 17% year-over-year and EPS up 40%. We generated $53.3 billion of revenue with year-over-year growth in all of our geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Japan and rest of Asia Pacific. We grew in each of our top 15 markets, with especially strong performance in the U.S., Hong Kong, Russia, Mexico, the Middle East and Africa, all places where revenue was up by more than 20%. Gross margin was 38.3%, flat sequentially, as cost improvements and foreign exchange offset the seasonal loss of leverage. Net income was $11.5 billion, up $2.8 billion or 32% over last year and it was also a new June quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.34, up 40% and also a new record for the June quarter and cash flow from operations was very strong at $14.5 billion. iPhone revenue grew 20% year-over-year with iPhone ASP increasing to $724 from $606 a year ago, driven by the strong performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus across the world. During the quarter, we sold 41.3 million iPhones, with double-digit unit growth in several markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 3.5 million units during the quarter. We exited the June quarter towards the lower end of our target range of 5 to 7 weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Customer satisfaction with iPhone continues to be outstanding and is the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, customer satisfaction was 96% and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, it was even higher at 98%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones, up 3 points from the last survey. Turning to services, we had our best results ever with all-time record revenue of $9.5 billion. Services revenue included a favorable $236 million one-time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits. Excluding this amount, services revenue was still an all-time record and the underlying growth rate of our services business was a terrific 28% over last year. We generated double-digit services growth in all our geographic segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services and Apple Pay all set new June quarter records. Our other product category also set a new record for the June quarter with revenue of over $3.7 billion. That's up 37% from last year with great sales momentum for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch continues to be the best selling smartwatch by a wide margin and units and revenue grew dramatically during the quarter. AirPods continue to be a runaway success and we've been selling them as fast as we can make them since their launch a year and a half ago. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We were very happy to see double digit year-over-year growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high with nearly 60% of purchases during the quarter coming from customers who are new to Mac. Our year-over-year sales performance was impacted by the different timing of the MacBook Pro launch which did not occur until early Q4 this year as opposed to June last year, with the subsequent channel fill during the June quarter. Even with a difficult launch comparison, we saw great momentum in many emerging markets, with growth well into double digits and we established new June quarter records for Mac sales in India, Turkey, Chile and Central and Eastern Europe. iPad unit sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter and we gained significant share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC. We recorded double digit iPad unit growth in both our Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific segments with a new June quarter record for iPad sales in Mainland China. Almost half of iPad purchases in the quarter were by customers new to iPad and our active installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high. Our overall performance compared to last year was impacted by the introduction of new iPad Pro models in June of last year which resulted in both a different mix with higher ASPs and channel sale a year ago. NPD indicates that iPad has 60% share of the U.S. tablet market in the June quarter, up from 51% share a year ago. And the most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 94%, and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads. We continue to make great strides with enterprise customers across multiple industries. For example, financial services institutions are increasingly using iPads to deploy digital signature solutions for customer consent, compliance requirements, new account openings and services transactions. In the railway industry, businesses around the world are using iPhone and iPad to support operations, training, passenger engagement and maintenance activities. And leading global automotive companies are deploying iPads in dealerships for sales enablement and end-to-end customer service management and are choosing iPhone as the standard mobile device for their employees around the world. More and more companies are giving their teams a choice when it comes to the devices they use at work and enterprises including Salesforce and Capital One are deploying Macs based on employee preference. In fact, at Salesforce, the majority of their 35,000 employees are using Macs and companies tell us that Mac has been instrumental in helping them attract and retain talent while providing strong security, streamlined deployment, workflow and significantly lower total cost of ownership. We're also seeing great interest in Business Chat, our powerful new way for organizations to connect with customers. Business Chat lets customers get answers to questions, resolve issues and complete transactions directly from within Messages by starting a conversation on their iPhone or iPad and even continue the conversation on their Mac or Apple Watch. DISH Network is making Business Chat available to customers across the U.S. to enhance the customer service experience for pay TV. Customers can instantly reach a live agent with their questions, make account changes, schedule an appointment, or order a pay-per-view movie or sporting event, all without leaving the Messages conversation. And Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies, is testing Business Chat with Aramark to handle beverage holders during games. Fans simply use their iPhone camera to scan a QR code on the back of their seats taking them directly to a Business Chat conversation in Messages. From there, they can order drinks, pay quickly and securely with Apple Pay and have them delivered directly to their seats without missing a moment of on-field play. Our retail and online stores had a great quarter thanks to very strong growth from iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch and the expansion of HomePod to Canada, France and Germany. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very successful Today at Apple sessions. We continue to add content across all Today at Apple topics including popular new sessions on music and photography. We opened our 50th retail store in Greater China during the quarter and we just opened a beautiful new store in Milan this month, bringing the number of stores located outside the U.S. to 46% of the total. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $243.7 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $6 billion of debt during the quarter, leaving us with $102.6 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $129.1 billion. As we explained in February, we plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. We returned almost $25 billion to investors during the quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents. We repurchased $20 billion worth of Apple shares of which $10 billion related to the completion of our previous $210 billion buyback program and $10 billion to the beginning of the new $100 billion authorization we announced three months ago for a total of 112.8 million shares repurchased through open market transactions during the quarter. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion. As you will recall, our September quarter results last year included a one-time favorable adjustment of $640 million to our services revenue. Taking that adjustment into account, our revenue guidance implies year-over-year growth of about 16% to 19%. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.95 billion and $8.05 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 15% before discrete items. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock payable on August 16, 2018 to shareholders of record as of August 13, 2018. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I'll ask both my questions up front. First, for Tim. You're on track to hit your services revenue target even earlier than planned, so how are you thinking about the next legs of services growth as you move into the next three to five years? And then for you, Luca, NAND prices are falling this year. Services mix is rising. Those should both positively influence gross margins and yet we're seeing gross margin sort of hang out here at 38%. What are the offsetting headwinds and is it possible that we could see the tailwinds start to overpower those headwinds in the next couple of quarters and see gross margins drift higher? Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, Katy, thanks for your question. This is Tim. On the services side, we're thrilled with the results. They were very broad based. We had double digit services growth in all of the geographic segments and the App Store, AppleCare, Apple Music, cloud services, Apple Pay all set new June quarter records and of course subscriptions have now passed the 300 million, as I'd mentioned before, and so we couldn't be happier with how things are going. In terms of the next leg of this, given the momentum that we're seeing across the board, we feel great about our current services, but obviously we're also thrilled about our pipeline that have some new services in it as well. And so with the combination of these, we feel great about hitting our objectives and maybe even doing a little better.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Katy, for margins, let me tell you about the puts and takes for the June quarter, then I'll talk about the guidance for Q4 and make some general observations for the future. Starting with the June quarter, typically we see a decline in gross margin going from the March quarter to the June quarter. Last year, we were down 40 bps. Two years ago we were down 140 bps. This year, we were able to keep GM flat sequentially. During the quarter, we always have some loss of leverage because of our typical seasonality. This year we were able to offset that with some cost improvements and also we had some favorability in foreign exchange on a sequential basis. Unfortunately, as you know, the U.S. dollar has already appreciated again recently, so we do not expect to see that favorability to repeat during the September quarter. So those are the puts and takes for June and we're very happy to see gross margin sequentially flat for June. For September, we're also guiding about flat sequentially at the midpoint. As you know, we typically have what we call product transition costs during the September quarter, and this year we also have about 30 bps of headwind from foreign exchange again because the dollar has appreciated recently. We expect those two factors to be offset by positive leverage, because you've seen the revenue guidance that we provided and the mix to services that you've actually mentioned during your question. So we feel pretty good about also the guidance for the fourth quarter. Looking forward, you know we don't provide guidance beyond the current quarter, but I think we have a pretty good record over the last several years to make good business decisions, balancing units, revenue and margins. As you know, foreign exchange has been a very significant headwind over the last three-plus years, but we've been able to manage that. On the memory front, it is true that prices have started to decline. It has been a significant headwind for the last 12, 18 months and still in the June quarter was a negative. We believe that we're going to start seeing some improvement from here on.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Katy.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you for that color.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Can we have the next question please? Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit about trends within your iPhone sales? ASPs were above expectations and now that you've had \u2013 and that's clearly better than some of the comments from some of your competitors. Now that you've had about nine months of experience with a high-end fully featured phone, can you talk a bit about what you think customers want, what the elasticity of demand is and how you're sort of thinking about your competitive position? And then I have a follow-up.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if you look for the cycle, by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid single digit and ASP growth of double digit. And so if you, and look at iPhone X in particular, it's the most innovative smartphone on the market. We priced it at a level that represented the value of it and we could not be happier that it has been the top selling iPhone since the launch, and so we feel terrific about iPhone X. If you look at the sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely, as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone. And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe with looking at the results. At the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter and so, when we changed some of the configurations, memory configurations in the year-ago quarter. If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top three selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was number one and has been for a couple of quarters, and iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the U.S., UK and Japan. And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market, but given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone, but iPad as well.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Great. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about China, Greater China up 19% year-over-year during the quarter, I believe? Obviously iPhone doing well, but some concern that maybe some of what's going on in the trade world might have impacted. Doesn't seem like that, so I'm just curious as to what you're seeing in China and how you're thinking about it as you look forward. Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, it's a good question. Thank you. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double digit growth in Greater China. I mentioned how iPhone X and the iPhones are selling. We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad, but if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category which the watch did extremely well, and so there are lots of good things happening there. In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure some people have questions on this. And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences. That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing, but we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth. In terms of the tariffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment period \u2013 I think there's one that's exiting today \u2013 there have been three of those and maybe I can walk through those briefly just to make sure everybody is on the same page. The first was the U.S. imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum. That was many, many different countries. That started I believe at the beginning of June. There have been two other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either been implemented or exiting the comment period in this month. I think the latest one is today. If you look at those three tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs. There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China. That one is out for public comment. Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comment period for that one ends. It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue. Maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing and so we're going through that now and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back public comment. Of course the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. And so that, and we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it. All of this said, we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out because there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together, that each country can only prosper if the other does and of course the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper for the world to do well. That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this and we are hoping that calm heads prevail.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And that'll come from Brian White with Monness, Crespi. And Brian your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrian White - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.: Yes, Tim. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the multi-year partnership with Oprah Winfrey and what that says about your original content strategy and also Apple Music. If you can give us a little more colors or an update maybe around paid subscribers or total subscribers around Apple Music and how you feel that's rolled out.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. We're very excited to work with Oprah. We think that her incomparable ability and talent to connect with audiences around the world, that there's sort of no match and we think that we can do some great original content together and so we could not be happier in working with Oprah. As you know, we hired two highly respected television executives last year and they have been here now for several months and have been working on a project that we're not really ready to share all the details of it yet, but I couldn't be more excited about what's going on there and we've got great talent in the area that we've sourced from different places and feel really good about what we will eventually offer. In terms of the sort of the key catalysts and the changes, the cord cutting in our view is only going to accelerate and probably accelerate at a much faster rate than is widely thought. We're seeing the things that we have on the periphery of this like Apple TV, units and revenue grew by very strong double digits, very, very strong double digits in Q3. As I mentioned in my opening comments, we're seeing different providers pick up the Apple TV and use it as their box to go to market with their subscription service. There are, within the 300 million-plus paid subscriptions, some of these are third party video subscriptions and we see the growth that is going on there. It's like 100% year-over-year. And so all the things from a \u2013 all the forcing functions here from the outside all point to dramatic changes speeding up in the content industry, and so we're really happy to be working on some of them, but we're just not ready to talk about it in depth today. In terms of Apple Music, we're well over 50 million listeners now when you add our paid subscribers and the folks in the trial, and so we're moving along at a very, very good rate. It appears to us or in what we've been told is that we took the leadership position in North America during the quarter and we have the leadership position in Japan, and so in some of the markets that we've been in for a long period of time. We're doing quite well, but really, the key thing in music is not the competition between companies that are providing music. It's the real challenge is to grow the market, because if you add everyone up that's providing subscription music today or streaming music, it's, outside of China, it's less than 200 million probably around the world. And so it does seem to me there's an extraordinary opportunity in that business to grow the market well and I think if we put our emphasis there, which we're doing, that will be a beneficiary of that as other people will as well. But I like where we are. Our revenues on Apple Music grew over 50% as I'd mentioned earlier during the quarter, and so some really, really strong results. Thanks for the question.\nBrian White - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein has our next question.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim please. Luca, I'm wondering as we think about modeling Q4, iPhone ASPs are typically up sequentially about 2% to 4%, sort of low single digits. Perhaps you can help us think through how we should be thinking about Q4. I know you provided some commentary last quarter on how we should be thinking about Q3 ASPs.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Toni, as you know, we do not provide guidance for either units or ASPs for any product category, but of course we provided guidance on revenue and that the guidance range implies growth of 16% to 19%. We expect the growth to come from strong growth from iPhone, from services and from wearables, which has been a bit of our pattern during the course of the year. On iPhone ASP, the only thing that I would point out is that obviously we're exiting the June quarter at a significantly higher level than in the past and so that I think is important to keep in mind as we move into the September quarter. It's important to keep in mind the type of revenue growth that we've implied in our guidance.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit about the health of the smartphone market. Apple's smartphone iPhone units have been relatively flat for four years and I think you've probably been a share gainer during the period which would suggest at least at the high end of the market, that it's perhaps flat-to-down and I'm wondering if you can comment on, A, whether you believe that and what you think might be happening with replacement cycles. And specifically, also what impact if any you've seen from wider availability and less expensive replacement batteries for iPhones.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I think the smartphone market is very healthy. I think it's actually the best market in the world to be in for someone that is in the business that we're in. It's an enormous sized market and whether it grows, from our point of view, whether it grows 1% or 2% or 5% or 6% or 10% or shrinks 1% or 2%, it's a great market because it's just huge. And so that's kind of the way that I view that. iPhone revenues are up 20% for the quarter over last year. We're really pleased with that and if you look at the sort of the cycle, which I'll define as Q1, Q2, Q3 for ease, you'll see that we've grown like mid single digits and on an average weekly sales point of view, and of course double digit on the ASP and so I think it's really healthy. In terms of replacement cycles, as I'd mentioned I think on a previous call, some replacement cycles are lengthening. I think that the major catalyst for that was probably the subsidy plans becoming a much smaller percentage of total sales around the world than they were at one time and so I think that some are lengthening. And, but I think for us, the thing that we always have to do is come out with a really great innovative product, and I think that iPhone X shows that when you deliver a great innovative product, there's enough people there that would like that and it can be a really good business, and so that's how to look at that. In terms of our installed base, which is something very important for us as it is one of the key drivers of services, our active installed base on iPhone grew double digits over last year during the quarter and so we're thrilled with that and you can see that carrying through to the services line and the growth that we had there. In terms of batteries, we have never done an analysis internally about how many people decided to get a lower-priced battery than buy another phone because it was never about that for us. It was always about doing something great for the user and I think if you treat the users and the customers well, then you have a good business over time and so that's how we'd look at that.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Toni.\nAntonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we'll take a question from Laura Martin from Needham.\nLaura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah, can you hear me okay?\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes.\nLaura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Okay. Super. So I'd like to focus on product roadmap and strategy. There is a war going on for the home, the connected home, over the Internet of Things. And with two products, the HomePod and Apple TV in the home, my question is strategically, how do you feel about the importance of being in the home and whether it threatens your dominance outside the home with your core business in the mobile devices if you sort of lose that battle? I'm just trying to figure out strategically when you think about where the puck is going, how important is it for you to have a beachhead in the home as well as out of home?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: I think the home business, Laura, is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV. They're both important products clearly, but everybody has their iPhone at home as well and everybody has their Mac at home and everyone has their iPad at home. And so in terms of the Siri access point, as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions. I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on and so forth. Part of that is on HomePod but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad, and so I think home is important. Home is important. Work is important. The movement between the two are important. Health is important. So the smartphone has become the repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just meant for a portion of it and so I think all of those are important and we're focused on all of them.\nLaura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful, actually. Okay.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thanks for your question.\nLaura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Yeah. Sort of. I mean I'll watch your product roadmap and be able to tell what the answer is. The other thing, the thing I get in fights with investors about the most is this and I'd love your insight on this. I love the expansion of the new products. The question I have is are they actually on-ramps into the Apple ecosystem, the Beats, the Watch, the AirPods, subscriptions, are they on-ramps into the ecosystem or is the on-ramp to the ecosystem the iPhone and then these new products add revenue per member once you get somebody into the ecosystem via the iPhone?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: A lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem, even though they might not currently use all the different products. And so the way that I think about those products are they're products within the ecosystem itself. And there's the AirPods have really gone through the roof and the Apple Watch has hit an air pocket and has gone to a whole different level as I'd mentioned earlier with our overall wearables revenue. And so in my view, this is a part of the \u2013 they are a core part of the ecosystem.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Laura.\nLaura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: But do they attract people to the ecosystem or does the person have to have an iPhone first?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: It is, well, but on your point though, it is clear from communications I've had with users that some of them were attracted to iPhone because of the Apple Watch.\nLaura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Oh, I see.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: So the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone. The reverse of that is also true, is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided I really want something to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth like the watch does so well and so it's not always a linear path. I see these things as being somewhat fluid and different for each user.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Laura.\nLaura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: So they're complementary and self-reinforcing? Okay. That makes sense. All right. Thanks very much.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: That's exactly right. Thank you for the question.\nLaura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Laura.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone and the numbers for the telephone replay are 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Nancy, and to everyone joining us, welcome. We're proud to announce the results of a very successful quarter today, setting new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings. We generated $61.1 billion of revenue. That's up 16% from last year, making it our sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. Our performance was broad-based, with iPhone revenue up 14%, services up 31% and wearables up almost 50%. We grew in each of our geographic segments, and in Greater China and Japan, revenue was up more than 20%. iPhone's second quarter performance capped a tremendous fiscal first half with $100 billion in iPhone revenue, an increase of $12 billion over last year, setting a new first half record and achieving our highest first half growth rate in three years. iPhone gained share during the quarter based on IDC's latest estimates for the global smartphone market. And customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, this is the first cycle in which the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. Q2 was our best quarter ever for services and momentum there continues to be incredibly strong. Revenue topped $9 billion for the first time, up more than $2 billion over last year's March quarter. We had all-time record revenue from the App Store, from Apple Music, from iCloud, from Apple Pay and more, all of which are a powerful illustration of the importance of our huge active installed base of devices and the loyalty and engagement of our customers. Across all our services, paid subscriptions surpassed 270 million, up over 100 million from a year ago and up $30 million in the last 90 days alone, contributing to the overall increase in services revenue. Apple Pay continues its strong growth with active users more than doubling and transactions tripling year-over-year. We believe the availability of Apple Pay at major transit systems have been a key driver of adoption among commuters and in March, we launched Express Transit with Apple Pay in Beijing and Shanghai, the second and third largest transit systems in the world. Apple Pay is already the most successful mobile transit payment system in Tokyo, which has the busiest transit system of all. With the launch of Brazil in April, Apple Pay is now available in 21 markets and we expect Norway, Poland and Ukraine to launch in the next several months. This was another outstanding quarter for our wearables business, which includes Apple Watch, Beats and AirPods with combined revenue of almost 50% year-over-year. Looking at its revenue over the last four quarters, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 300 company. Apple Watch had another great quarter with revenue growing by strong double digits year-over-year to a new March quarter record. Millions of customers are using Apple Watch to help them stay active, healthy and connected and they have made it the top selling watch in the world. We launched carrier support for Series 3 with cellular in Mainland China, Hong Kong and Thailand during the quarter with more markets on the way. And now with Watch OS 4.2, there are more features than ever before. For example, in addition to tracking your workouts and heart rate, skiers and snowboarders can record runs, see vertical descent and calculate speed, as well as contribute data directly to the Apple Watch activity app. AirPods are incredibly popular and we're seeing them in more and more places, in the gym, in coffee shops, wherever people are enjoying music on their Apple devices. This product is a runaway hit, and we're working hard to meet the incredible demand. We started shipping HomePod in February, and it's widely recognized as having the best audio quality for its size and class. HomePod is a breakthrough speaker that delivers amazing sound, and we believe it will change the way people listen to music at home. It's currently available in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, and we're looking forward to adding new features to HomePod and introducing it to more markets around the world soon. In March, we announced new products for the education community, including updating our most popular iPad with support for Apple Pencil. It empowers students to be even more creative and productive, from learning to code to sketching ideas and jotting down handwritten notes to marking up screenshots. And the new iPad's gorgeous retina display, advanced chip and enhanced cameras and sensors are designed to support the next generation of apps for immersive augmented reality experiences in the classroom. In addition to our successful Everyone Can Code initiative, we've launched Everyone Can Create. It's a new free curriculum that makes it fun and easy for teachers to integrate drawing, music, film making or photography into their existing lesson plans for any subject. We believe education is the great equalizer. And whether it's through our coding programs, our unrivaled augmented reality platform, or the creativity both can unleash, we're proud to help students everywhere reach new frontiers of learning with Apple technology. In March, we also released iOS 11.3, a major update offering new immersive augmented reality experiences, access to personal health records in the Health app and more. Apps can now deliver AR experiences that use vertical walls and doors in addition to tables and chairs and can make \u2013 more accurately map irregular shaped surfaces. The update to ARKit that made this possible came just six months after we launched the world's largest AR platform. Also in iOS 11.3, patients in nearly 40 health systems representing hundreds of hospitals and clinics can now consolidate their medical records from multiple sources and view them all in one place, right from their iPhone. This data is encrypted and protected with the user's iPhone passcode, and it can help them better understand their health history, have informed conversations with doctors and family members, and make future health care decisions. Consistent with our long-term focus, privacy is a key element of these initiatives for education and personal health. We're relentless about making the best products and experiences in the world, while fiercely protecting our users' privacy, because we believe privacy is a fundamental human right. Our environmental initiatives recently passed an important milestone. All of our global facilities across 43 countries are now powered with 100% clean energy. We work with communities around the world to build clean power sources. Apple now has 25 renewable energy projects operational and 15 more under construction. We're also driving our supply chain to use clean energy. As of last month, 23 of our suppliers are committed to operating on 100% renewable energy. We're now halfway through our fiscal 2018 with nearly $150 billion in revenue and double digit growth in all of our geographic segments. We generated almost $34 billion in earnings in six months, and we're very bullish on Apple's future. We have the best pipeline of products and services we've ever had. We have a huge installed base of active devices that is growing across all products, and we have the highest customer loyalty and satisfaction in the industry. Our services business is growing dramatically. Our balance sheet and our cash flow generation are strong and that allows us to invest significantly in our product roadmap and still return a very meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders. Recent corporate tax reform enables us to deploy our global cash more efficiently. In the United States, we expect our direct investment in the economy to exceed $350 billion over the next five years, including $30 billion in capital expenditures. And we expect to create over 20,000 U.S. jobs at Apple over that timeframe. We're narrowing the site selection for a new U.S. campus, and we look forward to sharing more information on that later this year. Consistent with our annual cadence, today we're providing an update on our capital return program. Tax reform makes it possible for us to execute our program more efficiently, both through share repurchases and payment of dividend to the tens of millions of investors who own Apple stock either directly or indirectly from large pension funds to individuals with retirement accounts. So today, given our strong confidence in Apple's future, we're announcing a significant update to our capital return program. Our Board of Directors has approved a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization as well as a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend, effective with our next dividend payable later this month. Luca will provide more details about our program as well as a more in-depth discussion of the quarter's results. So I'll now turn the call over to him. Luca?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We're very pleased to report record financial results for our March quarter with revenue growth of 16%, EPS up 30%. Starting with revenue, we generated $61.1 billion, our highest ever for a March quarter. Revenue grew in all of our geographic segments, setting new Q2 records in most countries we track. Performance was very strong in emerging markets where revenue was up 20% and we were especially pleased to see 21% year-over-year growth in Greater China, our strongest growth rate from that segment in 10 quarters. We also set Q2 revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in Japan. Gross margin was 38.3%, essentially flat sequentially, as we offset the seasonal loss of leverage with cost improvements and a shift in mix toward services. Operating margin was 26% of revenue. Net income was $13.8 billion, up $2.8 billion over last year and a March quarter record. Diluted earnings per share were $2.73, up 30% to a new record for Q2, and cash flow from operations was very strong at $15.1 billion. iPhone revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with iPhone ASP increasing to $728 from $655 a year ago, driven primarily by the performance of iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. During the quarter we sold 52.2 million iPhones, up 3% over last year, and we grew iPhone units by double digits in several markets including Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, Central and Eastern Europe, Mexico and Vietnam. Our performance from a customer demand standpoint was even stronger than our reported results, as we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.8 million units, 600,000 units more than the March quarter reduction last year. We exited the March quarter within our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory. Our customers are extremely happy with their iPhones. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates that across all iPhone models, the customer satisfaction rating was 95%, and combining iPhone 8, 8 Plus and iPhone X, customer satisfaction was even higher, at 99%. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 78% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to services. We had a sensational quarter with all-time record revenue of $9.2 billion, and that's up more than $2 billion from last year, an increase of 31% and double the services revenue we generated in the March quarter just four years ago. Our services business is growing at a very fast pace all around the world, with revenue up more than 25% year-over-year in each of our five geographic segments. The App Store set a new all-time revenue record in the March quarter and Apple Music reached a new record for both revenue and paid subscribers, which have now passed 40 million. iCloud storage revenue was up by over 50% year-over-year to a new all-time record, and AppleCare revenue grew at its highest rate in five quarters, setting a new March quarter record. Our other product category also set a new record for the March quarter with revenue of almost $4 billion. We began shipping HomePod in February and unit sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods reached a new high for the March quarter. When we combine all our wearables and home products, they accounted for over 90% of the total growth in the other products category. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac which set a new March quarter revenue record including new records in both the Americas and Greater China. We sold 4.1 million Macs, generating year-over-year growth in many emerging markets including Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and India. We were happy to see double digit growth in our active installed base of Macs to a new all-time high, with almost 60% of March quarter purchases coming from customers who are new to Mac. iPad grew both units and revenue for the fourth consecutive quarter. We sold 9.1 million iPads and about half of purchases were by customers new to iPad. Growth was particularly strong in Japan, in Latin America, Middle East and Africa and Central and Eastern Europe. All markets where iPad sales were up double digits compared to a year ago. We gained share of the global tablet market based on the latest estimates from IDC and our active installed base of iPads reached an all-time high. NPD indicates that iPad has 53% of the U.S. tablet market in the March quarter, up from 40% share a year ago. And the most recent customer survey from 451 Research measured iPad customer satisfaction ratings of 95% and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the June quarter, 73% plan to purchase iPads. We continue to make great strides in the enterprise market. In February, we announced a new cyber risk management solution for businesses with Cisco, Aon and Allianz. This combined approach is an industry first that integrates the most secure technology from Apple and Cisco, cyber resilience evaluation services from Aon and options for enhanced cyber insurance coverage from Allianz. Organizations will now be able to better manage and protect themselves from cyber risks associated with ransomware and other malware-related threats. We are thrilled that insurance industry leaders recognize that Apple products provide superior security. In March, we announced two new services with IBM to bring more dynamic and intelligent insights into apps. IBM Watson services for Core ML and IBM Cloud Developer Console for Apple will enable developers to more easily build native iOS apps that bring together machine learning with artificial intelligence and cloud services. In healthcare, iPhones are being used across leading health systems including Cedars-Sinai, the Mayo Clinic and HCA Healthcare with iOS apps to support clinical workflows, communications and care delivery. In fact, HCA Healthcare recently announced they plan to deploy 100,000 iPhones across their hospital sites within the next three years. We had great performance from our retail and online stores which produced their highest March quarter revenue ever. Year-over-year growth was led by iPhone as well as strong performance from AirPods and introduction of HomePod. Our stores hosted more than 250,000 of our very popular Today at Apple sessions with a particular emphasis on coding and app design. During the quarter, we opened beautiful new stores in South Korea and in Austria, our first in both countries, and three weeks ago we opened our newest store in Tokyo, bringing us to 502 stores across the world today. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $267.2 billion in cash plus marketable securities, and we had $110 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding for a net cash position of $145 billion. We returned nearly $27 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.2 billion in dividends and equivalents and spent $23.5 billion on repurchases of 137 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also retired 5.7 million shares upon the completion of our 13 ASR during the quarter. We have now completed over $275 billion of our current $300 billion capital return program, including $200 billion in share repurchases against our cumulative $210 million buyback program. We will complete the $210 billion program during the June quarter, three full quarters sooner than initially planned. The biggest priorities for our cash have not changed over the years. We want to maintain the cash we need to fund our day-to-day operations, to invest in our future, and to provide flexibility so that we can respond effectively to the strategic opportunities we encounter along the way. As we said 90 days ago, the new tax legislation enacted in December gives us increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our global cash. It allows us to invest for growth in the United States more efficiently and it also provides us the opportunity to work towards a more optimal capital structure. As we said in February, our goal is to become approximately net cash neutral over time. Given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value that we see in our stock, our board has authorized a new $100 billion share repurchase program which we will start executing during the June quarter. Considering the unprecedented size of this new authorization, we want to be particularly thoughtful and flexible in our approach to repurchasing shares. Our intention is to execute our program efficiently and at a fast pace. As in the past, we will provide regular updates on our capital return activities at the end of every quarter. We're also raising our dividend for the sixth time in less than six years. As we know, it is very important for our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.63 to $0.73 per share, an increase of 16%. This is effective with our next dividend which the board has declared today, payable on May 17, 2018, to shareholders of record as of May 14, 2018. With over $13 billion in annual dividend payments, we are proud to be among the largest dividend payers in the world and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. We will continue to review our capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, our investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We will also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix and the pace of our program. We expect to provide a new update to our capital allocation plans approximately 12 months from now. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million. And we expect our tax rate to be about 14.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. May we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Your first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about your thoughts on sort of iPhone and positioning now that we're a couple of quarters out from the launch of the iPhone X. Given the $1,000 price point, and it's clearly selling but there's been a lot of questions in the market about sustainability of that price point and how you're thinking about it as you look out sort of holistically across your lineup. So if you could talk a bit about what you're hearing from your customers and then I have a follow up. Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Sure. Shannon, it's Tim. As Luca mentioned earlier, our revenues are up 14% year-over-year on iPhone and that's a combination of single digit unit growth and ASP growth that is mainly driven by iPhone X. I think that our iPhone line shows that there's a variety of different customers in a market that is as large as a smartphone market and so we're going to continue to provide different iPhones for folks to meet their needs. On iPhone X specifically, I think it's important to maybe emphasize again one of the things I mentioned in my opening comments, that customers chose iPhone X more than any other iPhone each and every week in the March quarter, just as they did following its launch in the December quarter. Also, since we split the line with the launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus back in 2014, this is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular. And so with the customer set that Luca referenced as well, the 99%, the iPhone X is a beloved product. And so I think that it's one of those things where like a team wins the Super Bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points but it's a Super Bowl winner and that's how we feel about it. I could not be prouder of the product.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Okay. Thank you. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit about working capital, specifically inventory which went up pretty significantly quarter-over-quarter? What's driving that and how are you thinking about, I mean, it's one of the uses of cash obviously, so how are you thinking about inventory and maybe working capital in general as you're going forward?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, Shannon, you know that we've always generated significant amount of cash through working capital. We've got a negative cash conversion cycle and we plan to continue to have that. Our inventory level has gone up. It's just a temporary event. We have decided to make some purchasing decision, given current market conditions, and that should unwind over time.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: So that was essentially component purchases?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Correct.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you. Shannon.\nShannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC: Okay. Thank you very much.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Morgan Stanley, Katy Huberty.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good afternoon. The services growth acceleration is really the highlight this quarter in my mind. Can you talk about what the biggest drivers, whether it be products or regions that drove the acceleration and do you think that we can continue to see growth north of 30%? And then I have a follow-up.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Hi, Katy. It's Tim. The services grew 31%. We hit an all-time record at $9.2 billion, first time we cleared $9 billion. The great news about it is, it's not a single geo or a single service. If you look at it, each of the geos, the minimum was at 25%. So each of the geos did extremely well and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music to iCloud to Apple Pay and more. And underneath that, if you look at the subscriptions, the number of subscriptions, I think I mentioned this in my comments, paid subscriptions had moved up over 100 million on a year-over-year basis to over 270 million by the end of the quarter. And so it's very broad-based in terms of type of service and geographic region. It's sort of exactly what we would like to see. In terms of forecasting moving forward, we've obviously made assumption for our guidance that Luca provided earlier and in terms of longer term, we're on target to our 2020 goal of doubling the services revenue of 2016 as we had talked about previously.\nKathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And it doesn't look like the threat of a trade war with China slowed down that business. In fact, growth accelerated. But anything anecdotally that you see in the business in recent weeks that would suggest that that is having an impact on demand and any actions that Apple is taking as a company to preempt any risk of tariffs going forward?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win. And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and I'm actually very optimistic. I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed. And so I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently. And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that \u2013 I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: And that will come from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.\nMichael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Just following on the services question, I'd be curious what the next drivers of services revenue are. Will it be continued penetration of Music and Pay that you see as kind of the largest future categories of incremental growth? Or maybe when could augmented reality become a material part of services? And then I have a follow up.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Well, Mike, it's Tim. Again, the great thing about services is there are several services that make up the total that are growing nicely. And I think the other good news is that because our active installed base is at such a level, that last quarter we said that we had exceeded 1.3 billion. This year \u2013 we're not going to release this number every quarter, but we've obviously grown again. And it's growing at a double digit number on a year-over-year basis. And so with that kind of change in the installed base and with the services that we have now and others that we are working on, I think this is just a huge opportunity for us and feel very good about the track that we're on.\nMichael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay. And then any potential tariff issues aside, what's working for Apple in China right now? You talked about it being the strongest year-over-year growth in 10 quarters. I guess, what's driving that? Is it iPhone X specifically, or something else that's behind that improvement? Thank you.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: It's a good question. iPhone X was the most popular smartphone in all of China last quarter. And so iPhone X has done well there. In order to hit a number like 21% on the growth that you see on your data sheet there, there has to be several things working well. And the things that have huge growth rates there are the other products category, which is our wearables business in China and the services business, which you and I just spoke about. The iPhone obviously had to do extremely well to get a 21% number. And we gained share in the market for the Mac as well. And so there's actually several vectors there that are working well for us. We also \u2013 more broadly on the iPhone, the iPhone was the top three selling phones in China. And so it's iPhone X was number one, but we had several in the top.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Mike. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From RBC Capital Markets, Amit Daryanani.\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Thanks a lot. Two questions from me as well. I guess first one, just touching on the gross margin dynamics, if I look at the guidance for June on a year-over-year basis, I think sales are up double digit but gross margins are still flat at the high end, maybe down 20 basis points at the midpoint. Can you just talk about what's driving the lack of leverage on a gross margin basis on a year-over-year basis for June?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, Amit, it's Luca. We tend to look at our gross margin dynamics on a sequential basis, and essentially we're guiding to about flat on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's less relevant for our business. But in general, I would say that this year we are seeing a more difficult cost environment, particularly we're still dealing with about 70 basis points of impact from the memory pricing environment that we're working through.\nAmit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. And if I could just follow up. Tim, you've been fairly vocal I think talking about the need for better privacy protection and well-crafted regulation over time. Could you just maybe help us understand, how does Apple protect consumer data? And how does this ongoing debate around data protection translate into a positive for Apple over time?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We protect it by encrypting it, and we keep the bulk of information or a significant amount of information on the device so that the user is in control of it. We also collect much less overall than others do. Because if you look at our model, if we can convince you to buy an iPhone or an iPad, we'll make a little bit of money. You're not our product. And so that's how we look at that. In terms of benefit, we don't really view it like that. We view that privacy is a fundamental human right and that it's an extremely complex situation if you're a user to understand a lot of the user agreements and so forth. And we've always viewed that part of our role was to sort of make things as simple as possible for the user and provide them a level of privacy and security. And so that's how we look at it.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. Luca, could you talk a bit more about the capital allocation? The dividend increase of 16% was relatively low relative to what you could have done, so are you really thinking the stock price is attractive here? And you said you would execute the buyback at a fast pace. Can you give us any timeframe of that $100 billion and how much debt do you think about in terms of net cash zero?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Yes. Let's start with the dividend. We're increasing it by 16%. This is the largest increase that we've done since we've reintroduced the dividend back in August of 2012. So we think it's a very meaningful increase for all the investors that value income. Obviously, when we come down to capital allocation decisions, we obviously also keep in mind that the opportunity for us to do some M&A activities which we do in an ongoing basis. But when it comes down between dividends and buyback, our view is that for a variety of reasons we see a lot of value in the stock. We believe the stock is undervalued and so we have a bias towards the buyback. So the dividend is a very large component of capital return because we're going to be returning more than $13 billion a year to investors through dividends but we believe that given where we are with the valuation of the stock, we think that we continue to do the buyback primarily. We are not giving an end date to the program this time because the amount is very, very large and so we will try to execute it. As you've seen from our track record during the last five years, we will do it at a very fast pace but we also want to do it efficiently. We want to make sure that we buy back the stock at the right time. And so with that in mind, we have done $23.5 billion of repurchases during the March quarter. We will give you an update to our activities at the end of every quarter and then 12 months from now we will actually talk about an update to the entire program. So you will be able to keep track of our progress every 90 days.\nSteven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC: Thank you. And, Tim, could you talk a bit about your healthcare opportunity? Is it merely selling watches over time or do you think more broadly about it? Is there a services play? You're doing some things for your employees. Could that potentially broaden out? How do you think about the opportunity there?\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We think about it very broadly and you can tell that a bit by some of the things that we've had going with ResearchKit and CareKit and most recently the health records that I had referenced in my initial comments and those all came out of getting significantly engaged in the Apple Watch and sort of pulling the strings, so to speak. And we also have a heart study that is going on currently, and so I don't want to give too much away. But it's an area of great interest where we think we can make a big difference in. And so it's a major strategic thrust of ours.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We'll go to Brian White with Monness, Crespi.\nBrian J. White - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.: Yes, Tim, I think there is China numbers are actually phenomenal in the quarter and third consecutive quarter of growth. I think there's been a lot of concerns just Apple in China and maybe misinformation out there. But what do you see as the drivers for Apple in both Mainland China and Greater China over the next few years? And also if you could just give us an update on what you're seeing in India.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, good question. Let me start with India, and then I'll talk more about China. India, we set a new first-half record. So we continue to put great energy there and try to \u2013 our objective over time is to go in there with all of our different initiatives from retail and everything else. And so we're working toward those things. It's a huge market and it's clear that many people will be moving into the middle class over time, as we've seen in other countries. China, I continue to believe is a phenomenal country with lots of opportunity from a market point of view, but also lots of opportunity from a app developer point of view. We have almost 2 million application developers in China that are writing apps for iOS and the App Store, and they're doing unbelievably creative work and innovative work. So we look at China holistically, not only as a market. On the market side, we've seen iPhone X, as I had mentioned before, as being the top selling smartphone during the quarter. We gained share during the quarter. I read some notes here and there about the market itself not being good. I think on any kind of, on a 90-day clock, lots of different things can happen. But my own personal view of China is that it's a great market, and we are certainly looking far beyond 90 days and feel very bullish on the opportunity and the environment there. I would say that the market for us is more than iPhone. The Mac gained share there as well. The Watch is getting some traction there. Services is doing extremely well. And so it has several catalysts and I'm very pleased with the results that we were able to show during the quarter.\nBrian J. White - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next we'll hear from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nWamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim, can you comment on the price elasticity of demand at the high end for iPhones, if that was in line with your expectations? Do you have a preference for unit growth versus ASP growth when it comes to maximizing that gross profit dollar growth? And I have a follow-up for Luca, please.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: We price for the value that we're delivering, and iPhone X is the most innovative product on the market. And I've said a few times, we have there sort of jam-packed with technologies that really set up the smartphone for the next decade. And so that's how we priced it. We were surprised somewhat that through all of this period of time that the iPhone X winds up at the most selling, most popular for every week of the time since the launch. And so that's I think a powerful point. And it's number one in China, which is another powerful point. And so obviously at some point if those technologies move to lower price points and that there's probably more unit demand. But the way we think about it is trying to price a reasonable price for the value that we deliver and I feel that we did that.\nWamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you, Tim. And, Luca, your gross margins have been very robust despite the headwinds that you absorbed on commodities, which you quantified, and frankly, also from the FX hedges that are limiting somewhat the FX upside that a lot of other companies are seeing. So as you, one, when do you expect these to turn into tailwinds? And when they do turn into tailwinds, would you consider reinvesting some of those into pricing or should we think about you flowing those through to the bottom line?\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Well, Wamsi, I think, let me start with where we are right now. I think you're right. I think we've been able to navigate a difficult foreign exchange environment for a number of years and now, as you know, because we have this hedging program as the dollar has weakened a bit in recent months, although during the last week it's actually started to turn the other way again, we've got the hedging program that works both ways. And also on the memory front, we feel that for NAND, we're going to be turning the corner very soon. For DRAM, we also think that we are near the peak, possibly at the end of this year. And so that should provide some level of stability. As I said earlier this year, I think we are experiencing in total a more difficult cost environment and so hopefully that can turn into a positive for us. At the same time, it's very difficult for me to give you an indication of what is going to happen in the future because every product cycle is different, and as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. There are some elements that we understand quite well and we tend to manage well over the course of the cycle. For example, our cost structures that we are able to manage throughout the year. But there are also elements that are not entirely under our control like foreign exchange. And the mix of products and services that we sell to our customers also has an impact on the overall gross margin. Our primary consideration is always around maximizing gross margin dollars, and that is the approach that we take around for example pricing decisions.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: From Citi, we'll hear from Jim Suva.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. And I'll ask actually both my questions at the same time, one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, strategically when we talk to investors they often say, oh, iPhone market is saturated. There's not much room for growth. Yet when we do our analysis, we kind of still see emerging markets like India and all those still are growth. When you think about India and those markets, do you kind of believe that some of those markets could get to much higher or a more normalized market share that you have in some of the developing countries over time? And can you talk a little bit about some of those efforts you may be doing? And then, Luca, on the question for you, is about the gross margin. When we think about if component prices start to stabilize, seeing how Apple services have been so successful and accretive to margins, should we start to look for some potential margin, gross margin upside, again should components stabilize? Thank you, gentlemen.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Yeah, Jim, thanks for the question. In terms of the \u2013 let me address the smartphone market a bit and then I'll mention iPhone. In terms of the market in general, if you look at last year, which is the last data point we have on the full market, there were still 0.5 billion feature phones sold in the world. And so many of those were sold into emerging markets, not all of them, but many of them. And we still believe that over time every phone sold will be a smartphone. And so it seems to us that with that many feature phones being sold, that's a pretty big opportunity. In terms of the iPhone itself, even though we sell quite a few phones across the course of a year, our market share globally is low compared to the \u2013 our sales are low compared to the full market of smartphones. And so our task is to convince people that currently \u2013 or have another type of phone to switch, while really taking care of people that have an iPhone so that they choose \u2013 when they elect to buy another phone, that they buy another iPhone. And so we've spent quite a bit of time on that, as you might guess. I do think that India, India is the third largest smartphone market in the world. There's obviously huge opportunities there for us, and we have extremely low share in that market overall. And so we're putting a lot of energy there and working with the carriers in that market, and they're investing enormously on the LTE networks. And the infrastructure has come quite a ways since we began to put a lot of energy in there because of their leadership and so forth. And so I do think \u2013 I don't buy the view that market's saturated. I don't see that from a market point of view or \u2013 and certainly not from an iPhone point of view. I think the smartphone market is sort of like the best market for a consumer product company in the history of the world and \u2013 but that's how I feel about it. It's a terrific market, and we're very happy to be a part of it.\nLuca Maestri - Apple, Inc.: Jim, on the gross margin side, I think I'll repeat what I said earlier, but you're right. Our services business, and I've said it in the past, is accretive to company margins. And so as we are able to grow the services business, that should provide a positive, a tailwind. At the same time, within the services portfolio that we have, we have services that have different levels of profitability, so we also need to take into account the mix of services that we're going to be selling. At a macro level, because about two-thirds of our company is outside the United States, a weak dollar is a positive for our gross margins; a strong dollar, as it's been during the last four years, has been a bit of a headwind for the company. We try to make it more stable through the hedging program. And in general, when we look at our process to innovate our products, typically when we launch a new product, that product tends to have a higher cost structure than the product it replaces. And so that is something that we need to work through every time we launch a new product and we have a pretty good track record and history of taking those cost structures down over time. So we need to balance all these different elements. I think we've done a pretty remarkable job during the last several years at managing all these different variables and coming out with a level of gross margins that we think is really good for investors and certainly it is our plan to continue to manage them that way. But it's very difficult for me to give you a prediction of where gross margins are going to be six months or 12 months from now.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: Thank you, Jim.\nJim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you for the details and congratulations.\nTimothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc.: Thank you.\nNancy Paxton - Apple, Inc.: A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

And welcome to this Apple Incorporated First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Nancy Paxton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks to everyone for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO, Tim Cook and he\u2019ll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we\u2019ll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you will hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocations and future business outlook. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. And I'd like to remind that the quarter we\u2019re reporting today included 13-weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14-weeks. And I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Nancy and thanks everyone on the call, and welcome to everyone today. Before we dive into the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to talk about a significant milestone we recently crossed. Apple's active installed base reached 1.3 billion devices in January and is at an all-time high for all of our major products. 1.3 billion devices represents an astonishing 30% growth in just two years. It speaks to the strength and reliability of our products and our ecosystem, as well as the loyalty, satisfaction and engagement of our customers. It's also fueling tremendous growth in our services business, which I\u2019ll talk about a little later in the call. Turning to the December quarter. We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $88.3 billion, which is above the high-end of our guidance range, and it is up almost $10 billion or 13% over the previous all-time record we set a year ago. It's also our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth with double digit growth in each of our geographic segments around the world. What makes us even more remarkable is that the quarter we're reporting today was 13-weeks long, while the year ago quarter was 14-weeks. When we look at the average revenue per week in the December quarter this year compared to last year, our growth was a stunning 21%. Our growth was broad-based and a key driver was iPhone, which generated its highest revenue ever. iPhone X was the best-selling smartphone in the world in the December quarter according to Canalys, and it has been our top selling phone every week since it launched. iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus rounded out the top three iPhones in the quarter. In fact, revenue for our newly launched iPhones was the highest of any lineup in our history, driving total Apple revenue above our guidance range. I want to take a moment to recognize the tremendous amount of work that went into creating iPhone X. Our teams carried out an extremely complex launch from both an engineering and operations perspective, executing an outstanding product ramp that required years of research and development; one that introduced innovative features like an edge-to-edge Super Retina Display and the TrueDepth Camera, which enables Face ID. Our customers love these new features and the new gestures like simply swiping up from the bottom, which make using iPhone even more intuitive and enjoyable. Our team has put the technology of tomorrow in our customers\u2019 hands today, set a standard for the next decade of smartphones and we are very proud of their achievements. It was another very strong quarter for services with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% over last year, and we\u2019re on pace to achieve our goal of doubling our 2016 services revenue by 2020. The number of paid subscriptions across our services offerings passed 240 million by the end of the December quarter, that\u2019s an increase of 30 million in the last 90 days alone, which is the largest quarterly growth ever. We had an all-time record quarter for the App Store with our best holiday season ever. We\u2019re seeing great excitement around augmented reality with customers now enjoying over 2,000 ARKit enabled app, spanning every category in the App Store. In December, when Pok\u00e9mon GO released its new augmented reality features built with ARKit, it jumped the top of the App Store charts. Last week, on a stop in Toronto, I met developers who are hard at work on creative applications using ARKit from art appreciation to ecommerce, and I was very impressed with what I saw. Just four months after ARKit launched to the public, we\u2019ve already released ARKit 1.5 in beta to developers around the world, and the response has been tremendous. Augmented reality is going to revolutionize many of the experiences we have with mobile devices. And with ARKit, we\u2019re giving developers the most advanced tools on the market to create apps for the most advanced operating system running on the most advanced hardware. This is something only Apple can do. In addition to the App Store, several other services had a biggest quarter ever, including Apple Music, iCloud and Apple Pay, all of which saw growth in both active users and revenue. Apple Pay has reached an important milestone in the U.S. As a result of 50% year-over-year growth in merchant adoption, it\u2019s now accepted at more than half of all American retail locations, which includes more than two-thirds of the country\u2019s top 100 retailers. Now available in 20 markets, global Apple Pay purchase volume more than tripled year-over-year and we\u2019re delighted to be expanding to Brazil in the coming months. Today, you can use Apple Pay to take a subway in Guangzhou, China, see a concert at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium or buy a souvenir in Yosemite National Park. In the U.S., we launched Apple Pay Cash in December, and it\u2019s off to a terrific start. Millions of people are already using it to send and receive money with friends and family quickly, easily and securely; to split a bill, pay someone back, or send last minute gift right from the messages app. It was our best quarter ever for the Apple Watch with over 50% growth in revenue and units for the fourth quarter in a row and strong double-digit growth in every geographic segment. Sales of Apple Watch Series 3 models were also more than twice the volume of Series 2 a year ago. Apple Watch is the most popular, smart watch in the world and gained market share during the quarter based on the latest estimates from IDC. It was the third consecutive quarter of growth for iPad revenue, thanks to the strength of both iPad and iPad Pro. Based on the latest data from IDC, we gained share in nearly every market we track with strong outperformance in emerging markets. Worldwide, almost half of our iPad sales were the first-time tablet buyers or those switching to Apple, and that\u2019s true in some of our most developed markets, including Japan and France. In China, new and switching users made up over 70% of all iPad sales. For Mac, we launched the all new, iMac Pro in mid-December. It\u2019s an entirely new product line designed for our Pro users who love the all-in-one design of iMac and require workstation class performance. It's the fastest, most powerful Mac ever, delivering incredible computational power, for simulation and real time 3D rendering, immersive VR and complex photography audio and video projects. Worldwide, 60% of our Mac sales were to first time buyers and switchers and in China, that number was almost 90%. We're looking forward to getting HomePod in customers\u2019 hands beginning next week. HomePod is an innovative wireless speaker, which delivers stunning audio quality wherever its placed in the home, thanks to the advanced Apple engineered hardware and software. Together with Apple Music, HomePod gives you instant access to one of the world's largest music catalogs. And with the intelligence of Siri, it\u2019s a powerful assistant you control through natural voice interaction. We're very happy with the initial response from reviewers who've experienced HomePod ahead of its launch, and we think our customers are going to love this new product. We believe one of the key issues of the 21st century is education. And because of that, we've strengthened our commitment and investment into initiatives like everyone can code. To find the innovators of the future, we need to nurture the students of today. Our App Development with Swift curriculum, which is available free on iBooks, has been downloaded more than 1.2 million times worldwide with almost half of those coming from here in the United States. It\u2019s also being taught in dozens of community colleges across the country, putting practical skills in the hands of today\u2019s jobs seekers. I was in London two weeks ago as we announced that the program was expanding to more than 70 colleges and universities in Europe. Millions of students around the world will have the opportunity to add Swift to their coding vocabulary and gain skills that are essential for today\u2019s economy. This is an exciting time at Apple and with the best lineup of products and services we've ever had and a set of initiatives that show how business can be a force for good in the world. We could not be more excited about our future. Now, for more details on the December quarter results, I'd like to turn over the call to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional, as we set new all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Starting with revenue, we\u2019re reporting an all-time record, $88.3 billion, up nearly $10 billion or 13% over the prior record set last year. It is our fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. As you know, the December quarter a year ago spanned 14-weeks compared to 13-weeks this year, which is important to consider as we assess the underlying performance of our business this year. When we look at average revenue per week, our growth rate was even higher at 21% with growth across all product categories for the third consecutive quarter. Our results were terrific all around the world with double digit revenue growth in all our geographic segments, an all-time quarterly record in the vast majority of markets we track, including the U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada Australia and Korea, as well as Mainland China, Latin America, The Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, and India. In Greater China, we were very happy to generate double digit revenue growth for the second quarter in a row and in emerging markets outside of Greater China, we saw 25% year-over-year growth. Gross margin was 38.4% at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue. Our net income was $20.1 billion an all-time record, and up $2.2 billion over the last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.89 also an all-time record and cash flow from operations was very strong of $28.3 billion. During the quarter, we sold 77.3 million iPhones, the highest number ever for a 13-week quarter. Average weekly iPhone sales were up 6% compared to December quarter last year with growth in every region of the world despite the staggered launch of iPhone X. We established all-time iPhone revenue record in nearly every market we track with double-digit growth in all of our geographic segments. iPhone ASP increased to $796 from $695 a year ago, driven primarily by the launch of iPhone X and the success of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. We exited the December quarter towards the lower end of our target range of five to seven weeks of iPhone channel inventory with less than 1 million more iPhones in the channel compared to the December quarter a year ago, in line with our growth in average weekly unit sales. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very, very strong for both consumers and business users. The latest data from 451 Research indicates U.S. customer satisfaction ratings of 96% or higher across iPhone models. In fact, combining iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X, consumers reported an amazing 99% satisfaction rating. And among business customers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 77% planned to purchase iPhone. Our customers are also incredibly loyal with Comcast latest U.S. research, reflecting a 96% iPhone loyalty rate, the highest ever measured. Turning to services. We had a terrific quarter with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year and up 27% in terms of average revenue per week; that is an acceleration to the 24% services growth run rate that we experienced in the September quarter. The App Store set a new all-time revenue record. The Store\u2019s all-new design is off to a fantastic start with quarterly store visitors, transacting accounts and paying accounts, reaching new all-time highs. During the week beginning December 24th, a record number of customers made purchases or downloaded Apps from the App Store, spending over $890 million in that seven-day period, followed by $300 million in purchases on New Year\u2019s day alone. And according to App Annie\u2019s latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases by a very wide margin, generating nearly twice the revenue of Google Play. Across all our services offerings, paid subscriptions reached $240 million with growth of 58% over last year and they were a major contributor to the overall strong growth in services revenue. As Tim mentioned, it was our best quarter ever for Apple Watch. And when we add the results from Beats and AirPods, our total revenue from wearables was up almost 70% year-over-year. In fact, wearables were the second largest contributor to revenue growth after iPhone, which is impressive for a business that started only three years ago. In total, our other products category set a new all-time record with quarterly revenue exceeding $5 billion for the first time. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.1 million Macs during the December quarter, which translates to 2% year-over-year increase in average sales per week. Mac performance was particularly strong in emerging markets with unit sales up 13% year-over-year and with all-time records in Latin America, in India, Turkey and Central and Eastern Europe. On a worldwide basis, the active install base of Macs was up double-digits year-over-year to a new record. It was also another growth quarter for iPad. We sold 13.2 million units with average iPad sales per week up 8% over last year\u2019s December quarter. iPad sales grew strong double-digits in many emerging markets, including Latin America, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe and India, as well as developed markets, including Japan, Australia and Korea. The active install base of iPad has grown every quarter since its launch in 2010, and it reached a new all-time high in December, thanks to extremely high customer loyalty and large numbers of first-time iPad users. NPD indicates that iPad had 46% share of the U.S. tablet market in the December quarter, up from 36% share a year ago. And the most recent surveys from 451 Research found that among customers planning to purchase tablets within 90 days, 72% of consumers and 68% of business users planned to purchase iPads. Customer satisfaction is also very high with businesses reporting a 99% satisfaction rating for iPad. We are seeing great traction in enterprise as businesses across industries and around the world standardize on iOS. For example, Intesa Sanpaolo, one of Europe\u2019s leading banks, has chosen iOS as the mobile standard for its entire 70,000 employee base in Italy; choosing iOS for its security, user interface, accessibility and reliability, Intesa Sanpaolo will deploy native apps to improve employee productivity in customer support, human resources, and marketing across the company. And LensCrafters, one of the largest optical retail brands in North America, will be using over 7,000 iPad Pros to enable digital eye exams and digital optical measurements in a personalized and interactive experience. We\u2019re also rolling out a new initiative, called Apple at Work to help businesses implement employee choice programs more easily and offer Apple products company-wide. Resources from both Apple and our channel partners will enable enterprise IT and procurement teams to buy or lease Apple products more efficiently, streamline the setup of iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and deliver a seamless onboarding experience for employees. We launched the program with CDW in the U.S. last week, and we would be expanding to more channels and regions later this year. The December quarter was extremely busy for our retail and online stores, which welcomed 538 million visitors. Traffic was particularly strong during the four-weeks following the launch of iPhone X, up 46% over last year. And across the quarter, our stores conducted over 200,000 Today at Apple sessions, covering topics including photography, music, gaming, and app development, and art and design. Just last weekend, we opened our first store in Seoul, Korea and we\u2019re looking forward to opening our first store in Austria in a few weeks. These newest openings will mark the expansion of our retail store presence to 21 countries. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $285.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $16.2 billion. $269 billion of this cash, or 94% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $110 billion in term-debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a total net cash position of $163 billion at the end of the quarter. We also returned $14.5 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3.3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and spent $5.1 billion on repurchases of 30.2 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We launched a new $5 billion ASR program, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 23.6 million shares and we retired 3.8 million shares upon the completion of our 12th ASR during the quarter. We\u2019ve now completed over $248 billion of our $300 billion capital return program, including $176 billion in share repurchases against our announced $210 billion buyback program with $34 billion remaining under our current authorization. Turning to taxes. Due to the recently enacted legislation in the U.S., we estimate making a corporate income tax payment of approximately $38 billion to the U.S. government on our cumulative past foreign earnings. This amount is very similar to what we had been accruing on those earnings in our financial results through fiscal year 2017. Including the $38 billion payment, we will have paid over $110 billion of corporate income tax on our total domestic and foreign earnings during the last 10 years for a cash tax rate of about 26%. Our tax rate of 25.8% for the December quarter was close to our guidance of 25.5% as the lower U.S. statutory rate from the new legislation was effectively offset by the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call; we expect revenue to be between $60 billion and $62 billion; we expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%; we expect OpEx to be between $7.6 billion and $7.7 billion; we expect OI&E to be about $300 million; and we expect the tax rate to be about 15%. Tax reform will allow us to pursue a more optimal capital structure for our company. Our current net cash position is $163 billion. And given the increased financial and operational flexibility from the access to our foreign cash, we are targeting to become approximately net cash neutral over time. We will provide an update to our specific capital allocation plans when we report results for our second fiscal quarter, consistent with the timing of updates that we have provided in the past. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable on February 15, 2018, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2018. With that, I\u2019d like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. May we have the first question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Luca, I wanted to talk a little bit about, more about your comments on capital structure. I realize you don't want to give any specifics about what you're actually going to return in the timing. But just maybe if you can talk about how much cash you think you need to have here on the business? And then in terms of ongoing cash flow, since toe overseas cash flow no longer be encumbered, does that change your thought process, in general? And then I have a follow up. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Of course, we've been talking about the importance of tax reform over the years, because we believe it's really beneficial to the U.S. economy. What it means to us as a company of course is that, we have additional flexibility right now from the access to the foreign cash. And in the past, we've been addressing this issue by having to raise debt as the cash was overseas; the majority of the cash was overseas. And so we are now in a position where we have $285 billion of cash, we've got $122 billion of debt for a net cash of $163 billion. We have now the flexibility to deploy this capital. We will do that overtime, because the amount is very large. As I said earlier, we will be discussing capital allocation plans when we review our March quarter results. And when you look at our track record of what we\u2019ve done over the last several years, you\u2019ve seen that effectively we were returning to our investors essentially about 100% of our free cash flow. And so that is the approach that we\u2019re going to be taking. We\u2019re going to be very thoughtful and deliberate about it. Obviously, we want to make the right decisions in the best interest of our long-term shareholders.\nShannon Cross: And then, Tim, maybe could you talk a little bit more about what you\u2019re hearing from customers in terms of the iPhone demand. How you\u2019re thinking about the potential decay rate, for lack of a better term, with the high-end phones and over $1,000 phone versus balancing that with now your ability to ship phones down below $400, because you\u2019ve expanded the product line so much when you launched your phones in 2017? Thank you.\nTimCook: The revenue growth from iPhone across all the geographic segments was in the double-digits. And I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that for an average weekly sales basis, it\u2019s actually 22%. And so it was a stellar quarter for iPhone. The iPhone X was the most popular and that\u2019s particularly noteworthy given that we didn\u2019t start shipping until early November, and we\u2019re constrained for a while. The team did a great job of getting into supply demand balance there in December. But since the launch of iPhone X, it has been the most popular iPhone every week, every week sales. And that is even through today, actually through January. And so we feel fantastic about the results. The most important thing for us is that really the number, it\u2019s customer satisfaction. And customer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X. We think about the advances in technology that were a part of the iPhone X from -- we went from Touch ID to Face ID; Face ID has been incredibly well received; the wireless charging, the edge to edge super retina display; and totally new gestures, the user experience is different. And so it\u2019s great to get that kind of feedback. If you look at the the overall iPhone line to get to the essence of the question, I think. I looked -- I reviewed the top many markets, I\u2019ll talk briefly about the top four. In Urban China and the U.S., the top five smartphones last quarter were all iPhones. And in Japan and the UK, six of the top seven were iPhones. And so in a market that is as large as the smartphone market is, people want some level of choice and they\u2019re deciding which ones to buy. But we feel fantastic, particularly as it pertains to iPhone X.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Growing double-digits of such a large revenue base is impressive in itself. But if I look at March quarter guidance, it does assume a slower average weekly growth in total revenue, as well as, I think on my math, iPhone shipments when you compare it to the December quarter. So just how should we read into a modest slowdown in average weekly growth as it relates to the last question around the decay of demand around the higher priced products? Or any impact that you might be seeing from the lower-priced battery replacements or anything else in the market? And then I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: We are guiding to $62 billion. It's a strong double-digit growth, 13% to 17%. In context, it's $7 billion to $9 billion above last year. So when you put things in perspective and you add the $10 billion of growth that we had in the first quarter and the $7 billion to $9 billion that we're guiding to for the second quarter, you're talking about $17 billion to $19 billion of growth in six months. This is at the macro level. We typically don't go into this level of detail, but think it's important this quarter to give you additional color. And maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year, during the March quarter. And also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and ASP that are embedded in our guidance. Historically, because the channel fill and the holiday season, our selling volume during the December quarter is generally higher than sell-through. This year, the difference was further magnified, because we shipped iPhone X in November rather than the September quarter. We had a very successful product ramp. We were able to reach supply/demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1 and this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2. Now, for units, there is a second point to consider. We typically reduced channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2, because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1. So we anticipate doing that in Q2 this year as well. For ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider. As you know, our newest products this year have a higher ASP than they had in the past. And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically. So in summary, our guidance for iPhone; we got double digit year-over-year growth and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis. For the balance of the Company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong double-digits year-over-year and particularly very strong performance in service and in wearables like we\u2019ve seen during the December quarter. I hope this helps.\nKaty Huberty: Yes, that's great color. Just a follow-up on gross margin. Guidance for flat gross margin in March is pretty seasonal, but you do have the tailwind from currency. And so if you can just comment on how you think that flows into the model over the next couple of quarters, the weaker dollar. And what your outlook might be around component costs in the near future. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Let me walk you through the sequential first. So we\u2019re guiding about flat sequentially in spite of the loss of leverage. That is the largest element that we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality. And we expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and with mix. FX on a sequential basis is fairly muted, because as you know, we've got a hedging program that protects us from the volatility of currencies in the short term. Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, if it holds, will be a positive but it's not something that you're going to be seeing translating to gross margin tailwind quickly. And so I think we need to keep that in mind. We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory pricing environment, which we think is going to start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. But it still has a negative impact in the March quarter.\nOperator: Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray has our next question.\nMike Olson: I know you don't talk about future products, which is often presses to questions about future products and I'll give it a shot. When you think conceptually about the path for iPhone X Style devices going forward. Is there any reason the roadmap wouldn\u2019t consists of multiple devices as we\u2019ve seen with past iPhone upgrades? In other words, the 10 was unique amongst recent iPhone launches, because it's a singular device, potentially limiting the shots on go for upgrades given limited options. How do you think about that, going forward? And then I have a follow up.\nTimCook: Mike, you did a good job of answering your question. I think at the beginning, we don\u2019t really comment on future products. But I would tell you that we\u2019re thrilled with the reception of iPhone X. And as we said when we launched it, we were setting up the next decade. And that is how we look at it. And so that's the reason it's chockfull of incredible innovation. And so you can bet that we're pulling that string.\nMike Olson: And then how you're think about AR beyond iPhone? You've created the world's largest AR platform. You've got developers generating a wide variety of apps. I realized it's still early days. But do you see Apple as a provider of a larger ecosystem of AR-enabled device beyond iPhone and iPad in the coming years? Or should investors focus on the opportunity within your existing device portfolio for at least the foreseeable future? Thanks.\nTimCook: I see AR as being profound. I think, AR has the ability to amplify human performance instead of isolating humans. And so I am a huge, huge believer in AR. We put a lot of energy on AR removing very fast. We've gone from ARkit 1.0 to 1.5 in just a matter of months. I couldn't be happier with the rate and face of the developer community, how faster developing these things. And I don\u2019t want to say what we may do. But I could not be happier with how things are going right now.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi: I have a question and follow-up. You commented on how your install based over the last couple of years has grown 30%. And iPhone is clearly the largest component of that, and so iPhone install base is probably growing close to that number perhaps last, call it 20% through 25%. Yet, if we look at iPhone unit growth for fiscal \u201918 what\u2019s implied with your guidance fiscal \u201917 and fiscal \u201916, it\u2019s been relatively flat. So you have an install base that\u2019s 20% plus higher, and a unit growth that relatively flat, which would suggest that your upgrade rate is going down or your replacement cycle is elongating. And I\u2019m wondering whether you agree with that and whether investors should be worried about that. And maybe if I could just add one other wrinkle to potentially get your response on is. Given consumers\u2019 heightened awareness of their ability to replace batteries going forward as opposed to upgrades. Isn\u2019t that also something that investors should potentially be concerned about in terms of its impact on upgrade rate going forward? And then believe or not, I have a follow-up.\nTimCook: This is up to investors as to what things they would like to focus on, so I don\u2019t want to put myself in the position of that. The way that I look at this and the numbers you\u2019ve quoted have a different view of them. But generally what we see with iPhone is the reliability of iPhone is fantastic. The second or the previously owned market has expanded in units over the years. And you see in many cases, carriers and retailers having very vibrant programs around trading an iPhone in. And because iPhone has the largest residual rate on it, it acts as a buffer for the customer to buy new one and it lines up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone. And so I view all of that to be incredibly positive. It\u2019s more people on iPhones the better. I would like to point out that the ever year major product hit a high on the active install base. And so that\u2019s iPad, it\u2019s Mac and those are huge numbers as well. And so as we\u2019ve always said, there is a large part of the -- or the vast majority of the services are mapped to the install base instead of the quarterly sales. And this quarter is no different on that. On the battery, Toni, we did not consider in any way, shape, or form, what it would do to upgrade rates. We did it because we thought it was the right thing to do for our customers. And sitting here today, I don't know what effect it will have. And again, it\u2019s not -- was not in our thought process of deciding to do what we've done.\nToni Sacconaghi: And just a follow-up, maybe I could clarify two little things. One, Luca, on tax rate, you talked about 15% for Q2. Is that how we should think about the tax rate on an ongoing basis? And then just back to you on your response, Tim, I guess maybe you could just comment on whether you believe the upgrade rate has decreased over the last couple of years, because again, just mechanically install base is growing 20 and units are relatively flat over that period. Isn't that telling the install base is -- upgrade rate is going down, or am I not thinking about other considerations? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Toni, on the tax rate, I will make two comments. First of all, the new tax law in the United States is complex. And I think we, as many other companies, are really trying to absorb what this all means. And I think we're going to be receiving, over the next few months, implementation guidance. So we've taken some provisional estimates in coming up with our tax entries for the quarter, and we will have to do that as we go forward here during the year. So it may be a bit bumpy in the short-term as we understand the law in full, and it actually gets explained in full. But I would say that for the current fiscal year, the guidance that we provided for Q2 should be approximately what you should be seeing. As we get into new fiscal year, so many things change and we need to take that into account, the geographic mix of our products and so on. But I would say for the remainder of the year, it's what we\u2019re guide to.\nTim Cook: I think on the replacement cycle, Toni, the answer is, probably looks different by geography. In those geographies that had, in the early days of the smartphone market, had very traditional subsidies where you paid $199 out the door or $99 or whatever. I think it's accurate to save those type of markets. The replacement cycle is likely longer. Where that isn't the case, I am not nearly as sure on that. I would point out that that happened some time ago and so it's very difficult currently to ever get a real time handle on replacement rate, because you obviously not -- you don't know the replacement rate for the products you're currently selling, you only know that in an historical sense. So it's not something that we are overly fixate on.\nOperator: Next question comes from Laura Martin from Needham.\nLaura Martin: I love the 1.3 billion devices you gave us, updating from two years ago. And I\u2019d love the onramp as you spread out the pricing. Do you get a sense that we have more unique users in that 1.3 billion than we had unique users back there in 2016?\nTim Cook: Laura, I missed the first part of that, you broke up on the phone.\nLaura Martin: So we have 1.3 billion [technical difficulty] unique users or I mean fewer products, so we have a higher percentage of unique [users] in the 1.3 devices and more in the billion devices. Is it a [technical difficulty] are they\u2026.\nTim Cook: Laura, you're cutting in and out. But I'm going to take a swing at what I think you're asking. I think you're asking, are there more active users today than there were two years ago when we had 1 billion active devices. And the answer is absolutely, there are many, many more.\nLaura Martin: Yes, I was asking as a percent, the ownership. You see 1.4 billion devices owned per person. Do you think it's now 1.2 billion or 1.6 billion?\nTim Cook: Well, that 1.4 billion, I don't know where that came from. It did not come from Apple. And so that's one of the things that kind of flowed out there. And I want to divorce Apple from that number. We\u2019re not releasing a user number, because we think that the proper way to look at it is to look at active devices. It's also the one that is the most accurate for us to measure. And so that's our thinking behind there.\nLaura Martin: Switchers in the quarter, you often give us switchers.\nTim Cook: It is so early on this product cycle, particularly with the iPhone X only starting in November that we do not feel we have data at this point that would be very meaningful to share. And so I'll pump that question until next time around.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Steve Milunovich from UBS.\nSteve Milunovich: Tim, you said you don't want to tell investors what to do. But the first point you made was talking about the size of the install base. Later you've talked about the importance of customer satisfaction. Given that this doesn't look like a super-cycle in terms of unit growth, are you nudging us to focus on the size of the install base, the annuity opportunity here? And do you have confidence that you can monetize that install base through additional hardware and services?\nTim Cook: What I said on the investor part is that I think every investor has to look at their own situation and conclude the things that they think are important. What I think is important, I think the active devices are hugely important and that's the reason that we released the number two years ago, and the reason that we\u2019re releasing that again today. That number speaks to the strength of the product the loyalty of the customer, the strength of the ecosystem. And so we do put a lot of weight behind that. And it obviously also fuels the services business. So I have long believed that on 90 day clock on unit sales is a very surface way to view Apple. I think that the far bigger thing is to look over a longer period of time. And customer satisfaction and engagement and number of active devices are all part of that.\nSteve Milunovich: And could you address the positioning of HomePod? What category is it in, is it a music speaker, is it a home system, since people seem to be trying to position it versus Amazon and Google\u2019s offerings? And is the target market primarily Apple Music users?\nTim Cook: HomePod is an incredible product that is a unbelievable audio experience in a very small form factor with a super digital assistant in Siri that knows an enormous amount of music. But also can handle request to like home automation to close your garage door, open your door, turn the light on, turn the fireplace on, change the thermostat, all of the things that you would like to do in home automation. But takes it further, because we think do it right from the home app instead of seeing. So you can see, hey Siri, I\u2019m reading and your room will change to the things you would like happening in that particular room for when you read, maybe it\u2019s a particular light, maybe it\u2019s a type of light, maybe it\u2019s the fireplace, so on and so forth. It also, obviously, you can also do things with HomePod like use it as a speaker phone. And so if you\u2019re talking to your parents or they\u2019re talking to their grand kids, its unbelievable audio quality for speaker phone. You can also have Siri call for you, you can send messages, you can get a Uber car or a Lyft car. And so there is just a whole variety of things. And so I think the use cases on this much like our phones will be broad based. Some people will use it significantly for music and others may use it significantly for as a digital assistance; and I think the majority of people will likely use all of it and use all of the functionality of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.\nAmit Daryanani: I have two questions as well. I guess first one. Could you just touch on what you\u2019re seeing in China in terms of underlying trends, right now? I think growth was up double-digit year-over-year but essentially in line to what you saw in September. I would have thought that would have accelerated a little bit with iPhone X. Just the puts and takes in China will be great.\nTim Cook: It\u2019s a good question. Keep in mind that this year had 13 weeks, last year had 14 weeks. And so even though we were reporting a similar year-over-year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which probably is much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration. And specifically the numbers this quarter as reported are 11% increase for Greater China year-over-year but on an average weekly revenue basis, we were up 19%. Also Mainland China, we had an all-time record for revenue in Mainland China. And of course a key part of that was iPhone. And as I\u2019ve mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top five selling smartphones in urban China were all iPhones. And so we could not be more pleased with how we're doing. And if you look at the other -- we obviously grew share for iPhone in the quarter, but we also grew share in iPad and Mac during the quarter and wearables were extremely strong there in the quarter. And so everywhere I look, I feel really good about how we're doing in China.\nAmit Daryanani: Luca, maybe a question for you. When you talked about reducing Apple's net cash levels to zero effectively over time, I think that implies -- the number goes from $163 billion today to something like zero. What does over time mean for Apple? Is that one year, three years, 10 years, or how do you define over time? And does this change your thoughts around M&A at all, and is that one reason to get that number from $163 billion to zero. Does it change your M&A thought process?\nLuca Maestri: Let me answer, Amit, starting with M&A. Our thought process around M&A has always been the same, and really doesn't change. We've been acquiring companies over the years. In calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies. And the thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product roadmaps, filling gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers. So it's always with the customer experience in mind that we make acquisitions. We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so. We have plenty of financial flexibility, of course. We had that even prior to tax reform. And as I said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report at the March quarter and that will include talking about timeframes and pace and so on. And so we\u2019ll try to be to be very thoughtful. As we said, $163 billion is a large amount and there are even practical considerations around it. So we'll see.\nTim Cook: And just for clarity, let me add one thing. What Luca is saying is not cash equals zero. He's saying there's an equal amount cash and debt, and that they balance to zero. Just for clarity.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us, especially those of you listening in on our new noise-cancelling AirPods Pro which are available beginning today. This was Apple's highest revenue in a September quarter ever, and I want to take you through some of the highlights before we get into greater detail on the conclusion of a remarkable fiscal 2019 for Apple. We achieved revenue of $64 billion in the quarter at the high end of our expectations, even in spite of a predicted foreign exchange drag of almost $1 billion. Geographically, we set new Q4 revenue records in the Americas and rest of Asia-Pacific and saw further improvement in our revenue trends in Greater China. In iPhone, where customers have only begun to get their hands on the strongly popular and unmatched iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models, our year-over-year performance continue to improve, more on that in a moment. Outside of iPhone, our September quarter revenue was up 17%. We reached a new all-time high for services with growth accelerating to 18%. We generated well over 50% revenue growth from Wearables, and I am thrilled to say that we set Q4 records for Wearables in each and every market we track. We\u2019ve got a lot to cover, so let's dive right into the details. iPhone revenue in the September quarter was $33 billion. This 9% decline over last year is a significant improvement over the 15% decline we saw across the first three quarters. The significant upswing in demand in the final part of the quarter is mirrored in the overwhelmingly positive reviews, customer feedback and in-store response we've seen for this new generation of devices, not to mention a wave of the best photos you've seen from a smartphone. iPhone 11 features the Apple-designed A13 Bionic the fastest most powerful chip ever in a smartphone plus an all new dual camera system and even longer all day battery life all wrapped in six great new colors. Since its launch, the iPhone 11 has quickly become our best-selling iPhone. iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max deliver even more advanced performance for users who want the very best out of their smartphone. The new Super Retina XDR display is the brightest ever in an iPhone, and the new triple camera system provides a pro level photography experience with an ultra-wide, wide and telephoto camera. All three of our new iPhones feature night mode delivering huge improvements to photo capture in low light environments either indoors or outdoors. They also produce the highest quality video in a smartphone supporting 4K video with extended dynamic range for more highlight detail and cinematic video stabilization. iOS 13 is driving user experience forward across the iPhone family with a bold new look in dark mode, major updates to the apps our customers use every day, such as photos and maps, new ways to help protect their privacy with sign-in with Apple and performance improvements across the entire system. For Services, revenue was $12.5 billion, that's up 18% over last year and it beats the previous record set in the June quarter by more than $1 billion. This isn't a local phenomenon. We saw double-digit services revenue growth and all-time records in all five of our geographic segments, and it wasn't a narrow success either. We established new all-time highs for multiple services categories including the App Store, AppleCare, Music, cloud services and our App Store search ad business. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year '16 Services revenue during 2020. I want to touch on a number of services in brief. We had all-time record revenues from payment services. For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with over 3 billion transactions in the September quarter exceeding PayPal's number of transactions and growing four times as fast. Apple Pay is now live in 49 markets around the world with over 6,000 issuers on the platform. We believe that Apple Pay offers the best possible mobile payment experience and the safest, most secure solution on the market. We're glad that 1000s of banks around the world participate. Apple Card launched in the US in August, and we've been thrilled by the positive reception we've seen. Users can apply for Apple Card through the wallet app on iPhone in minutes and start using it right away in stores, in apps and on websites. They've told us they love Apple Card's simplicity, privacy, security and transparency, which has helped them make healthier financial choices. Apple Card has absolutely no fees and major apps and retailers like Uber, Uber Eats, Walgreens, Duane Reade, and T-Mobile have already joined to offer 3% daily cash back on Apple Card transactions. And I am very pleased to announce today that later this year, we are adding another great feature to Apple Card. Customers will be able to purchase their new iPhone and pay for it over it over 24 months with zero interest. And they will continue to enjoy all the benefits of Apple Card, including 3% cash back on the total cost of their iPhone with absolutely no fees and the ability to simply manage their payments right in the Apple Wallet app on iPhone. We think these features appeal broadly to all iPhone customers, and we believe this has been the most successful launch of a credit card in United States ever. Last month, we launched Apple Arcade, our groundbreaking game subscription service offering an all new way for the whole family to enjoy games online or offline. Apple Arcade's subscribers get unlimited access to a curated selection of games from many of the most innovative developers in the world with almost 100 new titles playable across iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac and Apple TV today and more are being added all the time. Customer feedback to date has been overwhelmingly positive, and we're very excited for the future of the service. We're also thrilled to be working with Oprah Winfrey to bring Oprah's Book Club to Apple Books connecting a community of readers worldwide to important stories by today's most thought-provoking authors. Together, we envision a vibrant global book club that has the power to bring the world together through reading. We've also expanded the reach of Apple News+ beyond the United States and Canada to readers in Australia and the United Kingdom, bringing together popular publications, such as the Times of London, the Australian and Hello Magazine, in addition to major publications like The Wall Street Journal, The LA Times, The New Yorker, People, GQ and much more. And rounding at our newest services just two days from now, we're launching the hotly anticipated Apple TV+ in over 100 countries and regions. It's the first all original video subscription service, which shows from the best, most ambitious and most creative minds in the industry. One of the great parts of this jobs is that I've gotten to binge-watch almost all of them, and while I won't spoil anything, there is so much to look forward to here for lovers of great storytelling. We premiered shows like See and The Morning Show in LA and New York over the past couple of weeks, and the stage is set for a truly exciting debut. And we're pleased that customers who have purchased qualifying Apple devices starting September 10 can opt into 12 free months of Apple TV+. Turning to Wearables, we had amazing results, thanks to the phenomenal popularity of Apple Watch, AirPods and Beats products. As I said at the outset, we set Q4 revenue records for Wearables in every single market that we track around the world. In September, we launched Apple Watch Series 5 with the Always-On Retina display, that means you never have to pause a workout or task to raise or tap the display. New location features help users better navigate their day while international emergency calling allows them to call emergency services directly from Apple Watch in over 150 countries even without an iPhone nearby. And combined with the power of watchOS 6, users are empowered to take charge of their health and fitness with new features like Cycle Tracking, the Noise app, Activity Trends. The ECG app now available in 32 markets including India has become a widely celebrated illustration of Apple's commitment to your health giving users the ability to document and monitor the functioning of their heart and provide critical data to their doctors. We're deepening Apple's commitment to medical research. We announced a new Research app paired with three unprecedented medical studies spanning Hearing, Heart and Movement and Women's Health. We are collaborating with leading health institutions to reach more participants than has ever been possible enabling them to contribute to potential medical discoveries and help create the next generation of innovative health products. Leveraging the devices customers use every day and world-class security and privacy, we hope to democratize medical research and bring everyone to the table to make the next big breakthroughs possible. Turning to iPad, we generated 17% growth driven by iPad Pro in the ongoing momentum of our wider line-up. In September, we introduced the seventh-generation iPad bringing more screen area and support for the full-sized Smart Keyboard to our most popular, most affordable iPad. For the first time, we also released iPadOS built on the same foundation as iOS but with powerful apps designed for iPads large multi-touch display, letting users multitask with intuitive gestures and drag and drop of file with the fingertip. For Mac, we generated $7 billion in revenue. We had a tough comparison to last year's fourth quarter when we updated both models of MacBook Pro, but for fiscal 2019 overall, we generated the highest annual revenue ever from our Mac business. In July, we updated our Mac portables with great pricing for students and MacBook Air in particular has been a hit in the back-to-school season. Earlier this month, we released macOS Catalina with all new entertainment apps, the innovative sidecar feature that uses iPad to expand the Mac workspace and new accessibility tools that enable users to control their Mac entirely with their voice. Catalina also brings the Apple Arcade experience to the Mac and we have already seen some amazing third-party developers bring their iPad apps to the Mac App Store with Mac Catalyst including Twitter, Post-it and more. And for our pro customers who push the limits of what Mac can do, we're very excited about the upcoming launch of our newly redesigned Mac Pro this fall, which we are proud to be manufacturing in Austin, Texas. Pulling back the lens from a single quarter, we are incredibly proud of our accomplishments over the course of a remarkable fiscal 2019, a year where we crossed $100 billion in revenue in the United States for the first time. We introduce new services from Apple Card to Apple TV+ and generated over $46 billion in total services revenue, setting new yearly services records in all five of our geographic segments and driving our Services business to the size of a Fortune 70 company. We delivered incredible new hardware in all our device categories. Our Wearables business showed explosive growth and generated more annual revenue than two-thirds of the companies in the Fortune 500. And we set a yearly revenue record for Mac. All told, outside of iPhone, our revenue grew by $17 billion to almost a $118 billion. Our overall success was achieved widely across our markets with annual revenue records in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. And as we head into the holiday season, we have an enormous amount to look forward to. We believe that we lead in innovation because we lead with our values. At the time of urgency and action on climate change, we continue to drive breakthroughs in clean power sustainable materials and device recycling. By running a 100% of our global operations on renewable energy and challenging our entire network of suppliers do the same, we are driving a virtuous cycle of demand for clean sources of power. And we see the award Apple recently received from the United Nation's Global Climate Action program as a mandate to deepen this vital work. We continue to invent and improve on cutting edge renewable materials, including the 100% recycled aluminum alloy found in many of our products, and we've added rare earth elements to our list of recycled materials with the introduction of iPhone 11. We're disassembling, recycling or refurbishing millions of devices every year with the help of Daisy, our recycling robot, and we're pushing the entire global supply chain toward recycled or renewable materials. We're driving access to critical coding skills development to educators and students through programs such as our teaching coding academies and our free everyone can code curriculum. We continue to put user privacy at the center of everything that we do and we know that Apple is strongest when our commitment to diversity and inclusion brings all voices to the table. I'd like to thank our customers, our developers, our business partners and our employees for making fiscal 2019 such a success, and I look forward to another great year in 2020. Now for more details on our September quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $64 billion, up 2% from a year ago to a new September quarter record as we had predicted foreign exchange negatively impacted our revenue by close to $1 billion, and in constant currency, our growth was 3%. Products revenue was $51.5 billion, down 1% from last year, mainly due to iPhone, but largely offset by very strong performance from Wearables and iPad. Services revenue grew 18% to $12.5 billion, up over $1.9 billion year-over-year and almost $1.1 billion sequentially to a new all-time record with broad-based growth around the world and across our portfolio. On a geographic basis, we set new fourth quarter revenue records in our Americas and rest of Asia-Pacific segments. We also saw continuous improvement in Greater China where year-over-year revenue comparisons became more favorable each quarter of fiscal 2019 from a 27% decline in the first quarter to a 2% decline in the fourth quarter. At a country level, we established new Q4 records in many major developed and emerging markets including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Korea, Singapore, Brazil, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Company gross margin was 38%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue. Products gross margin was 31.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially due to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.1% even with the June quarter. Net income was $13.7 billion. Diluted EPS was a Q4 record at $3.03 and up 4% year-over-year, and operating cash flow of $19.9 billion was also a Q4 record, up almost $400 million from the previous record we set last year. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $33.4 billion a year-over-year decline of 9%. This was a meaningful improvement to the 12% decline in the third quarter and a 16% decline in the first half of the fiscal year. And we saw great customer response to the launch of iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro max at the end of the quarter. Our active installed base of iPhone continues to grow to a new all-time high in each of our geographic segments. And in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the December quarter 83% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to Services, we had a very strong quarter with all-time record performance and growth accelerating from the June quarter. All five geographic segments set new all-time Services revenue records and all grew double-digits. We also established new all-time records for the App Store, Apple Care, Music, Cloud Services, Payment Services and our App Store search ad business. In total, services accounted for 20% of our revenue mix and 33% of our gross margin mix. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with double-digit growth in paid accounts in all our geographic segments. We now have 450 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform compared to over 330 million just a year ago, and we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020. Absolute revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year. There are now more than 35,000 subscription apps on our platform, with the largest accounting for less than 0.25% of total services revenue. Among our many all-time services records, it was the best quarter ever for AppleCare. Thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution. And to better meet our customers' needs, we announced a new iPhone repair program making it easier for independent providers across the U.S. to tap into the same resources as our Apple Authorized Service Provider network and offering customers additional options for the most common out-of-warranty iPhone repairs. The new program complements our continued investment in our growing global network of over 5,000 Apple Authorized Service Providers the lead the industry for customer satisfaction and help millions of people with both in and out-of-warranty service for all Apple products. Next, I would like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $7 billion, down 5% from last year due to a different mix of products, given the strength of our MacBook Air line-up and a difficult comparison to last year's launch of MacBook Pro models. Despite the tough compare, we generated an all-time revenue record for Mac in the US and in India and a fourth quarter revenue record in Japan. More than half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all-time high. We had great results for iPad with revenue of $4.7 billion, up 17% from a year ago. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments with a Q4 revenue record in Japan. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the September quarter were new to iPad, and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 95% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 97% from businesses. And among both consumers and businesses who plan to purchase tablets in the December quarter more than 80% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new fourth quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 54% year-over-year with growth accelerating from the third quarter across all five geographic segments. The performance was driven by tremendous growth across Apple Watch, AirPods, BIS products and accessories. And as Tim mentioned, we set Q4 records for our Wearables category in every single market we track around the world. Our retail and online stores produced fantastic results, generating record September quarter revenue in all five geographic segments, and strong double-digit growth across iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and accessories. We also continue to see great results from our trade-in program with more than five times the iPhone trade-in volume we had a year ago. Last month, we reopened the standing Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York with an even more welcoming layout beneath the landmark glass cube providing nearly twice the space of the original store. This iconic store is opened seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and provides an even better environment for customers to experience our latest products, meet with our geniuses, created pros and specialists, and attend our free daily Today at Apple sessions. We also opened our newest and largest store in Japan, and fifth store in Tokyo, in the Marunouchi business district across from the historic Tokyo Station, and we opened a beautiful new store in the heart of Mexico City's vibrant Polanco district to welcome visitors to experience the best of Apple in Mexico. We are seeing strong demand for our products in the enterprise market, with growth significantly ahead of our business overall, and we have great momentum transforming major industries. One example is retail. 80 of the 100 largest retailers in the world are choosing Apple to modernize their customers and employee experiences across all functions of their business. Retailers are using iPhone, iPad and Mac to optimize their back of house operations, modernize point of sale, and deliver differentiated customer and employee experiences. Customer engagement and assisted selling have been areas of particular focus and we're seeing great results for iconic brands such as Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Sephora USA, Gap Inc., and many others. We\u2019re also having been government agencies around the world, use technologies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the way they deliver critical services to the public. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau is making fundamental changes to the design and implementation of next year's census with a goal of producing quality results, while reducing costs by leveraging the mobility user experience and privacy of iOS. Hundreds of thousands of Apple devices will be deployed this fiscal year to support an innovative new model for the collection and management of Census data and we are proud that our products will play an important role in driving quality to this critical initiative while safeguarding the privacy and security of this data. CDW Apple's partner in this initiative will also utilize Apple Financial Services, our enterprise financing platform to help minimize the cost to the public by taking advantage of the uniquely strong residual value of Apple devices. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $260 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $7 billion of new term debt, retired $3 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $4 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $98 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the September quarter, including almost $18 billion through open market repurchases of 86 million Apple shares and $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. We also retired an additional 7 million shares in the final settlement of our 14th ASR. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the type of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $85.5 billion and $89.5 billion. This range includes a negative impact from foreign exchange of over $1 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on November 14, 2019 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2019. Before we open the call to questions, I also have a special announcement to make today. Nancy Paxton, our Head of Investor Relations for the last 23 years has decided to retire at the end of December after a wonderful 33 year career at Apple and 93 earnings calls. Nancy has been the face of Apple with analysts and investors over a period of incredible growth and success. Her passion for our company, her commitment and dedication to serve our entire investor base and her sense of humor will be missed greatly. Personally, I'm very grateful for the advice and support you have given me during this last six years. We all wish you the very best for the next and exciting phase of your life. With that, let us open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you very much for the kind remarks, Luca. It's obviously been a great privilege for me to engage with so many investors and analysts on behalf of Apple over the last couple of decades, and of course it's been an extreme pleasure to work alongside with some of the brilliant people here at Apple on a day to day basis. But let's get to the business at hand for the 93rd time, and open the call to questions. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please.\nOperator:\nOperator: Certainly, today that will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations on the quarter. iPhone revenue trajectory did improve, but it's still declined 9%. So can you talk about the drivers that will allow you to get that category back to growth? And if you think that's something that's realistic to expect in fiscal '20?\nTim Cook: Katy, it's Tim. We are very thrilled with what we're seeing in early going on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max. It's early but the trends look very good. So I don't want to make a long-range forecast here. We've put our current thinking in the guidance and you can tell from the guidance we are bullish.\nKaty Huberty: Great. And Luca on margins guidance is consistent with September, but there is a lot going on under the covers; tariffs could expand in mid-December; there is some impact from the TV+ bundle; you have some big currency in commodity price move. So can you just talk about the gives and takes that land you at the December quarter gross margin guidance?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Katy, of course. As you said, I mean at the midpoint of the range, we are essentially flat sequentially. On one side, we expect -- on the positive side, we expect leverage from higher revenue. On the other side, foreign exchange for us continues to be probably the biggest headwind that we've got right now is going to be negative 70 basis points on a sequential basis. Also keep in mind that during the holiday season, we have a higher mix of products revenue than we have in other quarters, and that obviously is dilutive to the company -- to the company margin. On a year-over-year basis, we are also about flat. And on one side, we've got better commodity pricing, the environment is better than it was a year ago, but foreign exchange is a negative impact of 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question will be from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.\nMike Olson: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. So Wearables category has been strong, and it's hard to believe it's now essentially the same size as Mac. But related to Apple's initiatives in healthcare, do you think health-related features are a primary driver of Wearables growth and maybe conversely how important is a rising installed base of Wearables and the data that's associated with that to the ongoing innovation within Apple health? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Michael, it's Tim. The Wearables have done extremely well. It was acceleration further from the previous quarter. So we're thrilled with the results as to what's driving it it's the totality that's driving it. For some people it's about fitness; for some people, it's about health; for some other people, it's about communication; and for some people, it's all of the above. And I think the new feature of Always-On on Series 5 is a game changer for many of our users. And in terms of other health-related things that we have going, we will be continuing to build out our health records connection into the health app, really democratizes the information about people's health, and so they can easily go from doctor to doctor. We've got the research going that I had mentioned earlier, there will be more of those through time, and obviously we've got things that we're not going to talk about just yet that we're working on. But as I've said before, my view is there will be a day in the future that we look back, and Apple's greatest contribution will be to people's health.\nMike Olson: Okay. Thanks. And then with the strong slate of content in Apple TV+, can you just talk about the strategy behind giving it away to those that are buying in applicable device versus charging for it? And my congrats to Nancy. And thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, it's a gift to our users, and from a business point of view, we'd like to -- we're really proud of the content. We'd like as many people as possible to view it. And so this allows us to focus on maximizing subscribers, particularly in the early going. And so we are - we feel great about doing that. I think it's a bold move. And the price also for those people that are not buying a device in the period of time that we offer this, the price is very aggressive as well. You think - think about the quality of content that you get for 499, and it's amazing. It is amazing.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will come from Evercore\u2019s Amit Daryanani.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks a lot guys. I guess two questions from me as well. First one, Tim, if you think about the Services business, less than $2 billion away from the targets you had laid out a few years back. But I am wondering if you think about the growth rates you've had in the business over the last several years, the high-teens average, I think, how much of that do you think was driven by the installed base growing versus incremental monetization of the installed base. And do you see that ratio essentially flipping or changing as you go forward?\nTim Cook: I think, we have opportunities, Amit, in both the growth of the installed base as Luca mentioned in his comments, we continue to grow across every category, hit new highs in the last quarter and we hit new highs in all of our top 20 markets. And so the installed base is clearly a piece of it getting the trade-in program going, and the secondary market moving has been helpful in that as well. And, of course, ultimately the thing that builds the installed base is to make customers happy, and that's our -- always our top objective is to have satisfied customers. The other thing that is obviously happening is in many areas, the ARPU is increasing. And so, as there is more offers out there, I mean the one that is today getting the attention is on the streaming side. But if you look at the number of services that have been added over the years, it's significant and people love them. And so it's really both of those. And obviously in - finally in getting more people that are enjoying things for free to - let to pay for some of the premium services. So it's sort of all three of those.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And if I was just kind of go back to the variables discussion, especially as I think about Apple Watch and AirPods, is there a central way to think about what's the attach rate today to iOS devices for Apple Watch and AirPod update. I just want to understand if I think about 900 million plus iPhone installed base, what kind of penetration do you have at Wearables and how long could this one maybe as you go forward?\nTim Cook: We\u2019re not releasing the precise numbers of our Wearables, but it is a really nice try and get me to say that. The -- what we're seeing in terms of new adds on the Watch, I think Luca may have mentioned this in his comments is about three-quarters of the Apple Watch buyers are new to Apple Watch. And so we are still insignificantly in the build mode there, and so don't think of the penetration as anywhere near sort of a mature penetration. We got lot left there, and the AirPods just keep hitting new highs. And I anticipate that will carry over to this quarter too and we are really proud to add another product out there for people wanting noise-cancelling with the AirPod Pro beginning to sell today.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. First, Nancy, just want to send you our best wishes. We will definitely miss you. I'm sure, I agree with Luca, you've been very instrumental over the years.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you.\nShannon Cross: My questions though with regard to China, and I don't know, Tim, if you can talk more about what you're seeing in China, the trends during the quarter, the reception specifically there to the iPhone, any thoughts on - you know, Hong Kong used to be a big market, there is obviously some turmoil there. So if you could provide some more in China that would be helpful? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, we had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, and so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there. As you can tell from the numbers, we've significantly improved since the beginning of the year. We've gone from minus well into the 20s to minus two last quarter. And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew one. And so there is a very slight growth there. We obviously want that to be better. But we feel good about how we're doing. I think it's a combination of things that are - that have turned things around. On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press. Secondly, the products have been extremely well received there. Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have had moved the dial. And so it's sort of the sum of all of that. I would also say, it's not all about iPhone in China, the services area grew double digit. We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter, or I should say some key gaming approvals. It's not all about quantity, but about which ones, we saw that. Also Wearables, Wearables are doing so great at a company level. They're doing even better in China. And so lots of positives there.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. And then, I'm curious, Luca, maybe you can talk a bit about how you think about operating expense growth. It continues to grow significantly faster than revenue. So I am just curious as to where you're targeting the incremental spend? And then, is there a point at which we might just see some leverage? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Well, you know, Shannon, we've gone through different cycles. In some cases, our revenue growth exceeds our OpEx growth. In other cases, like fiscal '19, it was the other way around. But our approach frankly is not changing over time. We want to invest in the business. Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space, because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience differentiate our products. We continue to run SG&A tightly. Obviously, if you look at what we had launched in the last few quarters and few years, we launched a lot of new products, and now we are launching a lot of new services. And when we do that we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services and that is what you're seeing for example in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as we\u2019re launching new services right now, and so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will come from Bernstein\u2019s Toni Sacconaghi.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I think this is for Luca, and then I have a follow-up as well. If I look at your guidance, the midpoint of your guidance for revenues on a sequential basis, it's up about 36.5%. Historically, fiscal Q4 to Q1 was up 50% or more, and even last year given that iPhone is a slower growing product, you guided for revenues to be up 45% sequentially. So given the enthusiasm about the iPhone 11 launch and the new Wearables products and the new services, I guess the question is, why is your guidance not stronger for Q1 on the top line? And is that sort of a reflection of conservatism given that there's a lot of uncertainty in the world and we certainly saw that last year? Or are there other forces at work that we should be considered?\nLuca Maestri: Toni, thanks for the question. The guidance that we are providing if you look at it at the midpoint implies an acceleration of growth from the performance that we've seen during the course of fiscal 2019. As I said earlier, foreign exchange is clearly a headwind for us right now. This is about $1.1 billion of negative foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. So that is something to keep in mind. We feel very good as Tim said about the iPhone, the way the new cycle has started, and we do expect an improvement in our year-over-year growth rate on iPhone. Wearables has very, very strong momentum. The portfolio of services also has incredible momentum. One thing to keep in mind as we look at this guidance range is the fact that we also contemplated the comparison to the launch of the iPad Pro, a year ago for iPad as well as the new MacBook Air that was launched during the December quarter last year. So for the iPad and Mac categories, you need to keep in mind that our launch timing is different on a year-over-year basis.\nToni Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you for that. And then if I could follow-up, just on the bundling of Apple TV+, I guess for you, Tim, this is really the first time we've seen a significant bundling of services offering and hardware offering. And I'm wondering if you view this as kind of a strategic advantage of Apple and whether we might see more hardware plus services offerings - bundled offerings, and ultimately do you - do you ever believe that your hardware itself might be offered as a bundled service. And maybe while we're on that either you or Luca could give us the 30 second tutorial on how we should think about the deferred revenue accounting? Approximately how much of the $60 are you going to be deferring, and what's your expectation for attach rate on that? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Let me cover the accounting issue first. Obviously, we need to make some assumptions around the take rate of our customers on the -- on Apple TV+, right. And we don't want to get into the details of that because we do those assumptions as confidential and competitively sensitive. But you need to keep in mind that we contemplate a number of factors including the fact that we have family sharing as part of the service, the fact that there are multiple device purchases, the geographic availability around the world, the availability of local content at the beginning of the service, how many people do we have with payment methods on file. So we use all these things to make assumptions around what the take rate is going to be. Obviously, those assumptions will possibly change over time as we get more information on how the customers behave. We haven't launched the service yet - we're going to serve - serving our customers tomorrow. So we'll see how it goes, but we take into account all these different factors.\nTim Cook: On the bundle question, Toni, we look at each service, and decide what's best to do for it and with TV+, we concluded that a great way to get more people to see the content would be to do this, and it would be a good gift for our users, and so that's what we're doing. You can also see that on the other services we're not doing that. And so it's not part of a broader pattern, or although I wouldn't want to rule out for the future that we might not see another opportunity at some point in time. In terms of hardware as a service or as a bundle, if you will, there are customers today that essentially view the hardware like that because they are on upgrade plans and so forth. And so to some degree that exists today, my perspective is that we will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately. And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things. That's a part of what we announced with the Apple Card earlier in the call and so we are cognizant that there are lots of users out there that want sort of a recurring payment like that and the receipt of new products on some sort of standard kind of basis and we are committed to make that easier to do than perhaps it is today.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. And Nancy, congratulations to you too, and we're going to miss you.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you.\nChris Caso: My first question is about pricing and the effect of some of the lower price points for iPhone 11 as compared to last year. And it looked like margins and revenues did well on that, and also followed some price adjustments you made in emerging markets last year, and obviously we've seen some improvement in China as well. So if you could talk about maybe what that tells us about pricing strategy in general and perhaps that you're willing to take a little more flexible approach to drive some elasticity if you think that's going to have a positive effect?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Chris, I think that the price moves we've made have been smart and well received and do show a level of elasticity, but the most important thing by far is the product. And I think we've got the best line-up we've ever had in the customer response to the product and what the product does for them is really incredible. And photos I am getting from many users around the world are just incredible that people are taking. And so I think it's product first, and then prices sort of falls out of that, and we did decide to be more aggressive. And looking at the results in the early going, I think it was the right call. In terms of emerging markets we picked sort of locally relevant prices, and in some cases where the dollar had become stronger, we took an exchange rate that would have reflected a while back, instead of the current exchange rate. And in other words, we tried to stay as close as we could to a local price point that we knew was effective for that particular market. And those in addition to the U.S. price that has gotten more of a discussion had been extremely well received.\nChris Caso: Thank you. As a follow-on, perhaps you could talk about the potential for some of the tariffs that are upcoming what -- do you have a view of what potential impact that could have going forward and how Apple is looking to address it? Will you need to adjust your own pricing if in fact the tariffs are imposed?\nTim Cook: We are paying some tariffs today as you know, some that went into effect pre-September, and some others that went into effect in September. So we are paying some that's been comprehended. But in general, my view is very positive in terms of how things are going, and that positive view is obviously factored in our guidance as well. And just the tone I think has changed significantly and I have long thought that it was in both countries, best interests to get to an agreement that may be initially doesn't solve everything but solves some things that each party may want and get to a better place than where we're at and I'm hopeful that that's where we're headed.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Chris. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: That will be from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with one of the new services Apple Arcade, and if you have any insights in terms of what you're seeing for engagement or retention of customers beyond the initial trial period also how your partnerships with developers progressing there. How does the pipeline look like than any early projections of what that business longer term might look like?\nTim Cook: We're not going to give out projections on it, but I would tell you that we were really pleased with the number of people that enter the trial period. People are just coming out of the 30-day trial period in the last few days or week or so. And so it's really too early to tell what the conversion rate will be. But I feel like we're off to a good start and the - most important of everything. The customer feedback to date has really been incredible and we're very excited for the future of the service.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. As a follow-up if I can, trying to attack the Wearables question within the angle, what are you seeing in terms of -- I believe consumer behavior in upgrading Wearables like Apple Watch AirPods and how are you thinking about your ability to accelerate some of that replacement cycle by driving innovation?\nTim Cook: I think we, because the Watch is relatively young. We haven't seen enough upgrade cycles to really establish a pattern as yet. And as I've mentioned before, 3 out of 4 customers buying an Apple Watch currently or last quarter I should say were buying an Apple Watch for the first time. And so there is still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard. I do think the upgrade market will look at larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to -- how often and so forth. On the AirPods we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro. But I would guess that one particularly in the early going will be people that have AirPods today and want to have -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise cancellation.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you. Samik. A replay of today\u2019s call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We're thrilled to report a return to growth and new June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion. We saw significant improvement in year-over-year iPhone performance compared to last quarter, very strong performances for both Mac and iPad and absolutely blowout quarter for Wearables, but we had accelerating growth of well over 50% and a new high watermark for services, where we set an all time revenue record of $11.5 billion. When you step back and consider Wearables and services together two areas where we have strategically invested in last several years, they now approach the size of a Fortune 50 company. Geographically, we are happy with our performance across the board including a return to growth in Mainland China. We accomplished these results despite strong headwinds from foreign exchange which impacted our top-line growth rate by 300 basis points compared to a year ago that's equivalent to about $1.5 billion of revenue. Importantly, in constant currency, our revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments. For iPhone, we generated $26 billion in revenue, while this is down 12% from last year's June quarter, it is a significant improvement to the 17% year-over-year decline in Q2. We are encouraged by the results we are seeing from the initiatives that we spoke about in January including strong customer response to our in-store trade-in and financing programs. In fact, iPhone our retail and online stores returned to growth on a year-over-year basis in the month of June. Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all time high and was up year-over-year in each of our top 20 markets underscoring the quality of our products and the satisfaction and loyalty of iPhone customers around the world. Revenue excluding iPhone was up 17% from last year with growth across all categories. Starting with services, we generated all time record revenue of $11.5 billion that's up 13% year-over-year and if we exclude the $236 million favorable one-time item from the June quarter last year, services growth was 15% or 18% in constant currency which is consistent with our Q2 performance. Our strong services performance was broad based, we set new all-time records for AppleCare, music, cloud services and our app store search ad business and we achieved a new third quarter revenue record for the app store. What's more, we had double-digit services revenue growth in all five of our geographic segments. We surpassed 420 million paid subscriptions to services across our platform and we remain on track to double our fiscal year '16 services revenue in 2020. In May, we launched our all new Apple TV app in over 100 countries bringing together all the ways to watch TV in a single app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV and select smart TV's. Monthly viewers in the Apple TV app in the United States are up over 40% year-over-year. We've seen our success being driven here by several factors. First, the fact that we have been able to integrate content from over 150 leading content providers all in one place. Second, the same ease-of-use and unmatched user interface that sets Apple apart in other categories sets us apart in TV as well. And third, we're benefiting from a broader secular move to over-the-top services. We're engaging with this third trend in five ways. Our Apple TV hardware, Apple TV channels where customers can choose to pay only for the channels they want. Our massive library of over 100,000 iTunes movies and TV shows, the app store where users can find their favorite streaming services and later this year, our original programming service Apple TV+. Apple Pay is now completing nearly 1 billion transactions per month more than twice the volume of a year ago. Apple Pay launched in 17 countries in the June quarter completing our coverage in the European Union and bringing us to a total of 47 markets currently. Based on June quarter performance, Apple Pay is now adding more new users than PayPal and monthly transaction volume is growing 4x as fast. In the United States, in addition to a successful integration into Portland's transit system in May, we're beginning to rollout of New York City transit and will launch in Chicago later this year. In China, Apple Pay launched the payment card for Didi the world's largest ride hailing provider. As I've said before, transit integration is a major driver of a broader digital wallet adoption, and we're going to keep up this push to help users leave their wallet at home in more and more instances. On a related note, thousands of Apple employees are using Apple Card every day in our beta test, and we plan to begin the rollout of Apple Card in August. As I mentioned at the outset, it was another sensational quarter for Wearables, with growth accelerating to well over 50%. We had great results for Apple Watch, which set a new June quarter revenue record and is reaching millions of new users. Over 75% of customers buying Apple Watch in the June quarter were buying their first Apple Watch. We continue to see phenomenal demand for AirPods. And when you tally up the last four quarters, our wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500. We had great performance from iPad, with revenue of over $5 billion, and growth driven by iPad Pro and by strong customer response to the new iPad Mini and iPad Air. This was our third consecutive quarter of growth, and with revenue up 15% year-to-date, we feel great about where we're headed with iPad. With our current lineup of iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro, we've got the perfect device for everyone from young learners to professionals. We were also very happy with double-digit revenue growth from Mac, fueled by a strong performance of MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Looking forward, there's an enormous amount to be excited about for Mac. On the heels of our Mac mini and iMac updates earlier in the fiscal year, we brought significant updates to the bulk of our notebook lineup in the last couple of months. We now have a $999 MacBook Air that is killer for college students. And for our pro users, who push the limits of what a Mac can do, we were thrilled to unveil the most powerful Mac ever, the new Mac Pro and the all new Pro Display XDR, which will be available this fall. They're designed for maximum performance, expansion and configurability and at breakthrough pricing and they're the most powerful tools Apple has ever put in the hands of pro customers. What's more, the Mac ecosystem as a whole is about to get a big boost. At our recent Worldwide Developers Conference, we announced a game-changing tool to help developers easily adapt their iOS and iPadOS apps for the Mac. I'll have a bit more to say on that in a moment. I'd like to provide some color on our performance in Greater China, where we saw significant improvement compared to the first half of fiscal 2019 and return to growth in constant currency. We experienced noticeably better year-over-year comparisons for our iPhone business there than we saw in the last two quarters and we had sequential improvement in the performance of every category. The combined effects of government stimulus, consumer response to trade-in programs, financing offers, and other sales initiatives and growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem had a positive effect. We were especially pleased with a double-digit increase in services driven by strong growth from the App Store in China. Turning to the future. Last week we announced an agreement with Intel to acquire the majority of its smartphone modem business. This is our second-largest acquisition by dollars and our largest ever in terms of staff. We're looking forward to welcoming all of them to Apple. We see this as a great opportunity to work with some of the leading talents in this field, to grow our portfolio of wireless technology patents to over 17,000, to expedite our development of our future products and to further our long-term strategy of owning and controlling the primary technologies behind the products that we make. We also had our best WWDC ever last month, packed with announcements of great new features coming this fall across our four software platforms making them more powerful, more personal and more private. For iPhone users, iOS 13 will take on a dramatic new look with Dark Mode, while delivering major updates to the apps you use every day, including photos, camera and maps. iOS 13 offers great new ways to help you manage your privacy and security, including Sign On with Apple, which uses Face ID or Touch ID to quickly sign into apps and Web sites without sharing your personal information. And improvements across the entire system will make iPhone even faster and more delightful to use than ever before. For the first time, iPad is getting its own version of iOS, called iPadOS, a strategic step forward that takes the iPad experience to a whole new level. The redesigned home screen, powerful new multitasking tools and deeper integration with Apple Pencil take productivity and creativity further, including using your iPad as an extended and interactive second monitor for your Mac. For Apple TV, tvOS 13 will make the big-screen experience even more personal. With a redesigned home screen and multi-user support, everyone in the family can get a more engaging and tailored experience with their favorite TV shows, movies, sports and news, along with Apple Music, photos and videos in iCloud, and an App Store with thousands of great games and apps. watchOS 6 is a major step forward in helping Apple Watch users stay healthy, active and connected. Apple Watch now has a dedicated App Store that users can access directly from the device and new watch faces, Siri enhancements, and music and audio features make Apple Watch more useful than ever. And of course, we continue to innovate on Apple Watch's promise to be an intelligent guardian for your health. watchOS 6 includes powerful new features like notifications that warn about high decibel noise to protect your hearing and cycle tracking to aid in women's health care decisions. In the June quarter, we expanded the availability of the ECG app and a regular rhythm notifications to five additional European countries and added Canada and Singapore just last week, making them available in 31 countries and regions around the world, with more to come later this year. We're very proud of the muscle we've built in bringing regulated products like these to market. This is an important competency that creates exciting opportunities for us moving forward. As I noted earlier, we believe macOS Catalina will be a breakthrough in the Mac ecosystem. A new tool included in macOS Catalina called Mac Catalyst gives developers a major head start in bringing their iOS apps to the Mac. Thousands of developers are already using it to bring their apps to the Mac ecosystem and we expect to see a wave of popular apps arriving for the Mac as early as this fall. Again, it's worth taking a step back and digesting the bigger picture here. These updates are the latest steps in a broader strategic effort to make the user experience across iOS, macOS, iPadOS, watchOS and tvOS more effortless and more intuitive. Apple is alone in offering this kind of value and ecosystem to its customers. And these devices and their platforms are unmatched in their ease-of-use, their seamlessness and their privacy and security. And while providing these things, we've created a dynamic environment where developers benefit greatly from creating for and distributing on these platforms. And our customers, of course, benefit greatly from access to all this creativity and innovation. We also unveiled other exciting technologies to make it easier and faster for developers to create powerful new apps. SwiftUI provides an intuitive new framework for building sophisticated user interfaces across our software platforms using simple easy-to-use code. Core ML 3 supports the acceleration of more types of advanced real-time machine learning models, and Create ML lets developers build machine learning models without writing code. We have the world's largest augmented reality enabled platform and thousands of they ARKit-enabled applications in the App Store. Building on this strategy, and our momentum in this area, we introduced three new AR-based technologies. ARKit 3 uses on device, real-time machine learning to recognize the human form and integrates people seamlessly into AR experiences. RealityKit is a new developer framework built from the ground up to provide all the tools and technologies required to make AR objects virtually lifelike. And Reality Composer brings AR content creation to tens of millions of developers who have no 3D experience. Our developers are already running with these new technologies and we think our customers are going to love some of the apps that these creators have in store in the months ahead. On so many fronts there's an enormous amount to look forward to over the next few months, including the launch of new services like Apple Arcade, Apple TV+, and Apple Card. And without giving too much away, we have several new products that we can't wait to share with you. Until then, thanks for joining us today. And for more details on the June quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. We're happy to report a June quarter revenue record of $53.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year. We return to growth in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment around the world, which impacted our year-over-year growth rate by 300 basis points. We set June quarter revenue records in the Americas, in Japan and the rest of Asia Pacific and as Tim mentioned earlier all our geographic segments grew in constant currency. Overall, products revenue was $42.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year, which is significantly better than the 8% decline in products revenue that we experienced during the first half of the fiscal year. Product categories outside of iPhone grew 20%, with strong results in Wearables, Mac and iPad. Services revenue grew 13% to a new all-time record of $11.5 billion. Excluding the one-time item, we highlighted a year ago in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits, services revenue growth was 15% and 18% in constant currency terms. On a geographic basis, we saw marked improvement in our year-over-year comparisons from emerging markets relative to the first half of this fiscal year, particularly in the BRIC countries, where year-over-year performance went from a 25% revenue decline in the first half to 3% growth in the June quarter. We set June quarter revenue records in several major developed markets, including the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Australia and Korea. In emerging markets, we returned to growth in Mainland China, grew strong double digits in India and Brazil and we set new Q3 records in Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines. Company gross margin was 37.6%, flat sequentially and in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 30.4% down about 80 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and product mix partially offset by favorable cost. Services gross margin was 64.1%, up 30 basis points sequentially, primarily due to a favorable mix. Net income was $10 billion, diluted earnings per share were $2.18 and operating cash flow was $11,600,000,000. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $26 billion, down 12% compared to a year ago. This was significantly better year-over-year performance than last quarter's 17% decline, with sequential improvement in year-over-year comparisons in 15 of our top 20 markets. Our active installed base of iPhone continued to grow to a new all time high in each of our geographic segments and in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research, indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 10R, iPhone 10S and 10S Max combined. Among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the September quarter, 83% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to services, we reached an all-time revenue record in spite of foreign exchange headwinds with double-digit growth from the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, and AppleCare, and triple digit growth from Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. All geographic segments had double-digit growth in services revenue and set new June quarter records with all-time records in the Americas and Rest of Asia Pacific. In total, services accounted for 21% of Apple revenue and 36% of gross margin dollars. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all time high in the June quarter and the number of paid accounts grew strong double digits compared to last year. We now have over 420 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platforms and we are well on our way to our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark during 2020. On the App Store, our growth accelerated sequentially. Our subscription business continues to grow strongly and is extremely diversified across many categories such as entertainment, lifestyle, photo and video and music. Third-party subscription revenue grew by over 40% and across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.25% of total services revenue. Among our many services records, it was our best quarter ever for AppleCare. We are seeing an increase in service contract attach rates and are expanding distribution of AppleCare through our partners. We also recently expanded our authorized service provider network and nearly 1000 Best Buy stores across the U.S. are now offering expert service and repairs for Apple products. This expansion provides customers with an even more convenient access to repairs using parts certified for safety, quality and reliability. In addition to Apple retail stores there are over 1800 third-party Apple authorized service providers in the U.S., which is 3x as many locations as three years ago. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.8 billion, up 11% compared to last year. Mac revenue grew in 4 of our 5 geographic segments and set June quarter records in the U.S., Europe and Japan, as our overall market performance significantly outpaced the global PC industry. Nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac, with revenue growing in both developed and emerging markets and the active installed base of Macs again reached a new all time high. We also had great results for iPad, with $5 billion in revenue, up 8%. iPad revenue grew in all 5 of our geographic segments, with a Q3 revenue record in Mainland China and double-digit growth in emerging markets. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the June quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all time high. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the September quarter, 75% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables, home and accessories revenue accelerated across all our geographic segments, growing 48% to over $5.5 billion and setting a June quarter record. This growth was fueled primarily by the strong performance of our wearables business, which was up well over 50% and has become the size of a Fortune 200 company over the last 12 months. In addition, we generated double-digit revenue growth from Apple TV and accessories during the quarter. Our retail and online stores produce their best June quarter revenue ever, with double-digit revenue growth across Apple Watch, iPad, Mac and accessories. Our trade-in program is showing great momentum, with more than 5x the number of iPhones traded in compared to a year ago. We opened stunning new stores in the Carnegie Library in Washington D.C. and the busy Shinji District in Taipei as well as a beautiful new location in the Dallas Galleria. We ended the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries alongside our online store presence in 35 countries. In the enterprise market, we are gaining traction with our strategy of transforming major industries by expanding our leading positions in key functional areas to grow our reach and modernize customer and employee experiences. In the financial services industry, 90 of the largest 100 banks by assets size are deploying Apple products to improve efficiency and effectiveness across their organizations. iPhone and iPad are overwhelmingly the preferred mobile devices for bankers on the go. For example, 60% of the biggest banks are supporting iPads for wealth managers. In retail banking, two-thirds of top banks are deploying iPad for branch transformation and modernizing legacy interfaces with a unified iPad experience. One of the world's largest banks created an iPad suite that reduced customer on-boarding time from more than an hour to just 12 minutes. Bank branch employees are also using Apple Watch for communication and notifications and Apple TV for customer presentations from iPads using AirPlay. Financial institutions also tell us that they receive positive feedback from leveraging Apple solutions for direct customer engagement. American Express, Credit Suisse, Discover and T.D. Ameritrade have launched Apple Business Chat as a dynamic way to support and interact with customers. The intuitive interface of messages on iOS enables rich communication between customers and contact center staff. T.D. Ameritrade has also become the first brokerage in the world to enable immediate funding of accounts using Apple Pay, eliminating the 2 to 3 business days it used to take to fund accounts by wire transfer. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $211 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and reduced commercial paper by $2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $102 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the quarter, including $17 billion through open-market repurchases of almost 88 million Apple shares and $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $61 million and $64 billion. This guidance includes almost $1 billion of year-over-year negative impact from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OINE to be about 200 million and we expect our tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2019 to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2019. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please.\nOperator: The first question will come from Amit Daryanani from Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess, two from me. First off, could you just talk about, when I think about the September quarter guide, it's implied I think up 16% or so sequentially. Historically, at least, in that guide has been in the 10% low double-digit kind of range. Just can you help us understand, what gives you the confidence for a better than seasonal guide in September, either from a geo or product basis would be helpful.\nLuca Maestri: Amit, it's Luca. Of course, this is our best estimate of where we think we will land. Clearly, we expect to have continued strong growth from the non-iPhone categories. We have great momentum in wearables. We mentioned that we were up almost 50% in the June quarter, or actually over 50% in the June quarter. Our services business, we set an all-time record in June. And so, these two categories have become really important and really large for us. And so, as we continue to grow, quickly that is going to help us as we go through the year. Keep in mind that the guidance includes an estimated almost $1 billion of foreign exchange headwind for the quarter.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. That's really helpful. And I guess if I just follow-up on China, impressed to see the continued recovery you guys are seeing that despite all the headlines that are out there. Just curious, what are the few things that are driving the success in China, and how sustainable do you think those changes are for Apple as you go forward.\nTim Cook: Yes, Amit, Hi. It's Tim, and I apologize for my voice, I'm suffering from an allergy. But what happened last quarter in China was a confluence of things. The government stimulus, this came in terms of a VAT reduction, a very bold one. We took some pricing action, we instituted our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores and worked with certain channel partners on that as well. And we're seeing a growing engagement with the broader Apple ecosystem during the quarter. And so, when you look at it, each of our categories, iPhone, iPad, Mac, wearables, services, everything improved sequentially. So, we couldn't be happier with the progress. I would point out, I think I mentioned in my comments, that we actually grew in constant currency for Greater China and we grew in Mainland China on a reported basis. So, there's several things going on there that are quite positive.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Can you talk a bit about what's going on within services, some of the puts and takes? Luca, you gave us some color in terms of the growth rates in that, but I'm just curious and I know you won't talk about future products, but as you think about the opportunity, you think about what you've got now and in the future and then some of what\u2019s been going on with China and that, is this something that could reaccelerate, or again, the 18% on a constant currency basis is obviously quite strong. But, how are you thinking about it?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. I think it's important to start with that 18% in constant currencies, Shannon. Our reported results are on a normalized basis, removing the one-time item from last year, was 15%. Clearly FX, plays a role around the world, 300 basis points of FX impact during the June quarter. In spite of that, it was an all-time record revenue. Our installed base continues to grow. It's growing in every geography and it's growing across all our major product categories, and that is very, very important for the services business. I would say, I'll give you a bit more color around two offsetting factors around this performance during the June quarter. On one side, the App Store, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that growth accelerated sequentially. We had double-digit growth on the App Store in every geography. In China, we saw significant acceleration. As you know, we tend to monetize in China on the App Store through game titles and the government has approved a few key game titles during the quarter. That has helped our performance there. On the other side, AppleCare, I mentioned AppleCare was an all-time record in June, so really strong performance, but our growth has decelerated in AppleCare due to factors that we fully expected, because we are comping this expansion of our coverage for AppleCare that we've had significant success during the last 18 to 24 months in really broadening our coverage of AppleCare around the world with some key partners, carriers and resellers. And obviously, as we go through the year those comps become a bit more difficult. Having said all that, that we've given ourselves a couple of targets and we feel very confident about reaching those targets. The first one is that, we wanted to double the size of the services business from our fiscal 2016 to 2020. We are on our way there. Paid subscriptions is another target, is important to us. It's an important way for us to monetize our ecosystem. We set a target of surpassing 0.5 billion paid subscriptions on the ecosystem during 2020. We\u2019re already at 420 million now. So, we feel confident there. And of course, as you mentioned, we're very excited about the fact that we're going to be launching new services soon. As Tim said, we're starting the rollout of Apple Card in August, and there's two more very important services that we\u2019re going to be adding to our portfolio during the fall. One is Apple Arcade, which is our gaming subscription service, and then of course Apple TV+, which is our video streaming service. So obviously these services will help us carry on with the momentum that we had in services.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you. And this is probably for you too as well, Luca. Can you talk about gross margin? The guidance was pretty solid. Obviously, there are various things that are at play here. I know you mentioned $1 billion worth of top-line impact, I think from, currency last quarter. Then maybe if you can kind of talk about what went into your gross margin guidance.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So of course, Shannon, as you've seen, our guidance for margin is 50 basis points higher than the guidance that we had given for June. I would say on the positive, we expect to benefit from leverage. As you've seen from our revenue guidance, and from cost savings, because as you know the commodity environment is fairly favorable right now. On the negative side, the headwind on gross margins on a year-over-year basis from foreign exchange is about 100 basis points. And so, we need to keep that in mind. But we feel pretty good about the guidance we provided.\nNancy Paxton: Thanks Shannon. Could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Yes. Thank you. I'd like to go back to the discussion around strength in China in the quarter and understand what linearity looked like. I ask because there was some industry data around the smartphone market in China that seemed to deteriorate in the month of June, the App Store data deteriorated a little bit in June, and just curious if that\u2019s something you saw in the business and if it at all informs your outlook around the pace of the China business as you go into September.\nTim Cook: Katy, it's Tim. We obviously took into account all of the information that we had and coming out with the guidance including linearity across last quarter and how this quarter has started. And so, we obviously look at that in quite much detail.\nKaty Huberty: And then just on the App Store, appreciate there's not a lot of detail out around exact timing and even some pricing of the new services, but how should we think about the new services that launched in March impacting the overall services growth. Does that start to benefit the model in the back half of this calendar year, or will the impact be more longer term in nature and really show up in 2020?\nLuca Maestri: Katy, let me just talk about the new services that we've announced in March, and then also about the timing of how we get to revenue, right? We've announced Apple News+, and this is the service that is available for consumers right now. We've announced our channel service, which has also become available a few weeks ago. The other three services, the card is launching in August, the gaming service and the video service are starting in the fall. Keep in mind for all these services, there's a trial period up front, there's going to be different trial periods, we'll see what that what they look like. So, the road to monetization takes some time. Obviously, all of them will add to our base and will help us with growth rates as we get into next year.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.\nKrish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, on the iPhone trade-in program, how effective was it and what percentage of the iPhone sales came from the trade-ins and are there any other geographies where you are left to rule it out? Then, I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Hi, it's Tim. In retail, it was quite successful. We got going in a larger way during that quarter, we were pretty much just ramping in the previous quarter. And trade-in as a percentage of their total sales is significant and financing is a key element of it. Those two things in the aggregate led the combination of retail and online, just short form that is retail Apple Store let to growth in June trajectory. We are obviously taking those programs and advocating those more widely and that is at different levels of implementation throughout different geographies. Because we're working with our carrier partners on those and retail partners.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. That's pretty helpful, Tim. And then, a follow-up for you, a much longer-term question. I understand we're in the very early innings of the services growth story. Is there a way to think about it down the road, 3 or 5 years down the road, would the services growth still be tethered to the hardware of the iPhone, or do you think at some point down the road services would be independent by itself and not really tied to your hardware installed base?\nTim Cook: Well, there are elements today that are not necessarily tethered to iPhone, right? We have other products where people are both purchasing things, they're watching Apple TV. We offer Apple Music on Android, and so there's a series of things that are outside of that. And so we'll see what we do in the future. I don't want to really get into that. But, more broadly, to answer your question about growth as we go forward, the way I see it is, we have the strongest hardware portfolio ever, we've got new products on the way, the pipeline is full of great new stuff both on the product and the services side. We're very fortunate and work very hard to have loyal customers and to continue attracting an impressive number of switchers. The installed base is growing, hit a new record, that's obviously good. And it hit a new record across all geographies and across all categories. And so, this is a really good thing. And we've got the Wearables area that is doing extremely well. We stuck with that when others perhaps didn't and really put a lot of energy into this and a lot of R&D and are in a very good position today to keep playing out what's next there. At the same time, on the market side, we have emerging markets where we have low penetration. And during the quarter tactically the emerging markets had a bit of a rebound. And in fact, on a constant currency basis, we actually grew slightly in emerging markets. We still declined on a reported basis. India bounced back. During the quarter, we returned to growth there. We're very happy with that. We grew in Brazil as well. We're also continuing to focus on the enterprise market. Luca mentioned some of this in his comments and we think that continues to be a big opportunity for us. And then, we've got lots of what I would call core technology kinds of things like augmented reality, where we're placing big bets and bet that we have a big future, in addition to the health kinds of things that may fall out of the watch. And so hopefully that kind of gives you a view over the total. And so, we're focusing on products and services and there will be some services that aren't hooked and some that are hooked not on current period sales mostly, very much services are rarely connected on that today or at least not a high percentage by any means there. They're more correlated to the active installed base and also the level of transacting customers that are there and the amount per customer, which relates also to the offering that we have.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Krish. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next, we will go to Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim, the China trade situation remains sort of fluid over here and more recently you asked for some tariff exceptions were not granted those. How are you thinking about the longer-term footprint for manufacturing and can you talk about any potential alternatives that you've looked at and considered in moving parts of production potentially out of China. And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes. I know there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different moves and so forth. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those, if I were you. The way I view this is, the vast majority of our products are kind of made everywhere. There's a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union also contributes a fair amount. And so, that's the nature of a global supply chain. Largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well. In terms of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S., we want to continue doing that. And so, we're working and investing currently in capacity to do so, because we want to continue to be here. And so that's what's behind the exclusions. And so, we're explaining that and hope for a positive outcome.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim. And there is, Luca, maybe for you, there's been some significant destocking of inventory in the first calendar half of this year in iPhone. Can you comment about the broader channel inventory levels where you are in your typical ranges, especially given the comment around June iPhone sales being quite strong and do you expect anything atypical in channel inventory dynamics in the September quarter? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Wamsi, as you know we're not getting into this topic very much. But, I think I can give you some color here. You know that in general, we decrease our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter. That has been traditionally what we've done. This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year and that is true in total and it's true for Greater China as well. So, we feel very good about our channel inventory ranges as we get into the September quarter. Hope that helps you with that.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thanks very much. The first question is probably to Tim and second one for Luca. I will ask them at the same time, so you can continue which other one you want to answer, first or second. While the first one is for Tim, regarding the installed base comment you've made, which is quite encouraging, but yet when you look at the iPhone revenue year-over-year the past several quarters have been down. Can you help us bridge the gap of, how is the installed base growing? Is it mostly because secondary users are the new ones coming into the system as people are holding more phones longer? And what does that user typically bring in with them or something unique relative to what we historically know? And then for Luca, you've been investing a lot, a lot, lot and a lot of these services are now coming to pass whether it be AppleCare, Apple Cloud, all these wearables and soon Apple Pay and Arcade. Are we at a point where now a lot of harvesting is going to happen or do you kind of continue this relatively same investment that you've been doing for the future strategy. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Hey, Jim, it's Tim, I'll start with your installed base question. Installed base is a function of upgrades and the time between those. It's a function of the number of switchers coming into the to the iOS, macOS and so forth [indiscernible]. It's a function of the robustness of the secondary market, which we think overwhelmingly hits an incremental customer. And it's a function still in the emerging markets and somewhat developed markets to a lesser degree of people knew that they\u2019re buying their first smartphone. There are still quite a few people in the world in that category. And so, the reason that the installed base doesn't correlate to the 90-day clock is that what's happening underneath the numbers is, switchers are still a very key piece of what's going on. The secondary market is very key, and we're doing programs et cetera to try to increase that, because we think we wind up hitting a cost number that we don't hit in another way. And the upgrades where people are holding onto their device a bit longer than they were, they're staying in the ecosystem. And then, you have the people in the new category as well. And so, that's sort of the equation. I don't want to go into the specific numbers, but I think you can see readily, mathematically, how the installed base is growing in an environment where the iPhone revenue is declining within a 90-day kind of window.\nLuca Maestri: And Jim, on OpEx, obviously is very important for us to continue to invest in the business, particularly on the R&D side, because we will always want to bring more innovation into the market. We want to improve the user experience and differentiate our products and services in the marketplace. So, we will continue to do that. There are some types of investments, of course, that are very strategic for us and they will have long-term implications. You've seen the announcement that we made around the Intel acquisition. Very important strategically for us. It requires upfront investment, of course. As you've seen from this quarter and also from the past, we will continue to run our SG&A portion of OpEx tightly. Of course, we'll continue to invest in marketing and advertising. We talked about a lot of new services that we are launching during the fall and Apple Card next month, obviously they will require the appropriate level of marketing and advertising as we launch them to the general public. When you look in total, where we are in terms of our expense to revenue ratio for operating expenses, you know, quite well that we are extremely competitive relative to other tech companies. So, we want to continue to be competitive and at the same time we will not under-invest in the business.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Jim. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start-off with the announcement at WWDC around the independent App Stores for the Watch and the iPad. What level of interest have you seen from developers and how are they thinking about the ability to monetize services independently on those App Stores? And how does that help you position wearables more firmly into the health and fitness category?\nTim Cook: We're seeing good interest across virtually everything that we announced at WWDC. I couldn't be happier with it. The developer tools around ARKit and AR in general that I went through earlier, lots of interest there, lots of interest from the Watch App Store, to the Catalyst that will be released with macOS Catalina, which allows developers quickly to port a iOS app to the Mac. We think this is huge and so great for the user experience. And so, you look at all of these and all the things that I talked about earlier and I couldn't be happier with the reception that we're getting and the work that is going on behind the scenes right now for the developers readying their apps for the fall.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. If I can just follow-up on the China market, one of the things that we're looking at is going into the New Year into 2020 there'll be a lot of 5G phones launching in that market from the Android players. How do you think about the competitive landscape there as you enter next year?\nTim Cook: We don't comment on future products. With respect to 5G, I think most people would tell you, we're in sort of the extremely early innings of it. And even more so on a global basis. So, we couldn't be more proud of what our lineup is and we're excited about the great pipeline of both hardware and software and we wouldn't trade our position for anyone's.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Samik.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This has been an exciting and productive quarter for Apple. In my letter to investors at the beginning of January, I wrote that one of Apple's great strengths is our culture of flexibility, adaptability, and creativity. This quarter featured some important announcements that speak to the power of our commitment to innovation and long-term thinking. I'd like to start with some top-line highlights and then move into greater detail with you.  I'll get started with financial results. Our revenue was $58 billion toward the high end of our guidance range. We see this result as a positive outcome in light of ongoing headwinds from weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. In constant currency, our year-over-year revenue performance would have been 200 basis points better than our reported results indicate. We had great results in a number of areas across our business. It was our best quarter ever for Services with revenue reaching $11.5 billion. We had a blockbuster quarter for iPad, with revenue up 22% from a year ago. This is our highest iPad revenue growth rate in six years. And it was another sensational quarter for Wearables with growth near 50%. This business is now about the size of a Fortune 200 company, an amazing statistic when you consider it's only been four years since we delivered the very first Apple Watch. I'll talk more about these categories later. While we grew year-over-year in developed markets, and while we had record March quarter results in a number of major markets including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, we did experience a revenue decline in emerging markets. But we feel positive about our trajectory. Our year-over-year revenue performance in Greater China improved relative to the December quarter, and we've seen very positive customer response to the pricing actions we've taken in that market, our trade-in and financing programs in our retail stores, the effects of government measures to stimulate the economy, and improved trade dialog between the United States and China. Our App Store results are still reflecting the impact of the slowdown in regulatory approval in gaming apps in China, but we're encouraged by the recent increase in the pace of approvals. We believe strongly in our long-term opportunity in China, thanks to our robust ecosystem, our talented developer community, and the country's growing population of tech-savvy consumers who value the very best products and services. For iPhone, while our worldwide revenue was down 17% from a year ago, declines were significantly smaller in the final weeks of the March quarter. Looking back at the past five months, November and December were the most challenging, so this is an encouraging trend. We like the direction we're headed with iPhone and our goal now is to pick up the pace. Importantly, our active installed base of devices continues to grow in each of our geographic segments, and set a new all-time record for all major product categories. That growing installed base is a reflection of the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, and it's driving our Services business to new heights. In fact, we had our best quarter ever for the App Store, Apple Music cloud services, and our App Store search ad business, and we set new March quarter revenue records for AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Pay transaction volume more than doubled year-over-year, and we're on track to reach 10 billion transactions this calendar year. Apple Pay is now available in 30 markets, and we expect to be live in 40 markets by the end of the year. More and more transit systems are accepting Apple Pay and New York's MTA system will begin the rollout in early summer. As we've seen in places like London, Tokyo, and Shanghai, contactless entry into transit systems helps to spur broader Apple Pay adoption, and we believe this will get even more people using Apple Pay in the United States. And Ticketmaster has just announced that they will be accepting Apple Pay for ticket purchases on the web and through the Ticketmaster app, and over 50 of their entertainment and sporting event venues are launching contactless tickets this year, including the vast majority of NFL stadiums. Subscriptions are a powerful driver of our Services business. We reached a new high of over 390 million paid subscriptions at the end of March, an increase of 30 million in the last quarter alone. This was also an incredibly important quarter for our Services moving forward. In March, we previewed a game-changing array of new services, each of them rooted in principles that are fundamentally Apple. They're easy to use. They feature unmatched attention to detail. They put a premium on user privacy and security. They're expertly curated, personalized, and ready to be shared by everyone in your family. These features aren't just nice to have. They actually help to eliminate the boundary between hardware, software, and service, creating a singularly exceptional experience for our users. First, building on the great momentum of Apple News, which is already the number one news app in the United States and the United Kingdom, we launched Apple News+. It will bring together over 30 popular magazines, leading newspapers, and digital publishers into a beautiful, convenient, and curated experience within the Apple News app. Apple News+ builds on our commitment to supporting quality journalism from trusted sources, while providing the best magazine and news reading experience ever for mobile devices. Advancing our vision to replace the wallet, we announced Apple Card built on principles Apple stands for like transparency, simplicity, and privacy. Apple Card is integrated into the Wallet app and delivers all new experiences that only Apple can provide integrating our hardware, software and services in an elegant solution that places the customer at the center. It's the first card to encourage you to pay less interest, eliminate fees, and give you daily cash on all your purchases and customer interest to date has been terrific. We also previewed Apple Arcade, the world's first game subscription service for mobile, desktop, and the living room. With over 100 new games, all with no ads or ad tracking, no additional purchases, and respect for user privacy, we've created a service for players of all ages, kids to teens to adults and one that families can enjoy together. The App Store is already the world's biggest gaming platform and we think Apple Arcade is a great way to unleash the creativity of the game developer community with a collection of new games not available on any other mobile platform or in any other subscription service. We can't wait for our customers to experience it for themselves beginning this fall. We were thrilled to provide a peek at what's new for TV. Beginning in mid-May, the all-new Apple TV app will bring together the different ways to discover and watch shows, movies, sports news, and more in one app across iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Mac, smart TVs, and streaming devices. And users can subscribe to and watch new Apple TV channels like HBO Showtime and Starz paying only for services they want all on-demand available on and offline. And coming this fall, Apple TV+ will be the new home for the world's most creative storytellers featuring exclusive original shows, movies, and documentaries. We also had several major product introductions during the quarter. We launched a new, more powerful iMac with dramatic increases in both compute and graphics performance, making it a great update for consumers and pros alike. For our Mac business overall, we faced some processor constraints in the March quarter leading to a 5% revenue decline compared to last year, but we believe that our Mac revenue would have been up compared to last year without those constraints and don't believe this challenge will have a significant impact on our Q3 results. For iPad, we were very happy to return to growth in Greater China while generating strong double-digit growth in each of our other geographic segments. Our great iPad results were driven primarily by strong customer response to iPad Pro. Late in the quarter, we launched an all-new iPad Air with an ultra-thin design, Apple Pencil support, and high-end performance powered by Apple's A12 Bionic chip. In addition, we introduced a new iPad Mini, a major upgrade for iPad fans who love an ultra-portable design and like the new iPad Air, it delivers the power of the A12 Bionic and support for Apple Pencil. Last month, we introduced new AirPods, the second generation of the world's most popular wireless headphones and demand has been incredible. This is nothing less than a cultural phenomenon. With the new Apple-designed H1 chip, the new AirPods deliver faster connect times, more talk time, and the convenience of hands-free Hey Siri. Our retail and online stores continue to be a key point of innovation. As we mentioned in January, we've been working on an initiative to make it simple to trade in a phone in our store, finance the purchase over time, and get help transferring data from the old phone to the new phone. As part of this initiative, we rolled out new trade-in and financing programs in the U.S., China, the U.K., Spain, Italy, and Australia. The results have been striking. Across our stores, we had an all-time record response to our trade-in programs and with more than 4 times the trade-in volume of our March quarter a year ago. With each passing quarter, we're more inspired by the impact our products are having on people's fitness and health. This quarter, we brought the ECG app on Apple Watch Series 4 to Hong Kong and 19 European countries including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the U.K. Just like when the ECG app launched in the United States, there's hardly a day that goes by that I don't get a letter or an e-mail from a customer in one of these countries talking about how this feature has significantly changed their life. We believe we're really just beginning to tap into what we can do to help our users actively manage their health and well-being. For example, last month Stanford Medicine reported results of the Apple Heart Study, the largest study ever of its kind, which enrolled over 400,000 participants from all 50 states in a span of only eight months. And hundreds of institutions are now supporting health records on iPhone with recent additions including Michigan Medicine and UT Health Austin. In February, we announced that we are working with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to make health records on iPhone available to veterans. This will be the first record sharing platform of its kind available to the VA, which is the largest medical system in the U.S. providing service to more than nine million veterans across more than 1,200 facilities. Apple's innovation extends beyond the impact we have in the lives of our customers to the impact we leave on the world around us. We recently marked Earth Day with several major announcements about our efforts to leave the world better than we found it. We've completed the allocation of our $2.5 billion green bond proceeds across 40 environmental initiatives around the world to projects ranging from solar power generation to water conservation to development of custom alloys for our products made from 100% recycled aluminum. We've announced a major expansion of our recycling programs, including quadrupling the number of locations where U.S. customers can send their iPhones to be disassembled by Daisy, our recycling robot. Each Daisy can now disassemble 1.2 million devices per year, allowing recovered materials to be recycled into the manufacturing process. And we partnered with a record number of our suppliers to follow our lead and transition to 100% clean energy. With the help of these 44 suppliers, we will exceed our goal of bringing four gigawatts of renewable energy into our supply chain by 2020 with over one additional gigawatt projected within that time frame. In the last calendar year alone, the partners that have joined this effort have generated enough clean energy to power over 600,000 homes in the United States. We're very proud of the progress that we and our partners are making, and hope our actions will inspire other businesses to do what they can to protect the world that we share. We are as excited as ever about our great pipeline of hardware, software and services and we're looking forward to sharing more information about the future of our four software platforms at our Worldwide Developer Conference now less than five weeks from now. Everyone here is hard at work to prepare for WWDC, and it's always a privilege to get to share the future of our platforms with the community of world changing developers who bring it to life. You are not going to want to miss this one. We're in the fortunate position of generating more cash than we need to run our business and invest confidently in our future, so today we're announcing the latest update to our capital return program including an increase to our share repurchase authorization and our quarterly dividend. For more details on that and our March quarter results, I'll turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue in the March quarter was $58 billion near the high end of the guidance range that we provided 90 days ago and down 5% from last year. Our revenue decline reflects 200 basis points of negative foreign exchange, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. Overall, products revenue declined 9% driven primarily by iPhone, while Services revenue grew 16% to a new all-time record. We also set a new March quarter record for Wearables Home and Accessories, and we recorded our best iPad growth rate in six years. Company gross margin was 37.6% in line with our guidance. Products gross margin was 31.2% down about 310 basis points sequentially due to the seasonal loss of leverage and headwinds from foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 63.8%, up 100 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and leverage from higher revenue. Net income was $11.6 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.46 and operating cash flow was $11.2 billion. Let me provide more color for our various revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $31.1 billion. We're seeing positive customer response to recent pricing actions in certain emerging markets, as well as enhancements to our trade-in and financing programs. And our year-over-year performance improved relative to our December quarter results in Greater China, in the Americas and in Japan. Our active installed base of iPhone reached a new all-time high at the end of March. This growing installed base reflects the industry leading satisfaction and loyalty of our customers. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among business buyers, who plan to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 81% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to Services. As Tim said, it was our best quarter ever with $11.5 billion in revenue, an increase of 16% from last year. We generated double-digit revenue growth across the App Store, Apple Music, cloud services, AppleCare, Apple Pay and our App Store search ad business. And we set all-time services revenue records in four of our five geographic segments. We're very happy with this performance. As you can see from our new disclosures, Services accounted for 20% of our March quarter revenue and about one-third of our gross profit dollars. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital content stores reached another new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts, also setting a new all-time record and growing by strong double-digits over last year. And we now have over 390 million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus just 12 months ago. All subscription categories are growing strong double-digits and as we mentioned a quarter ago, we expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 2020. On the App Store, our subscription business is extremely diversified and is growing strongly around the world. In fact, the number of paid third-party subscriptions increased by over 40% compared to last year in each of our geographic segments. And across all third-party subscription apps, the largest accounted for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was $5.5 billion compared to $5.8 billion a year ago with the decline driven primarily by processor constraint on certain popular models. In spite of this challenge, we generated double-digit Mac revenue growth in Japan and Korea setting new all-time Mac revenue records in both markets. On a global basis, nearly half of the customers purchasing Macs during the quarter were new to Mac and the active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high. We had great results for iPad with $4.9 billion in revenue and growth accelerating from the December quarter to 22%. iPad revenue grew in all five of our geographic segments, with a return to growth in Greater China and strong double-digit growth in all other segments. We had our best March quarter ever for iPad in Japan, and we were especially pleased by performance in Korea, Thailand and Mexico where revenue more than doubled over last year. In total, over half of the customers purchasing iPads during the March quarter were new to iPad and the iPad active installed base also reached a new all-time high. iPad revenue growth has been fueled primarily by the great customer response to our new iPad Pros. These completely redesigned iPads with full-screen Liquid Retina display, Face ID, powerful A12X Bionic chip with Neural Engine and support for the new Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard make iPad Pro the perfect PC laptop replacement for both consumers and professionals. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall. Among customers who plan to purchase tablets 77% of consumers and 75% of businesses plan to purchase iPads. Wearables Home and Accessories revenue set a new March quarter revenue record of $5.1 billion fueled primarily by the strong performance of our Wearables business, which grew close to 50%. Within this category, Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world and produced its best results ever for a non-holiday quarter. It's reaching many new customers with three quarters of purchases going to customers who have never owned an Apple Watch before. Interest in AirPods has been off the charts and we're working hard to catch up with the incredible customer demand. Turning to our retail and online stores. We generated very strong double-digit revenue growth from Apple Watch and iPad. We also announced 50 new Today at Apple sessions during the quarter in three new and expanded formats Skills, Walks and Labs free at our stores around the world. We're making important progress in the enterprise market, helping transform major industries. We're building on Apple's leading position in key functional areas to expand our reach and share within large accounts. Aviation is a strong example of this strategy at work. Across 450 airlines, iPad is overwhelmingly the preferred solution for the pilot's electronic flight bag. We've been making great progress expanding Apple's footprint beyond the cockpit into the cabin, where more than half of the top 50 airlines have now implemented iOS to enhance the guest experience as well as enable a new use case with mobile point-of-sale. We're also seeing traction with other mission-critical airline functions in ground operations and flight maintenance. For example, one of the largest airlines in the world tells us that the adoption of iPad has cut maintenance delays in half. Apple services are also making their way onboard, including growing adoption of Apple Pay for food and beverage purchases and in-flight access to Apple Music. We're also seeing significant iOS traction with large enterprise platforms which are the face of complex back-end systems to tens of millions of employees around the world. The end user employee experience is vital to engagement and productivity and with increasing mobility of today's modern workforce, those experiences are best on native iOS applications. We see great momentum through the growing number of iOS SDKs being delivered by the world's largest enterprise platforms. For instance, SAP's SDK for iOS continues to gain strong traction with their customers, growing by more than 40% in the last six months. And this past quarter Salesforce released its SDK enabling developers to build native iOS applications directly on top of the Salesforce platform. And finally, our enterprise channels continue to build momentum. In February, our Apple at Work initiative was launched with AT&T. This extension to our ongoing collaboration with AT&T will make it easy for more customers to choose the best Apple products for their needs in the enterprise and modernize their business. AT&T will enable business services for Apple products to help companies with their IT strategy, including device management, security, productivity and collaboration. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $225 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We also had $101 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position of almost $113 billion. As a result, we are in a very strong position that allows us to invest confidently in all areas of the business, while continuing to return value to our shareholders. Just last year, we announced a commitment to contribute more than $350 billion to the U.S. economy over the next five years, including the creation of 20,000 jobs. More recently, we've announced a major expansion in Austin Texas and in other cities across the country. All these efforts are essential investments to make sure that we're incorporating innovative ideas and top talent wherever they emerge. As we execute those initiatives, we are also able to return over $27 billion to investors during the March quarter. We began a $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program in February, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 55.1 million shares. We also repurchased 71.7 million Apple shares for $12 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents. Our priorities for cash have not changed over the years. Most importantly, we always want to maintain the cash we need to run our business, maintain strategic flexibility, and invest in our future. We're well on our way towards meeting the investment projections we laid out early last year. We also want to work towards a more optimal capital structure and as we said before, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. Given our confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, our Board has authorized an additional $75 billion for share repurchases. And because we know many of our investors value income, we're also raising our quarterly dividend for the seventh time in less than seven years to $0.77, an increase of about 5% from the previous amount. We paid over $14 billion in dividends and equivalents over the last four quarters alone, making us one of the largest dividend payers in the world. Going forward, we continue to plan for annual increases in dividends per share. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $52.5 billion and $54.5 billion. This guidance range comprehends 300 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact year-over-year. Also as a reminder, in the June quarter last year, our Services revenue included a favorable $236 million one-time item in connection with the final resolution of various lawsuits. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. We expect OpEx to be between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also reflecting the approved increase, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on May 16, 2019 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2019. With that, I would like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing in China? Clearly, it looks like things are improving sequentially. You also mentioned that last few weeks of the quarter, were stabilizing in emerging markets, I believe. So what are customers saying there and what are your partners saying in China? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Shannon. We're seeing -- in the iPhone space, we saw a better year-over-year performance in the last weeks of the quarter as compared to the full quarter or November and December, which was sort of a -- it appears to be the trough. I think there's a set of reasons for this. One, we made some price adjustments essentially backing out the weaker currency effect and then some. There's stimulus programs that the government has executed including -- and this happened in early April, VAT being reduced from 16% to 13%, so they've been aggressive in the stimulus side. Three, our trade-in and financing programs that we\u2019ve implemented in our retail stores have been very well received there, and I'm happy with the results to date there. And then four, there's an improved trade dialog between the U.S. and China. And from our point of view, this has affected consumer confidence on the ground there in a positive way. And so, I think it's a set of all of these things and we certainly feel a lot better than we did 90 days ago.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you. And then, I'm sure you're probably expecting a question on Qualcomm settlement. So what would you like to say on this settlement? How are you thinking about your component providers going forward? And how should we think about this with regard to -- I don't know your development plans in the future because I'm sure you're not going to talk about when you're going to do 5G, but clearly it helps that path. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah. Thank you, Shannon. We're glad to put the litigation behind us, and all the litigation around the world has been dismissed and settled. We're very happy to have a multi-year supply agreement, and we're happy that we have a direct license arrangement with Qualcomm, which was I know important for both companies, and so we feel good about the resolution.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, you talked about China responding well to these pricing actions that you've taken in that market. Do any of those learnings kind of carry through into how you decide pricing in the remaining emerging markets, like India, et cetera as you get ready for the next product cycle?\nTim Cook: We have made some adjustments in India, and we've seen preliminarily some better results there. Everything that we do does advise everything we do in the future, so we try to learn the best we can and hold [ph] that into our thinking, and we'll obviously do that with this as well.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. I just had a quick follow-up for Luca on the Services side. Luca, we see that you're guiding to higher operating expenses quarter-on-quarter. How much of that incremental is going in to support the new services that you're planning to launch later in the year?\nLuca Maestri: Yeah. Of course, we are supporting both our products and services business and you can see the trajectory of our OpEx over the different quarters. Clearly as we add new services, we will need to make the necessary investments to support them. Our Services business has multiple streams. In total, it is accretive to company gross margins. You've seen the latest -- we're running services margins at over 60%. So, it's a very important business for us in many ways for our ecosystem and for our ability to monetize it. And so, clearly we will make all the necessary investments to ensure that the new services are successful, and we're really encouraged by the level of customer response that we received so far in anticipation for the launch of these services.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Samik. Can we have the next question please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Luca, if I look back over the past five years, June quarter revenue typically declines about 15% from the March quarter. You're guiding to an 8% drop this year. So can you just talk about, which regions or product segments you think can outperform that typical seasonality?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Katy. And keep in mind by the way, we are reporting this guidance including a 300 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange, so actually in constant currency the numbers would be even stronger. At the product category level, we expect that we will continue to have strong revenue growth from the non-iPhone categories as we've had for the first half of our fiscal year. We're also expecting a relative improvement in our iPhone performance on a year-over-year basis in Q3 versus the first half. As Tim said, March was the strongest month of the quarter on a year-over-year basis and so this has given the confidence to provide the guidance that you've seen. Geographically, of course, as you've seen from our results for the March quarter, China is the geo where we found some challenges, but we believe the trajectory should improve over time.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, Shannon said you're not going to talk specifics around the timing of the 5G phone, but Tim maybe you can talk about how the company approaches a new technology like this given the higher cost but also potentially significant benefit, how you think about the right timing for coming to market with a product, with those characteristics? And then just generally how meaningful you think 5G is as a demand driver for upgrades in your iPhone installed base? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Katy, this is one that I'm going to largely punt on as you would probably guess. We look at a lot of things on the different technologies and try to look at the -- and select the right time that things come together and get those into products as soon as we can. And the -- certainly from a cost point of view there has been -- the technologies have had cost pressure over the last couple of years or so. On the flip side of that there's a number of things in the commodity markets going in the other direction at the moment like DRAM and NAND. And so it's difficult to project what happens next, but it's the aggregate of all of it that really matters from a price point of view.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. So we have the next question, please.\nOperator: Jim Suva from Citi has our next question.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. A topic that's probably split or shared by both Tim and Luca on a response, but I'll ask the question and you can decide how to divide it up. In your opening remarks, Tim, you'd mentioned about pricing adjustments that you made in some of the markets and then Luca talked also about the strength of the trade-in program or maybe it was Tim also. Can you help us understand about what type of lessons or elasticity you've learned about pricing and the trade-in programs of how it impacts like revenues and COGS and margins and things? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah. Jim, in the opening remarks I was really talking about China specifically. And I mentioned four things that I believe are responsible for the better year-over-year performance in the Q2 relative to Q1 and also the final weeks of March being better than the Q2 average. And those four are the price reductions, but that's one of them. But there are three others and one of the others is the trade-in and financing programs that we instituted in our retail stores. Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the -- many, many people do want to trade-in their current phone. It does -- from a customer user point of view the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself. And many people in literally every market that we've tried this in, there is a reasonable number of people that want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once. And so, it's a little different in each market in terms of what the elasticity is, but you can bet that we're learning quickly on all of those. The other two items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer. And the one that I got much visibility in -- that happened in early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%, so it's a very aggressive move. But there are other stimulus programs as well that likely have an effect to the consumer level. And then finally -- and this is not to be under weighted either -- I think the improved trade dialogue between the countries affects consumer confidence in a positive way. And so, I think it's sort of the sum of all of those things.\nLuca Maestri: And Jim, if I may add on the gross margin level as we look at pricing actions, of course, anytime you do a pricing action it is gross margin percentage diluted. But what really matters to us and what we look at -- when we look at the elasticity of these programs is to see the impact on our gross margin dollars. And what -- the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect and so that's what we think matters the most really.\nJim Suva: Thank you so much, gentlemen.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Jim. We have the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes. Thank you. Tim, you shared a lot of color around trade-ins, but I was also hoping maybe you can characterize what sort of dynamics you're seeing across your installed base on these trade-ins. What type of devices are being traded in? Is the profile of someone who has a really old iPhone? Or are you seeing folks that have newer iPhones trading in? And what sort of incentives are you providing beyond sort of the financing to drive that? And do you see this as something that can accelerate replacement cycles here over the next year or so? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: We're -- actually the product that's being traded in is all over the place, to be honest. It's 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus and then fewer 8 and 8 Plus. But there's some of each of those and so you get customers that are on the two-year cycle and customers -- some customers on the one-year cycle and then customers as well on the three and four-year cycles. And so it's really all over the place. In terms of the incentives we're offering currently in our retail stores a trade-in value that has -- that is more than the sort of the blue book of the device if you will for lack of a better description. And so we have topped those up to provide an extra benefit to the user. The installments are different in each geography. I would say that at the moment the geography that is doing the best in installments would be China. And we have a bit of a unique offering there I think versus the -- versus what you can get in the regular market and so that probably further helps there. And so you can bet that we're learning on each of these finding the parts that the user likes the most. I think the key is we're trying to build a -- build something into the consumer mindset that it's good for the environment and good for them to trade in their current device on a new device. And we do our best of getting the current device to someone else that can use that or in some cases if the product is at an end of life we are recycling the parts on it to make sure that it can carry on in another form.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks for the color Tim. And as my follow-up Luca can you just clarify if the settlement with Qualcomm is creating either a headwind or a tailwind to your gross margins in the near-term? And does your guidance contemplate incremental pricing actions that could be creating some gross margin headwinds? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: As Tim has explained we've reach this comprehensive agreement with Qualcomm. As part of this we have agreed that we're not going to share the financial terms of the agreement, so we plan to honor that. What you see in our gross margin guidance for the June quarter we guided 37% to 38% fully comprehends the outcome of the agreement with Qualcomm.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question please?\nOperator: Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray has our next question.\nMike Olson: Thanks for taking my question. So, you have more than 1.4 billion active devices and at your event you announced services that leverage that installed base. And you have obviously a remarkable position with kind of this Trojan horse of devices out in so many households. So, I guess, the question is and I know some of these services aren't even live yet but should we expect a continuation of the building out of new services categories like what we saw at the March event? Is there a pipeline of new services in the works? Or have we kind of seen what we're likely to see on that front for the near to intermediate term? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes, I wouldn't want to get into announcing things on the call, but obviously, we're always working on new things. And -- but we're right now we're really focused on getting these four out there. We have the News+ in the market today. We'll have the Apple Arcade and the Apple TV+ products in the market in the fall and Apple Card will go out in the summer timeframe. And so we've got lots in front of us and we're very excited about getting these out there.\nMike Olson: Right. And then you mentioned the App Store search ad business a couple of times in the prepared remarks. Is that reaching a point where it's become material and maybe moving the needle for overall services revenue? Or is there anything you can quantify related to that? I also imagine that this is a high-margin business at least maybe higher than the overall Services margin but wondering if you can confirm if that's the case or not. Thanks.\nTim Cook: It's growing very, very fast Mike. I think it was up around 70% over the previous year. We're expanding into new geographies as well and we still have more geographies out there that we think can move the dial further. So, it is a -- it's definitely a business that is big and getting bigger.\nA \u2013 Nancy Paxton: Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets.\nQ \u2013 Louis Miscioscia: Okay and thank you for taking my question. Tim, when you look at the four things that you have announced. And I realize they have different dates when they're coming out but, which ones would you say over the next 12 months has the most potential to help your Services line? And then maybe, which one has the best long-term potential? And then, I have a quick follow-up.\nA \u2013 Tim Cook: We're going to wait until we get these things out. And what I can tell you right now is that the -- we're taking sort of consumer interest on the Apple Card and there's been a significant level of interest on that and we're excited. As you know the -- gaming is the top category on the App Store. And so the Apple Arcade will serve some of that market. And it serves it with a different kind of game, which we think will be great for developers and great for users. The TV+ product plays in a market where it's -- there's a huge move from the cable bundle to over the top. We think that most users are going to get multiple over-the-top products. And we're going to do our best to convince them that the Apple TV+ product should be one of them. And then, we're working very hard to get everyone to give Apple News+ a look. Because we think it's a very unique product. And I love magazines. And we have really wanted to support the publishers. And so, we're working very hard to -- at the -- but at the very beginning of the ramp there. We wouldn't do a service\u2026\nQ \u2013 Louis Miscioscia: Okay, great.\nA \u2013 Tim Cook: \u2026that we didn't think could be meaningful. So that's sort of the way I look at it.\nQ \u2013 Louis Miscioscia: Great.\nA \u2013 Tim Cook: Yeah, these aren't hobbies.\nQ \u2013 Louis Miscioscia: Okay. A quick follow-up on India, obviously market share there is well below China. I believe you're looking to start manufacturing there. But what's the -- obviously the potential could be huge but the market already seems to be pretty dominated on the Android side, so maybe if you could just talk about trying to really aggressively ramp up share there. Thank you.\nA \u2013 Tim Cook: I think India is a very important market in the long-term. It's a challenging market in the short-term. But we're learning a lot. We have started manufacturing there which is very important to be able to serve the market in a reasonable way. And we're growing that capability there. And we would like to place retail stores there. And we're working with the government to seek approval to do that. And so, we plan on going in there with sort of all of our might. We've opened a developer, accelerator there, which we're very happy with some of the things coming out of there. It's a long-term play. It's not something that's going to be on overnight huge business. But I think the growth potential is phenomenal. It doesn't bother me that it's primarily Android business at the moment because that just means there's a lot of opportunity there.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Lou.

This isn't the first time you've heard from us regarding the December quarter, so the first thing I want to do is provide some final results and connect those back to the letter we shared at the beginning of the month. As you know, our December quarter revenue was below our original expectations, coming in at $84.3 billion. That's down 5% from a year ago, or down 3% adjusting for foreign exchange. We noted four factors that would impact our results when we provided guidance in November: different iPhone launch timing from a year ago, FX headwinds, supply constraints on certain products and macroeconomic conditions in emerging markets. One of those factors, weak macro conditions in some emerging markets was significantly more severe than we originally foresaw, especially in Greater China. As our letter noted, that challenge was compounded by quarterly iPhone upgrades that were lower than we anticipated. We'll return to upgrades in a moment, but I'd first want to say a bit more about our business in Greater China. Our revenue there was down by $4.8 billion from last year with declines across iPhone, Mac and iPad. Most of the shortfall relative to our original guidance and over 100% of our worldwide year-over-year revenue decline was driven by our performance in Greater China. Despite iPhone upgrades being lower than we anticipated, our business grew outside of China, including new records in the Americas, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and our rest of Asia Pacific segment. We had record performance in large markets, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Germany, Italy, Spain and Korea. In the letter we shared earlier this month, we said we are proud to participate in the Chinese marketplace and that we believe our business has a bright future there over time. But I think some of that got lost, so I want to share a bit more detail on the positives we see in China. We generated record December quarter services revenue in Greater China, fueled by an amazing ecosystem with over 2.5 million registered iOS developers. We saw very strong results from our wearables business there with revenues up over 50%. We also continued to grow our total active installed base by adding new customers. In fact, more than two-thirds of all customers in China who bought a Mac or an iPad during the December quarter were purchasing that product for the first time. Finally, for perspective, despite the challenging December quarter, our revenue from China grew slightly for the full calendar year. Macroeconomic factors will come and go, but we see great upside in continuing to focus on the things that we can control. Returning to iPhone, I'd like to talk about our results in the context of those lower than expected upgrades. iPhone XR, iPhone Xs, and iPhone Xs Max are by far the best iPhones we've ever shipped. They share advanced technologies including the A12 Bionic, the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone with our next-generation Neural Engine capable of 5 trillion operations per second. These are also completely modern iPhones with stunning large full screen displays and Face ID, the most secure authentication of any kind available in a smartphone. And the cameras are simply amazing with portrait mode and depth control to allow users to create studio quality photos as well as stunning 4K video, opening a whole new era of photography. We couldn't be more proud of our iPhone lineup and our industry-leading customer satisfaction. We wouldn't change our position for anyone. Now, our customers are holding on to their older iPhones a bit longer than in the past. When you pair this with the macroeconomic factors, particularly in emerging markets, it resulted in iPhone revenue that was down 15% from last year. Our iPhone results accounted for significantly more than our entire year-over-year revenue decline. In fact, outside of iPhone, our business grew strongly by 19%. So, what's behind this? It's important to understand what's going on from the customer perspective at the point of purchase. We believe that it's the sum of several factors. First, foreign exchange. The relative strength of the U.S. dollar has made our products more expensive in many parts of the world. In Turkey, for example, the lira depreciated by 33% over the course of calendar 2018 and in the December quarter, our revenue there was down by almost $700 million from the previous year. Second; subsidies. For various reasons, iPhone subsidies are becoming increasingly less common. In Japan, for example, iPhone purchases were traditionally subsidized by carriers and bundled with service contracts. Competitive promotional activity frequently increase the amount of subsidy during key periods. Today, local regulations have significantly restricted those subsidies as well as related competition. As a result, we estimate that less than half of iPhones sold in Japan in Q1 of this year were subsidized compared to about three quarters a year ago and that the total value of those subsidies had come down as well. Third, our battery replacement program. For millions of customers, we made it inexpensive and efficient to replace the battery and hold onto their existing iPhones a bit longer. Some people have suggested that we shouldn't have done this because of the potential impact on upgrades, but we strongly believe it was the right thing to do for our customers. What's very important, however, is that in spite of these factors, our total active installed base of devices has grown from 1.3 billion at the end of January of 2018 to 1.4 billion by the end of December reaching a new all-time high for each of the main product categories and for all five of our geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our fast-growing Services business. In fact Services revenue set an all-time record at $10.9 billion in the December quarter growing 19%. We not only generated our highest global Services revenue ever, but we also had all-time records across multiple categories of Services including the App Store, Apple Pay, cloud services and our App Store search ad business and we had a December quarter record for AppleCare. And I'm very proud to say that nearly 16 years after launching the iTunes Store, we generated our highest quarterly music revenue ever thanks to the great popularity of Apple Music now with over 50 million paid subscribers. The App Store wrapped up its best year ever with record holiday period results propelled by the biggest Christmas Day and Christmas week ever. Customers also spent over $322 million on New Year's Day alone setting us new single-day record for both the number of customers and purchase volume. It was also a great holiday season for Apple Pay with over 1.8 billion transactions in the quarter well over twice the volume of the year-ago quarter. Merchant adoption continues to reach new milestones. Customers can now use Apple Pay with iPhone and Apple Watch at nearly 3,000 Speedway locations, while all Target Taco Bell and Jack-in-the-Box stores will be accepting Apple Pay soon. We launched Apple Pay in three new countries in the December quarter Germany, Belgium and Kazakhstan and is now live in 27 markets around the world. The rollout in Germany has been a huge success with Deutsche Bank reporting more activations for Apple Pay in one week than for Android in an entire year. This is yet another example of what's possible when you bring together Apple's world-class hardware, software and ecosystem with our engaged and active user base. Shoppers around the world love Apple Pay and it has increasingly become an indispensable part of daily life. Revenue from cloud services continues to grow rapidly with year-over-year revenue up over 40% in the December quarter. And readership of Apple News set a new record with over 85 million monthly active users in the three countries where we've launched the United States, the U.K., and Australia. Here in the U.S., the latest data from Comscore shows that Apple News has the largest audience of all news apps. And the international audience will continue to grow with our first-ever bilingual launch in Canada available to customers later this quarter. In summary, we're very happy not only with the growth, but also the breadth of our Services portfolio. Our revenue from Services has grown from less than $8 billion in calendar 2010 to over $41 billion in calendar 2018. The largest category represents less than 30% of total Services revenue and the new services we've launched in the last few years are all experiencing tremendous growth. We had our best quarter ever for Mac revenue which was up 9% fueled by our new MacBook Air and Mac Mini introduced in October. The MacBook Air includes a beautiful new Retina display, Touch ID and Force Touch Trackpad while the new Mac mini provides a powerful, flexible solution for everything from home automation to giant render forms. iPad revenue was up 17%, its highest growth rate in almost six years powered by the new iPad Pro released in November with its edge-to-edge Liquid Retina display, Face ID and A12X Bionic chip, the new iPad Pro has been described by reviewers as a tablet with no equal and the most powerful mobile device ever made. We also had our best quarter ever for Wearables Home and Accessories with 33% growth in total and almost 50% growth from Wearables, thanks to strong sales of both Apple Watch and AirPods. We don't measure our success in 90-day increments. We manage Apple for the long term and when we consider the keys to our success over time there are three that stand out, our highly satisfied and loyal customers, our large and growing active installed base and at the heart of it all, our deeply ingrained culture of innovation. Thanks to all this our ecosystem is stronger than ever before. We have an amazingly talented team creating hardware, software and services, optimizing each of them to create an unparalleled user experience. Apple Watch is a powerful example of that. It's humbling to read e-mails from customers around the world telling us how Apple Watch has dramatically changed their lives by motivating them to be more fit and active, by alerting them to potentially serious health conditions such as AFib and by helping them in times of crisis with features like fall detection and emergency SOS. We believe we are just beginning to see the impact we can make to improving health and are deeply inspired by the possibilities. Another example is the work we're doing with silicon. We've embedded machine learning directly into the silicon with our A12 Bionic chip. Our custom Neural Engine not only provides power efficiency and incredible performance in a very small package, but it also enables processing of data and transactions directly on the device. This means iPhone can recognize patterns make predictions and learn from experience and it does all this while keeping personal information private. This is a powerful example of how innovation and privacy can go hand-in-hand at a time when these issues are increasingly important to our users. We are undertaking and accelerating a number of initiatives to improve our results. It's not in our DNA to just stand around and wait for macroeconomic conditions to improve. One such initiative is making it simple to trade in an iPhone in our stores and raising awareness of this opportunity. Because of the quality and durability of iPhones, they maintain significant residual value making trade-ins a great opportunity. It's not only great for the environment, it's great for the customer as their existing phone acts as a subsidy for their new phone and it's great for developers as a phone that is traded in and redistributed can help grow our active installed base. Beginning last week, we started making it easier for people to pay for their phones over time with installed payments and we're working on rolling out this program to more geographies as soon as we can. We are as confident as ever in the fundamental strength of our business and we have a very strong pipeline of products and services with some exciting announcements coming later this year. Apple innovates like no other company on earth and we are not taking our foot off the gas. We'll continue to invest through near-term headwinds just as we always have and we'll emerge stronger as a result. Now for more details on our December quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. As Tim said, revenue for the December quarter was $84.3 billion. This result was below our expectations, but we were able to set new all-time revenue records in the U.S., Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe and Korea. Our results were especially strong in the U.S. where revenue was up by more than $1.5 billion compared to a year ago and in several markets where revenue grew by double digits including among others Germany, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Malaysia and Vietnam. Looking at product categories. iPhone revenue declined 15% from a year ago while revenue from the rest of our business grew 19% to an all-time record, including our best results ever for Services, for Wearables and for Mac. Company gross margin was 38%. This quarter for the first time, we're making an important new disclosure to our investors as we believe it will foster a better understanding of our business. We are now reporting on a quarterly basis, gross margin for products in aggregate and for Services in aggregate. Products gross margin was 34.3% and Services gross margin was 62.8%. On a sequential basis, products gross margin increased 60 basis points due to positive leverage from the holiday quarter, partially offset by higher cost structures as we launched several new products and by headwinds from foreign exchange. Services gross margin also increased 170 basis points sequentially due to favorable mix and leverage, partially offset by foreign exchange. While both products and services gross margins improved sequentially, total company gross margin was down 30 basis points due to a different mix between products and services. Net income was $20 billion about flat to last year and diluted earnings per share were an all-time record at $4.18, an increase of 7.5% over last year. Operating cash flow was also very strong at $26.7 billion. Let me provide more color for the various products categories. iPhone revenue was $52 billion. On a geographic basis, most of the decline from last year came from Greater China and other emerging markets with difficult macro and foreign exchange conditions affected our results. We also believe that the reduction of carrier subsidies and our battery replacement program had an impact in a number of countries around the world. And as Tim mentioned we had a lower number of upgrades than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. However, our global active installed base of iPhones continues to grow and has reached an all-time high at the end of December. We are disclosing that number now for the first time. And it has surpassed 900 million devices, up year-over-year in each of our five geographic segments and growing almost 75 million in the last 12 months alone. We plan to provide information on the iPhone installed base as well as total installed base on a periodic basis. Customer satisfaction and loyalty for iPhone continue to be outstanding and are the highest in the industry. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone XR, XS and XS Max combined. And among business buyers who plan to purchase smartphones in the March quarter 81% plan to purchase iPhones. Based on the latest information from Kantar, iPhone experienced a 90% customer loyalty rating for iPhone customers in the U.S. 23 points above the next highest brand measured. Turning to Services. It was our best quarter ever with revenue of $10.9 billion, up 19% year-over-year with new December quarter records in all five of our geographic segments. Many Services categories set new all-time revenue records and we are on track to achieve our goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue by 2020. To be clear and as we've already explained 90 days ago, our 2020 goal remains unchanged and it excludes the impact of the revenue reclassification between products and services we recorded in connection with ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard that we adopted at the beginning of fiscal 2019. The level of engagement of our customers in our ecosystem continues to grow. The number of transacting accounts on our digital stores reached a new all-time high during the quarter with the number of paid accounts growing by strong double digits over last year. And we now have over 360 million paid subscriptions across our Services portfolio, an increase of 120 million versus a year ago. Given the continued strength and momentum in this part of the business, we now expect the number of paid subscriptions to surpass 0.5 billion during 2020. Our subscription business has become very large and diversified covering many different categories from entertainment to health and fitness to lifestyle. In fact, more than 30,000 third-party subscription apps are available today on the App Store and the largest of them accounts for only 0.3% of our total Services revenue. Next, I'd like to talk about the Mac. We saw great response to the new MacBook Air and Mac mini that we introduced in October, which helped drive a 9% increase in Mac revenue over last year to a new all-time record. Mac revenue was up in the vast majority of countries we track with double-digit growth in many large markets such as the U.S., Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Japan, Korea and South Asia. Our active installed base of Macs reached a new all-time high and half of all the customers purchasing Macs in the December quarter were new to Mac. We also had great results for iPad with revenue up 17% from a year ago. A strong performance of both iPad and iPad Pro and generated double-digit growth in four of our five geographic segments. Similar to the Mac, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high and among customers purchasing iPad during the quarter half were new to iPad. The most recent consumer survey from 451 Research measured a 94% customer satisfaction rating for iPad overall, with iPad Pro models scoring as high as 100%. Among business customers who plan to purchase tablets in the March quarter, 68% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables, home and accessories revenue grew 33% to a new all-time record in each of our geographic segments. Revenue from this category was up over $1.8 billion compared to a year ago, thanks to the amazing popularity of Apple Watch and AirPods both of which were supply constrained as we exited the quarter. Based on revenue over the past four quarters, our Wearables business is approaching the size of a Fortune 200 company. Our retail and online stores generated strong results for Mac and iPad and all-time record performance from Services and from Wearables. Following the launch of the new iPhone trade-in campaign, our stores more than doubled the volume of iPhones traded in compared to last year, reaching an all-time high in Q1. We added Thailand to our footprint with a beautiful store in Bangkok and we opened a stunning new store on Champs-Elysees in Paris exiting the quarter with 506 physical stores in 22 countries. In enterprise, across multiple industries our technology continues to enable businesses to do their best work. In healthcare, iPhones and iOS apps continue to streamline and support clinical workflows, communications and care delivery across leading health systems including Johns Hopkins Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Stanford Health Care and Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital. In manufacturing, SKF the world\u2019s largest producers of bearings and seals, has transformed their manufacturing processes on iOS and iPhone with incredible success. With custom iOS apps available to production operators across their worldwide locations, SKF has reduced production errors from 20 percent to zero while saving 70% in system-related time. Apple technology has made possible a simplified user experience integrating the SAP cloud platform, yielding better accuracy, efficiency, and employee experiences across the board. We\u2019re also seeing great innovation in the construction industry, with iPad and new third-party apps made for iOS. For instance, Procore Technologies has introduced an app to help decrease building errors on the job site. By using Metal in Split View with the iPad camera, construction workers can compare building plants and 3D models to what is actually being built in real time. This new iOS app reduces wasted raw materials and helps keep building projects on time and on budget. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $245 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We also had $102.8 billion in term debt and $12 billion in commercial paper outstanding, for a net cash position of $130 billion. As we explained in the past, it is our plan to reach a net cash neutral position over time. As part of this plan, we returned over $13 billion to our investors during the December quarter. We repurchased 38 million Apple shares for $8.2 billion through open market transactions and we paid $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents. Consistent with our historical cadence, we plan to provide an update on our overall capital return program when we report our March quarter results. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $55 billion and $59 billion. This range reflects a negative year-over-year impact of $1.3 billion from foreign exchange, which represents about 210 basis points of last year's revenue and a more uncertain macroeconomic environment than a year ago, especially in emerging markets. We expect gross margin to be between 37% and 38%. On a sequential basis, this range reflects seasonal loss of leverage and a 60 basis point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, partially offset by commodity cost savings. We expect OpEx to be between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $300 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 17%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.73 per share of common stock, payable on February 14, 2019 to shareholders of record as of February 11, 2019. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Luca. And we ask that you limit yourselves to two questions. And may we have the first question please?\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Services growth did decelerate from the growth rates in recent quarters, so can you talk about the factors that played into that slower growth? And then, appreciate the new disclosure around paid subscribers. But if you compare what you added in 2018 versus what you expect to add over the next two years, that implies a slowdown in annual net new subscribers. So should we be thinking about services as a lower growth segment than what you experienced in 2018? And then I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Katy, let me take that one. First of all, when we talk about the services business, it's very important to start from the momentum that we have. As you know, we have set an ambitious target for ourselves to double the size of our business from fiscal 2016 to 2020, which implied at the time a 19% CAGR. So far, we've been able to grow about 20%. In fiscal 2018, we grew 22%. So we are on track to achieve our objective. And it's important to understand what is driving the growth of the business. First of all, it's our installed base. As we just told you, the installed base continues to grow very nicely. It has reached 1.4 billion active devices at the end of December and really very little of our services revenue is driven by what we sell in the last 90 days. The second factor for the growth of the services business is that within this installed base the percentage of users who are paying for at least one service is growing very strongly. This is due to several factors. First of all, we're offering more and more services. During the last few years, as you know, we launched Apple Music, Apple Pay and advertising service for our developers on the App Store. All these businesses are growing very strongly. Second, we are making it easier for our customers to transact on our digital stores. We accept many more payment methods today which are very common in certain countries around the world. We've also increased the distribution coverage for many of these services. We're bringing AppleCare to more points of sale around the world. We are launching Apple Pay in more and more markets and so on. Thirdly, as you mentioned, our subscriptions are becoming a very large portion of our business and they're growing very well above services average. And the fact that we are saying that we will surpass 0.5 billion during 2020, we're not putting a specific date during 2020, but I think you've seen over recent quarters that we've been adding about 120 million on a year-over-year basis for a number of quarters now. And this is an incredible staggering number, right, when you think about it. We are also broadening the scope of many of these services. If you take Apple Pay as an example, it started off as the most convenient, most private and most secure way to make a payment in a store or in an app. Then we took Apple Pay to Safari, then we started a peer-to-peer service and we're launching it in new markets across the world every quarter, so we are broadening that scope. And of course, similar to what we've done in the past in the last three years, we launched several new services, we're also looking to launch new services going forward that we believe will provide great value to our users and we're really very excited about the opportunities that we see in front of us. I think you're referring to the deceleration in the growth rate that we've seen in the December quarter. And I think you're referring back to the growth that we reported in September. I think an important point I need to make, and I think it's helpful that you asked the question, is that a portion of this deceleration is truly just a reclassification of the amortization of free services that we've made in connection with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. And as we explained 90 days ago, this amortization of free services in the past was reported under Products and now gets reported under Services. The reclassification is actually dilutive to our growth rate because the amortization of free services is a relatively stable number, which gets applied to a growing base. So this reclassification reduces our growth rate versus the previous classification. This factor by itself represents roughly one-third of the deceleration that you're seeing. We talked about 27% growth in the September quarter. With the reclassification that growth rate was about 24.5%. So that explains about a third of that deceleration. There are, I would say three factors that explain this difference between the 24.5% to the 19%. The first one is that foreign exchange plays a role. Roughly 60% of our Services business is outside the United States. And as you know the U.S. dollar has appreciated in recent months. And in general, we tend not to reprice our services for foreign exchange on a very frequent basis. The second factor is a well-known issue around the App Store in China. The App Store in China is a large business for us. We believe this issue around the approval of new game titles is temporary in nature, but clearly is affecting our business right now. And then thirdly, we are seeing some level of deceleration in AppleCare, which has had very, very strong growth during fiscal 2018, where we're starting to lap some of the increase in distribution coverage that we put in place recently and the channel fill of Apple components that happened when we increase the distribution coverage. But in general, we are very, very pleased with 19% growth and we think that the business will continue to grow nicely going forward.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you for that color. Just a quick follow-up, Luca. Share repurchases in the December quarter were well below the run rate from the June and September quarters. How much did the weaker quarter play into your ability to carry out the buyback at the same level? And what should we think about is the right run rate going forward?\nLuca Maestri: Well, we've always said that we're very committed to executing our program. We have done almost $250 billion of repurchases from the beginning of the program. But we've also said that we want to execute the program in an efficient, effective, I will say, disciplined manner. And that takes into account also overall market conditions. So, that's what we did during the course of the December quarter. We -- our fundamental view remains the same. We are optimistic about our future and we think there is great value in our stock. And so we will continue to execute the program. We will continue to report at the end of every quarter. And by the way, when we report our March quarter results, we will also talk about the next step in our capital return program which is something that we do traditionally in the spring.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Milunovich: Great. Thank you very much. Some have the perception that you priced the new products, the new iPhones too high, what have you learned about price elasticity? And do you feel that perhaps you pushed the envelope a little bit too far and might have to bring that down in the future?\nTim Cook: Steve, it's Tim. If you look at what we did this past year, we priced the iPhone Xs in the U.S. the same as we priced the iPhone X a year ago. The iPhone Xs Max which was new was $100 more than the Xs. And then we priced the XR right in the middle of where the entry iPhone 8 and entry iPhone 8 Plus have been priced. So, it's actually a pretty small difference in the United States compared to last year. However, the foreign exchange issue that Luca spoke of in the call and -- made that difference or amplified that difference in international markets, in particular the emerging markets which tended to move much more significantly versus the dollar. And so what we have done in January and in some locations and some products is essentially absorbed part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year and therefore get close or perhaps right on the local price from a year ago. So, yes, I do think that price is a factor. I think part of it is that, the FX piece. And then secondly in some markets as I had talked about in my prepared remarks, the subsidy is probably the bigger of the issues in the developed markets. I had mentioned Japan, but also even in this country even though the subsidy has gone away for a period of time. If you're a customer that your last purchase was a 6s or 6 or in some cases even a 7, you may have paid $199 for \u2013 and now in an unbundled world it's obviously much more than that. And so we are working through those and we've got a number of actions to address that including the trade-in and the installment payments which I had mentioned as well.\nSteve Milunovich: I know that you're not giving units going forward, but you said you might make qualitative comments. I was wondering, if you have a comment particularly on the ASP on a year-over-year basis?\nLuca Maestri: Well Steve, we did mention on the call last quarter that the different timing of our phone launches would affect the year-over-year compares. If you remember, our top models the Xs and Xs Max shipped during the September quarter, which plays the channel fill and the initial sales in that quarter. While last year the iPhone X shipped in Q1 in the December quarter, plays in the channel fill and initial sales in the December quarter. So we knew that this would create a difficult compare for Q1 of 2019 and this is essentially what happened. It was pretty much in line with our expectations. To give you more color I would say that, the XR is our most popular model and it's followed by Xs Max and then the Xs.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Steve. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I have one for Luca and one for Tim. Luca, looks like the midpoint of your Q2 revenue guidance implies the steepest Q1 to Q2 sequential decline in iPhone revenues in history. It also implies a year-over-year deceleration in iPhone revenues. And I'm wondering, if you can comment about whether that's conservatism, whether you're entering the quarter with a high level of channel inventory and maybe you can comment explicitly on that, or whether you actually think the macroeconomic conditions are getting worse?\nLuca Maestri: Yeah. I mean three questions there. The first one is a question around conservatism. As we always do when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within. We've done pretty well with that up until the December quarter, right? I mean, we've been \u2013 we didn't miss in years and years. So that's the idea. There isn't a specific level of conservatism. We believe that this is the range where we're going to fall within. On channel inventory, as you know our historical pattern for iPhone channel inventory is that typically we increase inventory in Q1 and we decrease in Q2. And we think this year will be similar and we've exited the December quarter with levels of inventory that we are comfortable with. So that leaves us with the reality that our iPhone performance in Q1 from a revenue standpoint was minus 15%. And we expect that the key factors that Tim mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have an effect on Q2 starting with the strong U.S. dollar environment. On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact from currency is going to be about $1.3 billion, so that's about a bit more than two points versus last year's revenue and so that obviously plays a role. And the macroeconomic environment particularly in emerging markets will continue to be there. On the positive side, we expect that we will continue to grow revenue nicely from the rest of the business which is not iPhone.\nToni Sacconaghi: Okay. Tim, at your September event Lisa Jackson, an Apple VP, stated the company needed to quote design products to last as long as possible. And Apple's clearly doing that by helping with the battery replacement program, iOS working on an older range of products et cetera. But I guess the question is why doesn't that mean that replacement or upgrade cycles for iPhones should continue to extend going forward in part because that's almost one of your objectives? And maybe to that end, maybe you can help us understand what iPhones' average replacement cycle might be today, and how that may have changed over the last three to five years. And again, why wouldn't you expect it to elongate over time given some of the aforementioned things? Thank you.\nTim Cook: We do design our products to last as long as possible. Some people hold onto those for the life of the product and some people trade them in. And then that phone is then redistributed to someone else. And so it doesn't necessarily follow that one leads to the other. The cycles -- the average cycle has extended. There's no doubt about that. We've said several times I think on this call and before, that the upgrades for the quarter were less than we anticipated due to the -- all the reasons that we had mentioned. So, where it goes in the future, I don't know, but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality, that is the best thing for the customer and we work for the user. And so that's the way that we look at it.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the trajectory of Services gross margin, up about 500 basis points it appears year-over-year. You talked a little bit about sequential. But what's driving the improvement or will it be volatile as we go through the year depending on quarters and mix? Just whatever color you can give us as we start to forecast this? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Shannon. I think you've seen that Services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount. Let me start with sequential because I think it's probably most relevant for us. Sequentially, we increased 170 basis points. It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good support from our scale. Some of these services are scaling quickly and so we tend to expand gross margins there. And also, we had favorable mix. As you probably know, we have a very broad portfolio of Services. Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because of the way we account for them. For example, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue on a net basis and therefore the gross margins tend to be accretive. But we also have services that are very successful, that are below the average for the services business. And so depending on how these separate businesses do in the marketplace, we're going to be seeing some level of movement going forward on services margins. But you've seen that for the last 12 months they've gone up nicely 450 basis points and sequentially they've gone up 170 basis points. But I wouldn't draw necessarily a conclusion on how this services gross margin is going to move over time. We will report of course at the end of every quarter. But important to keep in mind, it's a broad portfolio with very different gross margin profiles within the portfolio. It is important for us to grow gross margin dollars. And if at times we grow services that are at a level of gross margins, which is below average, as long as this is good for the customer and as long as we generate gross margin dollars we're going to be very pleased.\nShannon Cross: Okay, thank you. And then Tim, can you talk a bit about video? You've signed a myriad of deals. There was announcement about -- there are TV app directly on Samsung. So perhaps when this comes out you'll be multi-platform. I'm just curious how you view the opportunity in video. And I guess assuming, you can just leverage the costs that you've made already, it should be accretive to margin I would think?\nTim Cook: Yeah, Shannon, we see huge changes in customer behavior taking place now. And we think that it will accelerate as the year goes by to sort of the breakdown of the cable bundle that's been talked about for years. And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year. And so we're going to participate in that in a variety of ways. One of those is through Apple TV and you're well familiar with that product. The second way is AirPlay 2, which we have as just pointed out we have support on a number of different third-party TVs. And we're excited about that. It makes the experience in the living room with people using our products even better. We think that people are really going to like that. Another way is, of course, all the third-party video subscriptions that are on the store. We are participating in this today. And I would guess that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle. And then finally, original content where we will participate in the original content world. We have signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah. But today I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point. We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence in and they're working really hard and we'll have something to say more on that later.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please?\nOperator: The next question will come from Walter Piecyk with BTIG.\nWalter Piecyk: Great, thanks. I just have a question on the free services. Can you just describe how the math works on that? Is it that the free services are non cash revenue that's getting booked in the Services revenue with no cost and then the costs come out of products? Can you just run us through what the current status versus how you were accounting for that before?\nLuca Maestri: Yes in essence when we sell a product at a certain price, we make an assumption. We estimate the value that can be associated to providing free services. In our case, it's providing Maps services, providing Siri and providing free iCloud to all the customers that purchase our product. And so we calculate an estimated value. That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services. In the past that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products. Now in connection with the new revenue recognition standard, we are reclassifying essentially that amortization from products revenue to services revenue. So total revenue has not changed, we just report that estimated value under the Services category. We also reclassify the cost that we need to incur to provide those services. So the gross margin rate of these services is clearly significantly dilutive to the overall Services margin. I hope I've...\nWalter Piecyk: So it did make services gross margin, got it. And then my other -- my second question is just, when you think about growth in Services, you have selling more to existing paid subscription customers or it's the 300 million going to 0.5 billion. If you can just talk at a high level as far as when you look at growth going forward, is it about -- what is the mix in terms of selling more to existing users, getting new users or -- and maybe some of the individual services that you see the biggest growth opportunity? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. I mean as I said I mean essentially what -- services -- I said services too is our installed base. So the first driver is growing the installed base. Installed base has grown nicely over the last several years. We've added 100 million in the last 12 months alone. So that's the first step. Then within that installed base, of course we want to make sure that there are more people that are so interested in our services that in addition to transacting on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those services. And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double-digits. So we want to continue to do that. We want to make it easier for our customers to actually use our services and so we are accepting more and more payment methods around the world. And clearly, as you said the idea of adding new services is very important to us. During the last three years, we've added Apple Pay, which has been incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience. We've added Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely. And we've added a very useful service to our developers. We provide an advertising service for developers in the App Store. The way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our customers in the future. Now we don't want to get into product announcements here, but obviously that is part of our strategy.\nNancy Paxton: Thank you all.

Thank you for your participation."}], "2021": [{"symbol": "AAPL", "quarter": 4, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-10-29 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Apple Inc. Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn things over to Tejas Gala, Senior Analyst, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we\u2019ll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during the discussion today, will consist of our forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company\u2019s business, and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks Tejas. Good afternoon and thanks for joining the call today. Back in April, I said we were in the most challenging environment in which Apple as a company has ever operated. That atmosphere of uncertainty, of resolve, of making difficult calls with limited information has not only come to define Apple\u2019s year, but each of our lives as individuals across this country, and around the world. It has been a chapter that none of us will forget. In the face of these challenges, Apple stayed relentlessly focused on what we do best, seeing in every obstacle an opportunity to do something new, something creative, something better on behalf of our customers. Today we report a quarter and a fiscal year that reflects that effort. This quarter, Apple achieved revenue of $64.7 billion, a September quarter record, despite the anticipated absence of new iPhone availability during the quarter, and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, including closures at many of our retail locations. We also set a new all-time record for Mac and Services. Outside of iPhone, each of our product categories saw strong double digit year-over-year growth, despite supply constraints in several product categories. Our results for this quarter were ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected iPhone and Services performance. As we anticipated, we launched new iPhone models in October, a few weeks later than last year\u2019s mid-September launch. Up to that mid-September point, customer demand for iPhone was very strong, and grew double-digits. On Services, we saw stronger-than-expected performance across the board. Geographically, we set September quarter records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. We also set a September quarter record in India, thanks in part to a very strong reception to this quarter\u2019s launch of our online store in the country. Greater China is the region that was most heavily impacted by the absence of the new iPhones during the September quarter, still we beat our internal expectations in the region, growing non-iPhone revenue strong double digits and iPhone customer demand grew through mid-September. When you pull back the lens to the entire fiscal year, it\u2019s a testament to the team\u2019s work and to the resilience of the business in the era of COVID-19. This year, we set an all-time revenue record of $274.5 billion, growing 6% year-on-year. We grew every quarter, set all-time yearly records in Mac, Wearables Home and Accessories, and Services, and grew by double-digits in every product category outside of iPhone. When we first began to grapple with COVID-19, I said there are worse things for a company whose business is innovation, than having to periodically do just about everything in an entirely new way. This year, we not only launched our most powerful and compelling generation of hardware, software and Services ever, we did it in a way that pushes to reimagine every part of that innovation process, down to how we share these announcements with the world and how we get new products into our customers\u2019 hands. Working from kitchen tables and bedrooms, in distanced office settings and rework labs and manufacturing facilities, the team rebuilt every part of the plane while it was mid-air, and the results speak for themselves. In a year that has been enormously challenging, our retail teams, contact centers, and all those who work with our customers most closely, have gone to creative and dedicated [lengths] [ph] to keep serving our customers. From adapting our stores for contactless pickup to new Apple Express storefronts, to new online customer support options. Amid store closings, reopenings and reimagining, these teams have been an unfailing source of energy, creativity and determination. Innovation isn\u2019t just about what you make; it\u2019s about how you approach problems, and these teams and every team across Apple having not faced a single question this year that they haven\u2019t found an answer to with passion and resolve. Their actions didn\u2019t just meet the moment; they will make us a better company moving forward. The pandemic has hit home for all of us, and at Apple we have seen it as a call to action. We have seen the pain in our communities. Many of us have seen our children work hard to adapt to remote learning, and we all know that the road ahead is uncertain. This quarter and throughout the year, our response to this crisis has been to ask, how can we help? In terms of COVID-19 response, that has meant sourcing and donating millions of face masks, designing and manufacturing millions of face shields, and scaling the production of millions of test kits. But we have tried to live our values more broadly. We\u2019ve pledged $100 million to our new racial equity and justice initiative. We\u2019ve committed to be fully carbon neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and device usage, as massive wildfires, hurricanes and floods, bring home the consequences of climate change for all of us. And we\u2019ve deepened our enduring educational partnerships, from coding education beginning in elementary school, to new efforts with dozens of historically black colleges and universities. One of the many areas where COVID-19 continues to have a significant impact is in education. As teachers, students and parents alike work hard to keep education relevant, creative and effective, our products have helped them meet the moment. In a typical year, the back-to-school season is a bustling time for us. This year, that was true in the biggest way ever. We\u2019ve helped school districts around the world meet this moment in an unprecedented way, including starting nine of our 10 largest school district deployments ever, that alone will support over 1 million students and teachers. We have also supported these deployments and educators and learners everywhere with free tools and training, reaching over 150,000 teachers and millions of parents and students around the world. Looking forward, we feel great optimism about the road in front of us. We\u2019re in the midst of our most prolific product introduction period ever. In addition to the announcement of HomePod Mini, which achieves unmatched sound quality and Siri and smart-home capabilities in a small and affordable format, we just marked the beginning of a new era for iPhone, with the arrival of our first 5G enabled devices. The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini boasts powerful breakthroughs like an edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR display, unprecedented durability with a new ceramic shield, developed with our partners at Corning, new MagSafe charging and accessories, the fastest ever A14 Bionic chip, and a new dual camera system, driven by computational photography. The iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max take all of this to an even higher level, driven by the most powerful photo and video tools ever delivered by a smartphone, including an all new LiDAR scanner and the ability to shoot an Apple ProRAW and full Dolby video. And of course, all of these devices bring the 5G experience users have been waiting for, with lightning fast download and uploads, a new standard in video streaming, more responsive gaming and much more. The early product reviews have been tremendously positive, and our customers have been similarly excited to get their hands on this next era of devices. We\u2019re very optimistic about what the next few weeks will bring. We\u2019re also seeing a very positive response to our September announcement, the all new Apple Watch Series 6, boasts powerful new health and wellness features, including a blood oxygen sensor, a next generation altimeter, and a wide variety of new colors and bands. The potential for Apple Watch\u2019s powerful health and wellness capabilities continues to grow. Just yesterday, the government of Singapore and Apple launched LumiHealth, a first of its kind program designed to encourage healthy activity and behaviors using Apple Watch. Created in collaboration with a team of physicians and public health experts, LumiHealth uses technology and behavioral insights to encourage Singaporeans to keep healthy and complete wellness challenges through their Apple Watch and iPhone. Singapore is a trailblazer here, and we\u2019re proud to be their partner. Our iPad lineup continues to set the pace for the category, including the new iPad Air now shipping with the A14 Bionic, our most powerful chip ever. We announced Apple Fitness Plus, which delivers deep personalization and integration across the fitness tools our users love and depend on. And Apple One, launching tomorrow, is the easiest way for users to enjoy Apple\u2019s services, like Music, TV+, Arcade, iCloud, News+ and Fitness+ on a single plan that is right for them and their family. Looking across services more broadly, we\u2019re really excited about what we see. This was a record quarter for the App Store, AppleCare, Cloud Services, Music and Payment Services. The App Store in particular, continues to play an essential role in helping small businesses, educational institutions and workplaces adapt to COVID-19. Apple TV+ continues to impress, from fan favorites like Ted Lasso, which has won a worldwide audience with its hopeful tone during challenging times, to critical and award praise, including a Primetime Emmy for Billy Crudup in the morning show. Luca will speak in greater detail about our expectations for the December quarter. Without giving away too much, I can tell you that this year has a few more exciting things in store. Before I hand things off, I want to offer one more comment on resilience, because I think if I had to describe our performance this quarter in a single word, it\u2019s resilient. Financial performance aside, I don\u2019t think this year will be a time that any of us look back on with great fondness or nostalgia. Those of us, who wake up every day, hoping for a return to normal, can count ourselves fortunate. Others don\u2019t have that luxury. There is the great pain of a lost loved one, the uncertainty and fear of a lost job, a deep well of concern for people we care about, who we are not able to see. A sense of opportunities missed, of plans delayed, of time lost. Even though we\u2019re apart, it has been obvious this year that around the company, teams and colleagues have been leaning on and counting on each other more than in normal times. I think that instinct, that resilience has been an essential part of how we have navigated this year. Work can\u2019t solve for all the things we\u2019re missing right now, but a shared sense of purpose goes a long way. A belief that we can do more together than we can alone, that people of goodwill, driven by creativity and passion, and that certain itch of a big idea, can still do things that help other people in our own small way to teach, to learn, to create or just to relax at a time like this. Even as the things we make require us to operate at the very cutting edge of technology, in materials, products and ideas that didn\u2019t exist just a few years ago, this year has forced us to face plainly the things that make us human; disease, resilience and hope. You never wished for a year like this one, but I couldn\u2019t be prouder of the team, the work we have done and the small role we have played in helping our communities find hope and resilience in this time. With that, I\u2019ll hand things over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report today a new September quarter revenue record, which caps a remarkable level of performance for our fiscal year 2020, during which we set new all-time records for revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow, in spite of an extremely volatile and challenging macro environment. We could not be more proud of the way our team has innovated and executed, throughout this unprecedented period of uncertainty. We reported total revenue of $64.7 billion for the September quarter, up 1% from a year ago. This is a very impressive level of performance, when we consider that this year; we did not launch and ship any new iPhone models during the quarter. Outside of iPhone, we grew 25% in aggregate, and had strong double-digit year-over-year revenue growth in each of our product categories. We set all-time records for Mac and Services, and a September quarter record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. We also achieved new September quarter records in the vast majority of countries that we track, including among others, The U.S., Canada Brazil, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Russia, India, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Products revenue was $50.1 billion with very strong underlying performance across each product category. Our products outside of iPhone grew a combined 30%, despite supply constraints on iPad, Mac and Apple Watch throughout the quarter. For iPhone, through mid-September, customer demand grew double-digits. As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in aggregate, and in each of our major product categories. Our Services set an all-time record of $14.5 billion, growing 16% year-over-year. We established new all-time records in many Services categories and September quarter records in each geographic segment. I\u2019ll cover this in more detail later. Company gross margin was 38.2%. This was up 20 basis points sequentially, due to cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by a different mix of products. Products\u2019 gross margin was 29.8%, growing 10 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings, partially offset by a different mix. Services gross margin was 66.9% decreasing 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Let me get into more detail for each of our product categories; iPhone revenue was $26.4 billion, as we did not have availability of new iPhone models during the September quarter this year, which we had mentioned during our call in July. While COVID-19 and social distancing measures impacted store operations in a significant manner, demand for iPhone remained very strong. In fact, through mid-September, customer demand for our current product lineup grew double digits, and was well above our expectations. Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the last survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Turning to Services, as I said, we set an all-time revenue record of $14.5 billion. We grew strong double digits and set all-time records in App Store, Cloud Services, Music, Advertising and Payment Services. We also set an all-time record in Apple Care, as in-store traffic improved and we were able to support more customers. Our new services, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Card, are also contributing to overall services growth, and continue to add users, content and features. The key drivers for our Services growth, all continue to be moving in the right direction. First, our installed base continues to grow and is at an all-time high across each major product category. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the September quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. Third, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have over 585 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 135 million from just a year ago. With this momentum, we are very confident to reach and exceed our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. Finally, as Tim mentioned, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings, and are adding new service offerings that we think our customers will love, like Apple One and Apple Fitness+. Wearables, home and accessories established a new September quarter record, with revenue of $7.9 billion, up 21% year-over-year. We set September quarter records in every geographic segment and for each of the three product categories; Wearables, Home and Accessories. As a result, our wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 130 company. Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter, being new to the product. We\u2019re very excited about the future of this category, including the recent launches of our new products; Apple Watch Series 6 NFC, HomePod Mini, and the MagSafe ecosystem of accessories. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about Mac; revenue was by far an all-time record at $9 billion, up 29% over last year and $1.6 billion above our previous record, in spite of supply constraints during the quarter. We grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set all time revenue records in the Americas, and the rest of Asia Pacific, as well as September quarter records in Europe and Japan. We\u2019ve seen amazing customer response to the new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro and very strong demand during the back to school season. IPad performance was also very impressive, with revenue of $6.8 billion, up 46%, and our highest September quarter revenue in eight years despite supply constraints. Demand exceeded our expectations around the world, as we grew very strong double digits in every geographic segment, including an all-time record in Japan and a September quarter record in the Americas. Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments, and we are delighted that the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research, measure customer satisfaction at 93% for Mac and 95% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, it is no surprise that the active installed base for both products reached a new all-time high. In the Enterprise market, our products are helping companies grow their business, while achieving their sustainability goals. One example is Vestas, a leading producer of wind turbines. Vestas is using Apple products and native iOS apps extensively across their operations to deliver renewable energy efficiently to customers worldwide. For instance, they use iPads to help optimize onsite construction operations, cutting crane usage on average by one day per project. Vestas field technicians are using iPhone for work orders, troubleshooting a remote collaboration, saving them 400,000 service hours annually. More recently, they\u2019ve started piloting the augmented reality capability in iPads, to help customers visualize wind turbine installations. We ended the quarter with almost $192 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $5.5 billion of new term debt, and decreased short term borrowing facilities by $6.2 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $112 billion. As a result, net cash was $79 billion at the end of the quarter, as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned nearly $22 billion to shareholders during the September quarter, including $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents, and $18 billion to open market repurchases of 168.7 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 3.1 million shares, in the final settlement of our 16th ASR. Before looking ahead, I want to provide just a few highlights for the amazing fiscal year we just completed. In fiscal \u201920, we grew revenue by 6% to $274.5 billion, a new all-time record. We showed remarkable resilience throughout the year, as we were able to grow both revenue and installed base of active devices in every quarter. During the September quarter, including $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 168.7 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 3.1 million shares in the final settlement of our 16th ASR. Before looking ahead, I want to provide just a few highlights for the amazing fiscal year we just completed. In fiscal 20, we grew revenue by 6% to $274.5 billion and new all-time record. We showed remarkable resilience throughout the year as we were able to grow both revenue and installed base of active devices in every quarter. In spite of the most challenging economic environment we can remember, we said new revenue records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific. We grow our business outside of iPhone by 16%. We grew earnings per share 10% to a new all-time record and most importantly, we continue to deliver innovative products and services that our customers love. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I\u2019d like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to, at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be issuing revenue guidance for the coming quarter. However, we are providing some insights on our expectations for the December quarter for our product categories. These directional comments, assume that COVID related impacts to our business in November and December are similar to what we\u2019re seeing in October. We just started shipping iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, and we\u2019re off to a great start. We are also excited to start preorders on iPhone 12 Mini and 12 Pro Max next Friday. Given the tremendously positive response, we expect iPhone revenue to grow during the December quarter, despite shipping iPhone 12 and 12 Pro four weeks into the quarter, and iPhone 12 Mini and 12 Pro Max seven weeks into the quarter. We expect all other products in aggregate to grow double digits, and we also expect services to continue to grow double digits. For gross margin, we expect it to be similar to our most recent quarters, despite the costs associated with the launch of several new products. For OpEx, we expect to be between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, and the tax rate to be around 16%. Finally today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of common stock, payable November 12, 2020 to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2020. With that, let\u2019s open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask you that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please.\nOperator: Certainly we'll hear first today from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.\nShannonCross: Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit more about China? And in terms of linearity, I think Luca, you'd mentioned that services in all regions were up at an all time high. I'm not sure exactly what your comment was. But, maybe give us a little idea of, whether you're seeing any blowback or benefits in the Huawei situation and just dig a bit more into the trends we're seeing in China, and then have a follow up. Thank you.\nTimCook: Thanks, Shannon. If you look at China, and look at last quarters, I'll talk about both last quarter and this quarter, the last quarter, what we saw was our non iPhone business was up strong double digit for the full quarter. And then if you look at iPhone and you look at it in two parts one, pre mid September, which is pre the point at which the previous year, we would have launched iPhones that period of time which was the bulk of the quarter iPhone was growing from a customer demand point of view. And of course not shipping new iPhones for the last two weeks of September makes that number in the aggregate a negative but the net is the underlying business in China last quarter was very strong and perhaps very different than you might think from just a quick look at the stated number In terms of this quarter, given the explanation for last quarter and the momentum that we've got, and as importantly given the initial data points that we see on iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro, although we don't guide to revenue as Lucas said, I would tell you that we're confident that we will grow this quarter in China. And so we're very bullish on what's going on there. A little more color on last quarter, we had a much more significant inventory draw down on the channel side than other regions. And so that is one reason why the numbers are different than other regions. And additionally, the new products in the year ago quarter were a higher percentage of our iPhone sales than they were in other regions. So hopefully that explains what's going on in China. In terms of the market there, 5G is fairly advanced there. They're forecasting 600,000 base stations by the end of the year. And so we're entering the market at a very good time, and with the reception that we've gotten so far; we're very confident there.\nShannonCross: Okay, great. And then can you talk a bit about just overall in the world, the cadence that you see sort of for the 5G adoption launch, what you see will be sort of the key drivers, obviously, there's a fair amount of subsidies going on in the US at this point. Thank you.\nTimCook: Yes, we're working hard to provide the best experience for iPhone users. To do so we've been collaborating closely with carriers all around the world to ensure iPhone has great throughput and coverage and battery and call quality. We've completed 5G testing so far on over 100 carriers in over 30 regions. And so it's pretty, it's pretty pervasive around the world. But grantedly, it will continue to roll out in more places as carriers continue to expand their coverage. And this will happen every week. And so it's just going to get better. There are obvious places in the world where it's more ahead than others. But we feel like we are entering at a sort of at exactly the right time.\nOperator: That will be from Jeriel Ong from Deutsche Bank.\nJerielOng: Yes, thank you so much. I guess I appreciate the guidance for revenue to grow but I guess my question, perhaps, if I could, is relative to seasonality, you guys over the last five years of seasonality is typically above 50% quarter-on-quarter, do you think that you can beat that, even with the later release? And I have a follow up.\nLucaMaestri: So as I said, Jay, we're not providing a range, for the reasons that I explained during my prepared remarks. So you need to keep in mind a couple of things that are unique about this quarter versus the past. And that I mentioned again, the launch timing of the phones is different from the past. So we are launching the new iPhones, four weeks into the quarter for two models for the 12 and 12 Pro and seven weeks into the quarter for the other two, the iPhone Mini and for 12 Pro Max. So that is something to keep in mind as you think about the growth rates. With regard to all the other product categories, as I said, we are expecting to grow double digits essentially across the board for the rest of our products and for services. And so we are incredibly optimistic about what we've seen so far. Obviously, we started taking pre orders five days ago and it's a bit early for the phone. But we think that there are a lot of tailwinds this year for iPhone for the entire cycle. Some of the comments that Tim has already made, right, we've got the best lineup of iPhones that we've ever had. We got an install base of iPhone that is very large continues to grow. It's an all time high. Obviously, 5G is a once in a decade, opportunity. And as you've seen in some markets, certainly here in the United States, carrier offers are very aggressive. And so that is very good for consumers and ultimately, very good for us. So very, very optimistic, given what we've seen so far.\nJerielOng: Awesome, thank you so much for that context and given us some of the levers to think about. I'd like to ask a little bit more of a strategic one, a little bit longer term in nature. I think one thing is interesting about the Apple one bundle is the desire two bundles in the first place, I guess. I'm wondering, and some investors have asked me this as well, is that why wouldn't you also take that rationale perhaps in hardware, perhaps maybe AirPods and iPhone or AirPods watch and iPhone? Because if it makes sense to bundle services, would it also make sense to bundle hardware? And if that's not the case, then are there benefits of services, bundling that don't necessarily translate to hardware bundling? Thanks.\nTimCook: Yes, we don't have anything to announce today at our hardware bundle but backing up a bit. And we do view that people like to pay for their hardware are at least some substantial portion of it monthly. And so that's the reason that we have implemented installments in our stores and online. And that's the reason you see in some of the channels too selling the hardware on a per month kind of basis. If that begins to look like a subscription, perhaps to some buyers because they're used to holding the phone for a fixed period of time and then turning it over and using the residual value of that phone in a way that gives them a de facto kind of subsidy on a new phone. And so there is something today in the market that works somewhat similar. On the services side; we have -- we had customers coming to us and asking for an easier way to buy all of our services. And we wanted to provide that and we're looking forward to tomorrow to getting Apple one out there.\nOperator: It will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKatyHuberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. New technologies, including the chips that support 5G put upward pressure on cost this year. But you managed to leave ASPS for iPhones relatively unchanged this product cycle. How should we think about the margin profiles of iPhone 12 relative to past iPhone cycles?\nLucaMaestri: Hi, Katy. Obviously, we don't provide any outlook at the gross margin level for product categories. What I said in my prepared remarks, we expect gross margins in total for the company to be pretty much in line with what we've seen during the last quarter. Because obviously, as you said, it's very good, right, because we are offering the new phones at price points that are essentially unchanged. And we are taking on a lot of new technology into the phones. I would say the commodity environment is good. For the first time in many, many quarters, I don't have to say that foreign exchange is a headwind and getting into the quarter is not going to be a factor during the quarter. As we've made it clear in our comments, we are bullish about our sales performance expectation, so we should be getting some leverage. And so I think that the gross margin dynamics are good and it's very good to see that we're able to offer so much more technology and still able to deliver the level of gross margins that I think investors are expecting.\nKatyHuberty: Okay and shifting to the services business. This isn't dependent on certainly any one service but licensing and other historically has been a driver of growth. That's where the ad based revenue comes in. When you think about the Google antitrust pressure, what's the risk that you see some shrinkage in your licensing and others segment within services and do you see opportunities for other services to make up for any potential weakness?\nKatyHuberty: We've got Katy, as you know; we've announced a number of services over the last couple of years. And we are ramping those between Apple TV plus and Apple News plus and Apple Kay, we've got Apple Card. We've got Apple Fitness Plus coming. We've got a number of services that have been launched a bit longer that are doing really well from the app store to iCloud, and So there's a lot of room their input and potential there. I have no idea how the DOJ suit will go, but I think it's a long way from a conclusion on it.\nOperator: That will come from Evercore's Amit Daryanani.\nAmitDaryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two as well. First off, Tim, on iPhones, you talked about the iPhone install data thing being the highest and largest ever been satisfaction rates, obviously pretty high. And our data would suggest replacement cycles are getting elongated. And if I take all of that together, along with the fact that, if iPhone user like me with embarrassingly high weekly usage rate, does that in aggregate give you better confident, better clarity that we could enter an extensive period of iPhone revenue growth versus what we seen the last couple of years.\nTimCook: We're very bullish on this cycle, very bullish on it, because as I sort of step back from it and look at what we've now done, we have for the first time ever, we've launched four iPhones. And there is an iPhone for everyone there. It is the strongest lineup we've ever had by far, we have -- we do have a very large, loyal and growing install base. And we're also reaching out to switchers. And so I'm very optimistic there. We've got a once in a decade opportunity with 5G. There's a lot of excitement around 5G. And we've got some aggressive offers in the marketplace. And so when I think about all of those, I'm really and I look at the initial data points that we've got on the iPhone 12 and the 12 Pro, we are off to a great start.\nAmitDaryanani: Got it. And I guess, Luca had a follow up to you on the services gross margin it just was to kind of continue to move higher rather nicely. Do you think this level at 67% essentially is sustainable? And what do you think are the two or three factors that are enabling these gross margins to remain here as we go forward?\nLucaMaestri: I mean, obviously, we're very pleased with the level of gross margins in services, as you said; they've been expanding almost 300 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The reason for that is, of course that, we are growing the services revenue, and therefore we're getting leverage on a lot of these services, right. Some of it, as explained in the past, we have a portfolio of services that got different margin profiles. And so sometimes, depending on the mix of products we have, we can see margin expansion through mix, as well. And so, but we're also launching new services that where we need to invest heavily up front. And but we think we've been able to show, for example, this year that we've launched a lot of new services, made all the necessary investments and still being able to expand gross margin. So we feel quite confident about that trajectory that we have, that we have for services and we're very, very happy to see the customer response to really all of them, because as we've mentioned earlier, I mean, we've seen revenue records across essentially every category and in across the entire world, right? We've seen September quarter records in every geography around the world. So of the dynamics, all the levers that we have in the services business are working very well right now. And that translates also into margin, of course.\nOperator: We'll hear from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.\nSamikChatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just want to start off with the iPhone lineup here, particularly as you mentioned, the carrier subsidies that you see mixed optimistic about iPhone sales. I think just looking at some other factors here. Earlier in the year, you had mentioned that iPhone sales was seeing an uptake with stimulus checks going out to consumers helping in the consumer spending overall here in the US. So as we see some delays here on that front, are you seeing anything change on the consumer spending side as a macro impacting? How you think about iPhone sales, particularly with -- even with the new product lineup? And I have a follow up. Thank you.\nTimCook: It's prior to mid September, we were seeing double digit growth in customer demand on iPhone. So there's a lot of momentum there. And there is a lot of momentum even much more so now given the launch of the 12 Pro and the iPhone 12. If you're asking whether it could have been even more with a different macro spending environment? I believe the answer to be yes. But you can't run the experiment. And so I don't know for sure. But I suspect that just the COVID in general take something off from a worldwide economic point of view.\nSamikChatterjee: Perfect. And if can just follow up just following up on that COVID discussion. We are potentially here looking at a second wave, right. And I think all companies are trying to prepare for that which you discussed as well in your prepared remarks. But if you can share any kind of thoughts about how you're preparing in relation to either inventory levels, or sourcing from the supply chain, to prepare for any potential disruption, like we had earlier this year?\nTimCook: Well, we're doing everything we can do. But we're prioritizing safety first, obviously. And so with our stores as an example, we've come up with a new concept that puts an essentially turns the store into an express storefront. And we've implemented that in a number of places where we believe that helps from the safety of our employee and the safety of the customer's point of view, but still allows for an interaction to take place. And so we've also put a lot more people on the phones because a lot more people are reaching out to us in that way. And of course, the online store has stayed up and running through the whole of this. I think if you take some of those, the channel is doing some similar things and then some different things as well. And so I think everybody to the best of their ability is putting in contingency plans and finding a way to adapt to the environment. But it is difficult to call and there's a level of uncertainty in it, obviously. And that's what Luca was referring to earlier.\nOperator: That will come from Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company.\nKrishSankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them, first on palooka. I understand you don't want to give color on gross margin by products or segments. But Luca you mentioned growth margin should be similar in December versus September. And so it should grow double digit, there's a general view that on the iPhone side, the bond cost would be headwind for gross margin, but carrier subsidies would be attainment. So I'm kind of curious, how should we think about the different, like gross margin levels into December quarter? And I have a follow up.\nLucaMaestri: Yes. And so typically during the December quarter, we have positive factors because we have the typical seasonal leverage, right, sequentially as we go from September to the holiday season. And we also have an improved mix between products, particularly this year, as we've launched the new iPhone, at the same time, we shouldn't forget that we have launched a lot of new products. During the last several weeks, we launched four new models of iPhone; we launch new models of Apple watch new, models of iPads. And so, clearly every time we launch a new product, the cost structure is higher. And so that is going to be the other side of the coin. So but we think that those two things should balance out and again, as I was saying earlier, and we are accomplishing this while delivering a lot of new technologies, a lot of new features to our customers. This time for an exchange is not a factor and that's something that is a bit different from the past. So but that those are the pluses and minuses.\nKrishSankar: Got it. Definitely helpful, Luca. And then a follow up for Tim. Tim, I kind of surprised you didn't say a lot about the payments ecosystem in this prepared comments kind of curious to find out from your advantage point, how you think of your whole payments ecosystem including Apple Card, Apple Pay, Apple Cash; now you're disaggregating the whole FinTech environment.\nTimCook: Thanks for the question. There's just a limited number of things I can talk about is kind of a reason I didn't talk about it. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the whole Payment Services area. Apple Card is doing well. And Apple Pay is doing exceptionally well. As you can imagine in this environment, people are less want to hand over a card. So this contactless payment has taken on a different level of adoption in it that I think will never go back. The US has been lagging a bit in contactless payment. And I think that the pandemic may well get put the US on a different trajectory there. And so we are very bullish about this area and view that there are there are more things that Apple can do in this space. And in so it's an area of great interest to us.\nOperator: That will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\nKyleMcNealy: Hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about the supply chain. Given your latest start from manufacturing to the flagship phone line of this year, do you think that supply will be able to meet demand through the end of the calendar? Are there any component shortages that you're seeing? Or are there any actions that you can take to increase weekly output versus last year? Thanks.\nTimCook: Yes, Kyle, I don't know what you're talking about iPhone in particular. But if you look at iPhone, we are constrained today. And that's not a surprise where at the front end of the ramp, if you will, and how long we will be supply constrained, it's hard to predict. I mean, we haven't taken orders yet for the iPhone 12 Mini or the Pro Max either. And so those are coming in. So we shall see. But right now we are supply constrained, we are also supply constrained for avoidance of any confusion where supply constrained on Mac, we are supply constrained on iPad. And we're supply constrained on some Apple watches as well. And so we have a fair number of areas right now of focus, and we're working really, really hard to remedy those as quickly as we can. But at this point, I can't estimate when we'll be out of that.\nKyleMcNealy: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And then switching to Mac and iPad. How do you think about the durability of the strength you've seen there with Mac and iPad? Is there any potential for stronger than seasonal pullback after the strong back to school season and holiday season? And these supply constraints make it feel like there's a good chance for continuation of the strong demand trends and in flow through of that. What do we think about the seasonality into December and March quarter being more positive in seasonal or less positive in seasonal? Thanks.\nTimCook: Yes, we placed our thoughts in the color that Luca provided when he said that all products excluding iPhone, all products and services excluding iPhone or all products, rather excluding iPhone would grow in the double digits. And so we continue to be bullish on what Mac and iPad can do. I think the moves that have taken place to remote learning and remote work are not going to go back to normal, normal will become something different. Because I think people are learning that there are aspects of this that work well. And so I don't believe that we're going to go back to where we were. And I think that means that iPads and Macs are even more important in those environments. The growth in both of these last quarter were phenomenal as you can tell from your from datasheet with Mac at 29 and iPad at 46. These are tremendous numbers and as Luca said the September quarter was the all time high for Mac in the history of the company, and by not by little bit by $1.6 billion. And so it was a substantial difference that we did have aggressive promotion for college students that were going back to going back to school. And so that invariably part of it. But I think the other part of it during the remote work thing is not something that's going to snap back to the way it used to be anytime soon.\nOperator: That will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChrisCaso: Yes, thank you. I guess first question is on iPhone pricing. And there was some changes in the iPhone price back this year, the iPhone, the price point for iPhone 12 moves up a bit, I guess the difference the gap between 12 and 12 Pro is smaller. And I guess that's after you made some adjustments years prior where the price point came down a bit? Can you talk through the thought process behind that and the potential implications for either unit out elasticity or blended ASP as a result of the price changes?\nTimCook: Well, I the iPhone 12 family start at $699. In many places, because you can get in the deals that people are really paying are very different than that, because a lot of people, particularly in this country, but also in several other countries in the world connect to a carrier plan. And of course, those offers are much more aggressive. And so the price that our customers paying is probably the most important one. The iPhone 12 is at $799. And so I think what you're saying is there's a $200 difference there. But I would guess that people are viewing it more as a $300 difference between the 12 Mini and the 12 Pro. And so we'll see what the mix turns out. Right now we have no data other than 12 and 12. Pro, we like the data on the 12 Mini and the Pro Max, because we're not taking orders yet. But what we try to always do in pricing is give the customer a great value. And I feel like we really did that this year. And that's despite, as was mentioned earlier, all of the extra features that we placed into the phones, including 5G.\nChrisCaso: As a follow up you mentioned, some of the carrier incentives we've seen here in the US. And if you could provide some more color about that, about what you're seeing now. And obviously, as we went through, years ago, the incentive from carriers were a lot larger. Is this mark some shift in the approach of carriers as we're moving into 5G? What's the extent of the permanence of some of these incentives? And then, as 5G rolls out around the world and into other geographies, is this something we should expect that as either they try to protect from switchers or kind of promote the 5G networks will see a higher prevalence of incentives and carriers as we go forward?\nTimCook: I don't want to speak for our carrier partners that would be up to them to talk about their plans. Generally, I think it's to the vast, vast majority of carriers around the world to their interest to move customers to 5G. And I think it's in the customer's interest to move to 5G and obviously, we like that as well. And so I think you have a situation where everyone's whoring in the same direction. And that's a very different kind of situation than normally we would have. And so it is one of the things as I alluded to earlier that makes me very bullish, only one, the other things are very important to the size of the install base, the product lineup, these things are critically important as well.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Chris.

Thank you all for joining us today."}, {"symbol": "AAPL", "quarter": 3, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-07-30 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone. Welcome to the Apple Incorporated Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn things over to Mr. Tejas Gala, Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed periodic reports Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. Before we begin, I joined the many millions across this country in mourning and memorialize Congressman John Lewis, who was laid to rest earlier today. We've lost a hero who walked among us, a leader in the truest sense who urged this country to aim higher and be better until the very end. I was humbled and fortunate to know him and as an Alabama native his example inspires me still. It now falls to every American to be a living memorial to John Lewis and to carry forward the work and the mission that defined his life. Throughout the call I'll speak in greater detail about Apple's support for equity and justice topics of great urgency on a number of fronts, but first I want to pull the lens back to consider the quarter and full. In an uncertain environment Apple saw a quarter of historic results demonstrating the important role our products play in our customers' lives. We set a June quarter record with revenue of $59.7 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Both products and services set June quarter records and grew double-digits and revenue grew in each of our geographic segments, reflecting the broad base of this success. As always and especially in times of real adversity, what makes us proud as a company is not merely what we did, but how we did it. As millions March for justice in big cities and small towns alike, we committed a $100 million to launch Apple's racial equity and justice initiative as well as new and renewed internal efforts to foster diversity and inclusion at all levels of the company. As COVID-19 continues to represent great risks for individuals and great uncertainty for our communities, care and adaptability are defining how we conduct our work wherever we work. In some places that has met responsibly reopening our operations and retail stores with enhanced health and safety precautions. In others, where the virus has reemerge it's meant taking the challenging, but necessary step of re-closing stores. I'll touch on these topics more in a little bit. But first I want to offer some more context on the quarter's results. Due to the uncertain and ongoing impacts of COVID-19, we did not provide our typical guidance when we reported our results last quarter, but we did provide some color on how we expected the June quarter to play out. I'd like to contextualize our results in terms of that color across each of our product categories beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue grew 2% this quarter. In April, we expected year-over-year performance to worsen, but we saw better-than-expected demand in May and June. We attribute this increase in demand to several interactive causes including a strong iPhone SE launch, continued economic stimulus, and potentially some benefit from shelter in place restrictions lifting around the world. We expected iPad and Mac growth to accelerate and we saw very strong double-digit growth for these devices this quarter. This remarkable performance came in spite of supply constraints on both products. We're working hard to get more iPads and Macs into customers' hands as quickly as possible recognizing how integral they have become to working and learning from home providing entertainment and staying connected with loved ones. Wearables growth decelerated as we expected, but still grew by strong double-digits and set a revenue record for a non-holiday quarter. Building on powerful new features built into watchOS 7 and AirPods Pro announced this quarter, we are very excited about the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. These strong results helped drive our installed base of active devices to new all-time records across each of our product categories. Reflecting the deep integration of hardware, software and services, services generated a June quarter record of $13.2 billion, up 15% year-over-year. As we mentioned during our last call, there were two distinct trends we were seeing and they played out as we thought. First, results for advertising and AppleCare were impacted by the reduced level of economic activity and store closures to a degree that was in line with our expectations. Second, we had strong performance in our digital services with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services as well as elevated engagement on iMessage, Siri and FaceTime. Customers are loving new offerings across Apple services like Apple News today, our new daily audio briefing and Greyhound, our new summer blockbuster starring Tom Hanks. In fact, Apple TV+ just hit a history making 95 awards nominations and 25 wins and accolades. Based on these results and our performance over the last four quarters, we are proud to announce that we have achieved our goal of doubling. Our fiscal 2016 services revenue six months ahead of schedule. We're conscious of the fact that these results stand in stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small and certainly for families. We do not have a zero-sum approach to prosperity and especially in times like this, we are focused on growing the pie, making sure our success isn't just our success and that everything we make, build or do is geared towards creating opportunities for others. The App Store is a great example. This quarter, a new study by independent economists at the Analysis Group founded the App Store facilitated more than 0.5 trillion in commerce globally in 2019 alone. Especially in a time of COVID-19, you can measure economic resilience in the ways in which the App Store supports remote ordering for restaurants, digital commerce for small businesses and an enduring entrepreneurial opportunity for creators and visionaries. Keeping learning vibrant and impactful in the time of COVID-19 is a priority everyone shares. Earlier this month, we announced significant enhancements to the development Swift and Everyone Can Code curricula and we launched a new professional learning course available exclusively to educators. In just two weeks ago, our Community Education initiative added 10 more historically black college and university regional coding centers to our roster, bringing the total to 24 locations nationwide, 12 of which are HBCUs and 21 of which serve majority black and brown student populations. In Apple's backyard, we announced that we are allocating $400 million of our multi-year $2.5 billion affordable housing commitment to new housing construction, homebuyer assistance programs and support for those at greatest risk of experiencing homelessness across Silicon Valley. Apple's results this quarter are only possible due to our people and their ongoing ingenuity, flexibility, resilience and determination during these ever-changing times. I want to thank our AppleCare and retail teams who have paired exceptional service during a time of intense demand with great adaptability during a quarter where stores have reopened in some places and reclosed in others. A dedicated team of specialists and experts has shouldered the task of caring for the well-being of our teams and communities store by store, location by location with evidence driven granularity and agility that is unrivaled anywhere. Innovation from adversity certainly define this year's Worldwide Developers Conference as well. This is an event where traditionally Apple's worldwide community of developers gathers together to share, celebrate and do big things together. Though we could not be together in person, Apple set a new standard for what online events can achieve with our celebrated all virtual event. The results here speak for themselves. More than 22 million viewers tuned in across all of Apple streams. For our developers we distributed more than 72 hours of video content. That's three full days of video. The weak saw more than 200 direct video engineering and design sessions and about 4500 person to person appointments with developers across 227 virtual labs. And of course that's even before you get to this year's announcements from iOS 14, which boasts the radical redesign to the home screen, powerful updates to messages, streamlined and effortless app clips and even greater privacy transparency and controls to major updates to Apple Pencil, Siri and calling and iPad OS 14 to much anticipated sleep tracking, new fitness and wellness features and unprecedented customization and watchOS 7 to the new macOS Big Sur boasting the biggest redesign upgrade to macOS since OS X. No less important for Apple's innovation roadmap is our transition to Apple silicon for the Mac. This two-year effort will achieve both unprecedented performance for the Mac and a common architecture across all Apple products. Looking forward, we are profoundly optimistic about Apple's future and we recognize that with this success comes some real responsibility to lead with our values because those values help make that success possible in the first place. We are just as proud of our announcement this month that Apple will be fully carbon-neutral by 2030 across our entire supply chain and including the energy use of every device we make as we are of any hardware innovation because they spring from the same instinct to leave the world better than we found it. We're committed to standing with those marching for the lives and dignity through our new $100 million commitment to Apple's racial equity and justice initiative, and we're deepening our diversity and inclusion efforts internally because our future as a business is inextricably linked with the future of our communities. There are times when things seem to move slowly when needed progress, economic or social themes bogged down when the instinct to turn away from the horizon and hold onto what you've got fields and ex-capable, and then there are times like this when people of goodwill step forward, when progressed on Moore's itself, when the insistence of hope forces something new. This is an immensely challenging moment. COVID-19 is still devastating many places and we have work left to do to care for the health and well-being of the communities in which all of us live and work. But no community of people, whether a company or a country, can afford to miss this call when it comes. At Apple, we never have and we don't intend to start now. With that, I'll hand things off to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our June quarter was a testament to Apple's ability to innovate and execute during challenging times. Our results speak to the resilience of our business and the relevance of our products and services in our customers' lives. Total revenue was $59.7 billion, a new June quarter record, up 11% from a year ago, despite a 300 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Our performance was strong across our entire portfolio as we grew revenue in each of our product categories and set June quarter records for Mac, for Wearables and for services. Similarly, our results were very strong all around the world with growth in all geographic segments and new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe, in Japan and Rest of Asia-Pacific. Products revenue was $46.5 billion, up 10% and a June quarter record. iPhone returned to growth and we saw very strong double-digit growth from iPad, Mac and Wearables. Lockdowns and point of sale closures were widespread during April and impacted our performance, but we saw demand for all products improve significantly in May and June. As a result of our strong performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories. Our services continue to grow strongly up 15% year-over-year and reached a June quarter record of $13.2 billion. We set all-time records in many services categories and June quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover this in more detail later. Company gross margin was 38%. This was down 40 basis points sequentially due to unfavorable FX of 90 basis points and a different mix of products partially offset by cost savings and services mix. Products gross margin was 29.7% decreasing 60 basis points sequentially due to FX and a different mix partially offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 67.2% up 180 basis points sequentially mainly due to mix. Net income was $11.3 billion and earnings per share were $2.58, up 18% and a June quarter record. Operating cash flow was also a June quarter record at $16.3 billion, an improvement of $4.6 billion over a year ago. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 2% to $26.4 billion with customer demand improving as the quarter progressed. COVID-19 was most impactful during the first three weeks of April when lockdowns and point of sale closures became more widespread in many countries. We saw marked improvement around the world in May and June, which we attribute to an improved level of customer demand helped by the very successful launch of iPhone SE and economic stimulus packages. Our active installed base of iPhones again reached an all-time high as a result of the loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact in the US the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Turning to services, as I said, we set a June quarter record of $13.4 billion of revenue. We had all-time record performance and strong double-digit growth in the App Store, Apple Music, video and cloud services. Our new services Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+ and Apple Card are also contributing to overall services growth and continue to add users\u2019 content and features. At the same time customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow at a fast pace. The number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter with paid accounts increasing double-digits in each of our geographic segments. In aggregate, paid subscriptions grew more than 35 million sequentially and we now have over 550 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 130 million from a year ago. With this momentum we remain confident to reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new June quarter record with revenue of $6.5 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company and we set June quarter records in the majority of markets we track. Importantly Apple Watch continues to extend its reach with over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter new to the product. Next, I'd like to talk about the impressive performance of Mac. Revenue was $7.1 billion, up 22% over last year and a June quarter record. We grew double digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Japan and rest of Asia-Pacific as well as June quarter records in the Americas and Europe. Customer response to our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro launches has been extremely strong. iPad performance was equally impressive with revenue of $6.6 billion, up 31% and our highest June quarter revenue in eight years. Demand was strong around the world with double-digit growth in each of our geographic segments, including a June quarter record in Greater China. The launch of our new iPad Pro has been received incredibly well in every region of the world. Both Mac and iPad are extremely relevant products in the new working and learning environments and the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac and 97% for iPad. Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And as a result, the active installed base for both products reached a new all-time high. Our retail business had record June quarter revenue. Thanks to the performance of our online store which had records in all geographic segments and grew across all major product categories. In June, we launched Apple Card Monthly Installments for more products in our US stores allowing customers to pay for their devices all the time with 0% interest. We're very pleased with the level of customer interest this new offering has generated. In the enterprise market, we continue to see companies leverage Apple products and offerings to successfully navigate their businesses through COVID-19. In healthcare, we are seeing rapid acceleration of telehealth to support a more flexible model of patient care. Many hospitals such as UVA Health, Rush University Medical Center and UC San Diego Health are using apps on iPad and iPhone to have triage, monitor and care for patients who are at home. This helps free up hospital capacity to support patients who need inpatient care while enabling continued care for patients who do not require in-person visits. Since many call center employees are currently working remotely, Apple Business Chat has proven an invaluable tool for staying connected with customers. This quarter HSBC deployed Apple Business Chat in its US and UK contact centers. Apple Business Chat provides a flexible and secured channel for digital banking assistance through a native Apple experience improving the efficiency and experience for both customers and agents. We are seeing similar adoption by hundreds of other organizations. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $8.5 billion of new term debt, retired $7.4 billion of term debt and increased short-term borrowing facilities by $1.1 billion during the quarter leaving us with total debt of $113 billion. As a result, net cash was $81 billion at the end of the quarter and we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned over $21 billion to shareholders during the June quarter, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $10 billion through open market repurchases of 31.3 million Apple shares. We also began a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 15.2 million shares. And finally, we retired an additional 4.8 million shares in the final settlement of our 15th ASR. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Similar to last quarter, given the uncertainty around the world in the near-term, we will not be issuing revenue and margin guidance for the coming quarter. However, we will provide some additional insight on our expectations for the September quarter for our product categories. On iPhone, we expect to see recent performance continue for our current product lineup, including the strong customer response for iPhone SE. In addition, as you know, last year we started selling new iPhones in late September. This year we project supply to be available a few weeks later. We expect the rest of our product categories to have strong year-over-year performance. For services, we expect the September quarter to have the same trends that we have observed during the June quarter except for AppleCare where during the September quarter a year ago we expanded our distribution significantly. As a consequence, we expect a difficult comp for AppleCare also considering the COVID related point of sale closures this year. For gross margin, keep in mind that we will have a different mix than in prior years as I just explained. For OpEx, we expect to be between $9.8 billion and $9.9 billion. We expect the tax rate to be about 16.5% and OI&E to be $50 million. Also today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock payable on August 13, 2020 to shareholders of record as of August 10, 2020. And finally, today we're announcing a four for one split of Apple common stock to make our stock more accessible to a broader base of investors. Each shareholder of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020 will receive three additional shares for every outstanding share held on the record date and trading will begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 31st, 2020. With that let's open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we please have the first question?\nOperator: Yes, that will be from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Tim in light of the economic adversity that you talked about in the prepared remarks, can you just walk us through how Apple is leveraging finance and trade-in programs to make technology more affordable and accessible during this period, while also addressing the opportunity to recycle and reuse products and maybe also extend that to how these programs might expand over time and then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes. As Luca mentioned, in June we actually rolled out to the overwhelming balance of our other products the ability to do interest rate, interest free financing in our stores with payments. And that's in addition to trade-in which is becoming a more common trend now which I think is terrific because it is great for the environment and it acts as a subsidy, if you will, against the price of the new phone. And so when you compound these two things with the financing and the trade-in it makes the product super affordable. And we're really happy with what we're seeing in that regard.\nKaty Huberty: And then, as a follow-up, just specifically to iPhone the category returned to growth. As you pointed out, the installed base is larger today. Our math would suggest that replacement cycles in some cases are elongated. And then you have the affordability element that you just discussed. Does all of that combine to build confidence that we're entering a longer period of iPhone revenue growth after what's been six quarters of decline?\nTim Cook: We're very pleased with how we did on iPhone. It was better than we thought largely because as we pointed out in the prepared remarks May and June were much better. If you look at iPhone in totality the things that get me very optimistic is the size of the active installed base. The fact that if you look in the major geographies like the US, we had the top two selling smartphones. In the UK we had three of the top four. In Australia, we had five of the top six. And in Japan we had the top four. Urban China we were, iPhone 11 was the top selling smartphone in the country. And so these are some very different geographies with their very different competitive situations and we're doing fairly well. The iPhone SE, it's also clear that from the early data we're seeing a higher switcher number than we did in the previous year, which we feel very good about. And it also seems to appeal to some people that were holding onto the device a little longer because they wanted a smaller form factor phone. And so the combination of the smaller form factor and an incredibly affordable price made the iPhone SE very popular. iPhone 11 is still the most popular smartphone, but iPhone SE definitely helped our results. And as we -- as Lucas said in his outlook, we do see that continuing into this quarter currently.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Katy.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.\nTim Cook: Thank you so much.\nTejas Gala: Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes, that would be from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, Tim, when you look at the services business and in terms of your TV+ content production have the movement restrictions impacted the content production efforts? And along the same path four years ago your premonition on services being a $50 billion business in 2020 came sooner than expected, I don't know if you want to make any such forecast four years out and how you think services revenue is going to be. Then I have a follow-up for Luca.\nTim Cook: I'm sorry. I missed that second question because the audio didn't come through. But I think I got the gist of the first. And that is production has been affected for Apple TV+ as I think it has for most people. We are working to get restarted. I don't have a precise date yet when we will get it restarted, but there will be some impact because we shut down in the March time frame and are yet to really restart in a significant way particularly for those that are shut in the LA area given the current status of the virus and those. And I'm sorry I missed your, the second part of your question.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, Tim, I was trying to see, four years ago you made a great prediction that services is going to be $50 billion by 2020. I wanted to see if you have any update to the prediction four years down the road?\nTim Cook: We're not updating today. We feel good. We want to take the moment and feel good about achieving the doubling six months early. And we do have still hanging out there, as you know, the subscription number that we're shooting for later in the year at 600 million. So we do have that objective out there.\nKrish Sankar: If I could just squeeze in one for Luca. With the strong sales in Mac given the shelter-in-place, do you think the back-to-school season got pulled in by a quarter or do you expect the momentum to still continue? Thank you very much.\nLuca Maestri: As I said, when I was talking about providing some commentary for the September quarter, we expect all the non-iPhone product categories to have a very strong year-over-year performance. So we definitely, I mean, the back-to-school season is clearly this one and we are very excited not only for the Mac, but also for the iPad. We've got a fantastic lineup of products and we know that these products are incredibly relevant especially given the current circumstances. So we expect the performance that we've seen for Mac in the June quarter to continue.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes. From Cross Research we'll hear from Shannon Cross.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? I know the revenue was up 2% and I think Luca talked about record iPad, but just curious as to given their 5G [indiscernible] how you're seeing the market play out? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Shannon, the growth that we -- we did see growth in Greater China for the quarter of 2%, currency affected China, a bit more than in other places, it affected 400 basis points. And so in constant currency, we would have grown at 6%. As I had mentioned before, the iPhone 11 has been our best-selling phone and has been number one in urban China and so we're very, very proud of that. iPad was helped in the June quarter there by the work from home and distance learning as it was in other geographies and the Mac also grew strong double digit during the quarter. And services set a new June quarter record there. We also continue to see extremely high new customer rates on Mac and iPad there, to give you a perspective, about three out of four customers that are buying the Mac are new in China and about two out of three that are buying the iPad are new. And so these are numbers that we're super proud of.\nShannon Cross: Great. And then, can you talk a little bit more about the decision to bring Mac Silicon in-house, then the benefits that you expect to see or you've seen from vertical integration of acquisitions like the Intel modem business? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Thanks. Yes, I mean, what we will end up -- what we'll end up with is a common architecture across all of our products, which gives us some interesting things that we can do in products that are -- that is sort of unleashes another round of innovation. And so I don't want to say a lot about it, other than we are extremely excited about it, it's something that we've worked on quite a while to get to this point and we're looking forward to shipping the first Mac with Apple Silicon later in the year.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question please.\nOperator: That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for taking my question guys. I have one and a follow-up as well. Fortunately, I guess, Tim, if I think about the strength, you're seeing with iPhones right now, do you have a sense in terms of where is this trend coming from? Is it more replacement cycles getting shorter or which is getting new customers into the iOS ecosystem because, clearly these growth rates seem fairly impressive in the context of a pandemic and upcoming refresh cycle that we have?\nTim Cook: I think, Amit, it's a combination of a strong launch with iPhone SE and some -- probably some pick up because of the economic stimulus that hit different countries at different points in time. And probably some of the reopening that took place across the quarter, particularly in May and June as Store started to reopen. And so it's a combination of all of those. And as you know, we've been having a strong cycle with the iPhone 11 and the 11 Pro. And so when you combine the -- a strong cycle plus and iPhone SE launch, plus the reopening of the stores, et cetera, I think there were a lot of things that we're going in the right direction there.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect, that's helpful. And then I guess, Luca, if I could just follow up with you. I'd love to get your perspective on how do we think about the overall 38% gross margins? What do you think of the levers to improve this as you go forward, not really September quarter, but over the next one to two years? And in that context, do you see a point where the product gross margin starts to stabilize because they have been trending somewhat lower for the last couple of quarters now.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Well, let me start with what we've seen during the June quarter. We were at 38%, we were down slightly sequentially but up the same amount on a year-over-year basis. And really the big negative impact that we felt for several quarters now has been the strength of the US dollar, so the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was 90 basis points on a year-over-year basis was 130 basis points. So obviously that is something to keep in mind. And then, the other aspect; I think it's always important to keep in mind, Amit, is that we sell many different products. They have different margin profiles. And so sometimes a different mix can have an impact on the aggregate level of products gross margins and we are very pleased to see the performance of Mac, iPad and Wearables but obviously, it's a different mix. Going forward, the variables are always the same, is that the foreign exchange will continue to play an impact, the mix of products there, we're going to be selling, will have an impact as well. The commodities market has been relatively benign and we'll see how that plays out over time. As you know now for several years, we've been managing gross margin, I would say, fairly well in spite of some difficult situations like the one with the strength of the dollar and we plan to continue to make a good trade off decisions between revenue and units and margins.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: It will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\nKyle McNealy: Hi, thanks a lot for the question. Our team in Asia recently, we did some survey work on smartphones in China. It showed that there is still a high proportion of the installed bases on 6, 7, 8 devices. I know you talked about the trade-in programs and promotions that you've been doing there. I wonder if you can tell us whether there is anything else that you're doing to get these customers in your latest technology? What made those customers be looking for and how should we think about when an upgrade cycle might come on more strongly there in China? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Customers upgraded different at a different pace and I don't have in front of me the exact installed base data from China. But much like in other geographies, the upgrades have extended some, it extended some during the depths if you will of the pandemic in China and the rest of the world, and probably to some degree is happening still at this point. The key things that we can do is keep innovating, deliver product that people can't imagine, going through life about. And obviously keep rolling out these programs that makes the front-end purchase be much less, and this is things like the financing in the trade-in programs that you mentioned. And I do feel like those are going quite good in a number of geographies.\nKyle McNealy: Okay, great, thanks. And one more if I may. Congrats again on the strong iPad and Mac results, that's really impressive. I guess the obvious question is, should we ever think about how much of that might be pull-forward and what might be the future upgrades in next few years? Anything else you can share on how you think about growth from here or whether there is a hangover period maybe after the back-to-school season or holiday season. That would be helpful. Thanks.\nTim Cook: The installed base is growing and the new customer numbers that Luca went over in the aggregate are still very high in the close to 50% kind of range. And so, that to me, makes the -- bodes well for the future. There is clearly, as we had indicated, there is some amount of work from home and remote learning that do affect the results of Mac and iPad positively. They probably affect wearables and iPhone, the other direction. And -- but on Mac and iPad, these are productivity tools that people are using to stay engaged with their work or stay engaged with their school work. And we believe we're going to have a strong back to school season. Sitting here today, it certainly looks like that.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Kyle.\nKyle McNealy: Great. Thanks very much.\nTejas Gala: Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Cleveland Research's Ben Bollin.\nBen Bollin: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit about where you think channel inventory is? You talked about the tightness you saw exiting the June quarter for Mac and iPad. Interested, where you think inventory is across major product categories. And then I had a follow-up for Luca.\nTim Cook: We usually -- we've gotten away from talking about channel inventories. But to give you a perspective sitting here looking at it, on iPhone the inventory is slightly less than it was a year ago and that's I'm saying that at a quarter end point, so at the end of Q3. And obviously iPad and Mac are constrained and so both of those are less than they were in the year ago quarter.\nBen Bollin: Okay. And then, Luca, I'm interested, any color you could share about the impact COVID had on OpEx in the quarter, be it work from home, stipends, travel, other employee support costs. And also how the company is thinking about the longer-term opportunity of employees working remotely maybe more permanently many considerations and how that could influence the future OpEx? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Well, on the OpEx front, there are being obviously certain things that have been affected in terms of cost reductions. Obviously, travel, it is a perfect example. The number of meetings that we have internally, some of those costs have been reduced. We've also invested heavily in initiatives for example, we're really trying to help during a very difficult circumstances. For example, we have had a program for example where we match our employee donations, we made donations directly as a company around the world to many institutions and governments. On a net basis, I would say probably the cost have outweighed the savings both during the March and the June quarter, but we think it's absolutely the right thing to do. From an employee perspective, what we said so far is that here in the United States, in most -- the majority of our population will continue to work from home until the end of the year. And then we'll see, I mean, we've taken an approach that we try to understand how the virus is evolving over time. We've taken a very cautious approach of both with our corporate facilities and with our retail stores. I think what you've seen with retail stores is that we have reopened in number of geographies around the world. We've reopened here in the United States. We've had to re-close some of the stores yet here in the United States, as the number of cases has gone up. And we will continue to track how the virus is doing. And hopefully at some point, we're going to get to a point where there is a vaccine or there is a cure. And so we will make those decisions as we get more information.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will be from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank.\nJeriel Ong: Yes, thank you so much. I have two questions as well. I'd like to focus on the gross margin expansion within the services line all-time record for the quarter. I'm just curious whether you think that will sustain, I understand within services is a pretty wide range of gross margins by business, and I'm wondering if that should continue to improve.\nTim Cook: Well, as you've seen, obviously, we've had a sequential expansion in gross margin for services. And that was driven primarily by mix as you said, right. We have a very broad portfolio and depending on which one of the services does better than we have an impact on Services gross margins. We like the Services business because it is -- it's a recurring type of revenue and the margins are accretive to company margin. We did over 67% this quarter, but we want to offer very competitive services across the board and the same -- I think I'm going to make the same comments that I made on products. What matters to us is to be successful with everything that we do and provide great products and services to our customers. So the relative success of our products and services in the marketplace will drive to a certain extent with our margins are, that's the margins are a byproduct of our success in the marketplace.\nJeriel Ong: Got it, really appreciate that. And I wanted to ask question on the Wearables segment. It seems to me that you're categorizing the Wearables business as maybe being a little bit impact from pandemic similar to the iPhones. And it's the first time that Wearables hasn't materially upsided and at least a while in recent memory. I guess the drivers of the Wearables being Watch and predominantly Watch and AirPods. What are your thoughts going forward on whether there is a little bit of pent-up demand perhaps that might resume ads that will get back to a more normalized environment?\nTim Cook: I think on the Watch in particular is like the iPhone more affected by store closures, because people -- some people want to try on the Watch and see what it looks like, look at different band choices and those sorts of things. And so I think as stores closed, it puts more pressure on that. I was -- we did come out sort of the way we told you last quarter, we were going to come out from the color that we gave you. So we knew things would decelerate because of the closures. So we will end up being, we're very pleased with how we did. But the store closures definitely affect the wearables and the iPhone.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Jeriel.\nJeriel Ong: Got it. Really appreciate that.\nTejas Gala: Yes. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. And I have two questions. I'll ask them at the same time and it's one for Tim and one for Luca. Tim, the coronavirus, your company has done a fantastic job at overcoming one of the hurdles. So congratulations to you. As you look forward, say to the Christmas holiday shopping season, and given the economic challenges around the world of virus, coronavirus and your product launches and things like that. Can you give me commentary maybe how this Christmas you're looking forward, to say, maybe some past cycles of Christmas? Because it just seems like it's a little bit different, but Apple is really showing a lot more strength coming into this Christmas than may be some of the past years. And then for Luca, I think you made a quick comment, Luca, that you mentioned something about a few weeks later, was Apple like iPhone, iPhone chips or product launches or maybe expand upon that. I know things are more difficult, but I didn't quite keep the commentary, it was in your prepared comments, we'll go about a few weeks late that let's just have a quick little blood. Thank you so much, gentlemen.\nTim Cook: Yes, we take it one quarter at a time. And so, we'll give you color on the December quarter and October. Generally speaking, I think we need to see a vaccine or therapeutic or both. And there is some optimism around that and in that particular timeframe. And so, we'll see, I don't have any information that is publicly available there. But I think that would boost consumer confidence quite a bit if it begins to happen and I think that any kind of consumer style company would benefit from that.\nLuca Maestri: And Jim, on the iPhone, I said in my remarks that we launched a year ago, we launched the new iPhone in late September. So I was referring to the new product. And I said that this year, the supply of the new product will be a few weeks later than that.\nJim Suva: Great. Congratulations to you and your entire organization and teams. Thank you so much.\nTim Cook: Thanks so much.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you can maybe comment on the penetration of Apple Card users in the iOS installed base? And have you seen any change in the buying behavior of Apple Card users in terms of accelerating spend on more Apple products and services? Then I have a follow-on.\nTim Cook: We saw changes in consumer spending as the shutdowns occurred and the store closures occurred, we could see that across the Card. It affected the categories that you would guess the most like travel and entertainment et cetera. But overall if you sort of pull the lens out on the Apple Card, we're very happy with the number of people that have Apple Card. We believe based on what we've heard that it's the fastest rollout in the history of credit cards and so we feel very good about that.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim. And as a follow-up, now that Apple has Apple Silicon for Macs. Would you ever consider monetizing this as a merchant silicon vendor or is this going to be forever for Apple use?\nTim Cook: Well, I don't want to make a forever comment, but there are -- we are a product company and we love making the whole thing. And because if we can -- on the user experience in that way and with the goal of delighting the user. And that's the reason that we're doing the Apple Silicon is because we can envision some products that we can achieve with Apple Silicon that we couldn't achieve otherwise. And so that's how we look at it.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks, Tim.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Wamsi.

Welcome to the Apple Incorporated Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Tejas Gala, Senior Manager, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, and he will be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we\u2019ll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including without limitation those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Actual results or trends could differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speaks as of their respective dates. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I hope you\u2019re staying safe and well. Today Apple reports $58.3 billion in revenue, an all-time record for Services, and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home and Accessories. It was also a quarterly revenue record for Apple Retail powered by phenomenal growth in our online store. Amid the most challenging global environment in which we\u2019ve ever operated our business, we\u2019re proud to say that Apple grew during the quarter. But before we dive more deeply into the numbers, I want to speak just for a bit on COVID-19. This is something Apple has been contending with since January. And I think that how we have responded, what we have been inspired to do, tells an important story about Apple\u2019s great durability as a business, and the enduring importance of our products in our customers\u2019 lives. It also speaks to Apple\u2019s unmatched capacity to be creative, to think always in terms of the long term and to forge ahead when others may feel an instinct to pull back. Before COVID-19 was on the horizon, we anticipated that Q2 was going to be a prolific and energetic period for Apple. And when the pandemic did strike, our teams not only succeeded in growing the business in introducing powerful new products, and in meeting our customers\u2019 needs, but they also rose to the occasion in terms of meeting our broader obligations to the communities in which we live and work. Let\u2019s look quickly across the business. At the same time that they were leaving no stone unturned to get our latest generation of devices manufactured and into our customers\u2019 hands, our worldwide network of supply chain partners, logistics and operations folks in every part of the Company were also sourcing more than 30 million masks for frontline medical workers, ensuring they\u2019re donated to places of greatest need in every region around the world. While our product teams were preparing to launch a new iPad Pro, Magic Keyboard, MacBook Air and the new iPhone SE, all of which have been very well received by reviewers and consumers alike, they were also working with our suppliers to design, test, manufacture and distribute more than 7.5 million face shields, and we continue to ship more than 1 million of these every week to the doctors, nurses and medical personnel on the frontlines. In a quarter where our Services teams achieved strong growth, which Luca will dig into in a minute, and which speaks to the real durability of our Services strategy, these teams were also putting COVID-19 front and center. As Apple News, reached 125 million monthly active users, we elevated trusted information from reliable sources through a special COVID-19 vertical. We let customers skip payments without incurring interest on Apple Card for March and April in light of financial hardship for many families. We worked with everyone from Oprah to Lady Gaga to inform, entertain and give back through Apple TV and services like FaceTime and Messages set new all-time records for daily volume during this quarter as users relied on their devices to stay connected in a new reality. In software, at the same time that our teams worked with great creativity and excitement as we prepare to deliver our first ever all online Worldwide Developers Conference later this quarter, they also worked with the same creativity and speed to put together our COVID-19 symptom checking website and app in partnership with the CDC. As of today, the app has been installed nearly 2 million times and the web tool has received over 3 million unique visits. And just this month, to accelerate contact tracing, we are launching a joint effort with Google to enable the use of Bluetooth technology to help governments and health agencies reduce the spread of the virus with user privacy and security central to the design. We paired these programmatic efforts with a broader strategy to get back where it\u2019s needed most. We\u2019ve made major corporate donations to response efforts around the world to support global citizens as well as a new fund for Americans experiencing food insecurity as a result of the crisis. When you tally these things up and consider our ongoing 2 to 1 match for employee donations, Apple\u2019s contributions to the global response are significant, diverse, and a great source of pride for the whole chain. We\u2019re also doing what we can to help our employees, their families, and by extension their communities stay safe and well by modifying our operations where appropriate. This extends of course to our retail employees, they are Apple\u2019s face to our customers and an instrumental part of our business and we\u2019re compensating them normally despite store closures. During a quarter where circumstances evolve by the hour, we have been gratified by the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain. While we felt some temporary supply constraints in February, our operations team, suppliers and manufacturing partners have been safely returning to work and production was back at typical levels toward the end of March. At this time of social distance, of shuttered school and gathering places, of delayed plans and new ways of socializing, we have seen significant evidence that our products have taken a renewed importance for customers. Teachers and students around the world are relying on our technology to teach, learn, and stay connected with each other. We are in the process of deploying major orders of iPads to school systems working to keep learning going strong at a distance, including tens of thousands in Ontario, Canada; Glasgow, Scotland and Puerto Rico, a 100,000 to the city of Los Angeles and 350,000 to New York City, our largest educational iPad deployment ever. Since early March, we\u2019ve seen unprecedented demand for a pro app from students, enthusiasts and creative professionals. These folks are keeping us all entertained and inspired as we stay at home. And to help them do it, we made Final Cut Pro X and Logic Pro X available for free for 90-days for everyone. And the reaction has been overwhelming, driving software downloads and usage to record levels. And doctors and medical professionals are making even greater use of Apple Watch and other health features to communicate with patients and to treat them safely from a distance when necessary. With new FDA guidance on non-invasive remote patient monitoring, for example, the ECG app on Apple Watch is increasingly being used to facilitate remote ECG measurements and recordings for telemedicine usage, reducing patient and healthcare provider contact and exposure. Many hospitals such as Geisinger Health System, NYU Langone Health, and Stanford Health Care are using apps on iPad and iPhone to support communication and video conferences between hospitalized patients and their care teams. This enables the care teams to keep a close watch on patients without entering isolation rooms, which helps to minimize exposure and reduces some of the need for personal protective equipment. Now, when you step back and tally all this up, when you consider all the ways COVID-19 has touched Apple, our customers and the way we work, this may not have been the quarter it could have been absent this pandemic, but I don't think I can recall a quarter where I've been prouder of what we do or how we do it. As I said at the outset, we achieved revenue of $58.3 billion and underneath that was product revenue of $45 billion. The performance of our product business had three very different phases during the March quarter. Based on Apple\u2019s performance during the first five weeks of the quarter, we were confident we were headed toward a record second quarter at the very high end of our expectations. In the next five weeks of the quarter, as COVID-19 started impacting China, iPhone supply was temporarily affected, as well as demand for our products within China. This caused us to withdraw our revenue guidance in February. At that point, demand for our products outside of China was still strong and in line with our expectations. During the last three weeks of the quarter, as the virus spread globally and social distancing measures were put in place worldwide, including the closure of all our retail stores outside of Greater China on March 13th, and many channel partner points of sales around the world, we saw downward pressure on demand, particularly for iPhone and Wearables. Given the lack of visibility and uncertainly in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. Over the long term though, we have a high degree of confidence in the enduring strength of our business. Our global supply chain is profoundly durable and resilient. We have shown the consistent ability to meet and manage temporary supply challenges like those caused by COVID-19. We have continued to deliver innovative new products across multiple categories that appeal to a broad cross-section of customers, including the all-new iPhone SE, which achieved unmatched technological capacity at an incredible value. Our teams worldwide have tackled the complexities of this moment with unmatched creativity, good humor and dedication to our customers. For a company whose business is innovation, there are real upsides in periodically having to figure out how to do just about everything in a brand new way. Our long-running investment in our Services strategy is succeeding. This business is growing and is a reflection of our enduring large and growing installed base. We expect to meet our longstanding goal of doubling our fiscal 2016 Services revenue in 2020. We have always run Apple for the long term. We entered this period with unmatched financial strain, a robust cash position and our best product pipeline ever. Major investments, including our five-year commitment to contribute $350 billion to the economy here in the United States are moving forward full speed ahead. It\u2019s in these moments that we set ourselves apart. We\u2019ve always managed through difficult moments by doubling down and investing in the next generation of innovation. And that\u2019s our strategy today. And so, while we can\u2019t say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. Apple will continue to do everything we can do to help the global response and to keep our customers learning, creating, sharing, and connecting so that life can remain as normal as it can during this challenging time. With that, I\u2019ll hand things off to Luca. \nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. It has been a very different quarter than we were expecting when we last talked to you at the end of January. But, we could not be more proud of our Apple teams around the world, our role in supporting local communities and our partners throughout the value chain, and how resilient our business and financial performance has been during these challenging times.  So, the revenue for the quarter was $58.3 billion, up 1% from a year ago, despite the extreme circumstances from the impact of COVID-19 and a headwind of a 100 basis points from foreign exchange. Products revenue was $45 billion, down 3%. After a very strong January, our performance was impacted particularly during the last three weeks of the quarter when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures increase due to COVID-19 spreading around the world and affected our product sales. However, on a demand basis, our performance was stronger than our reported results as we reduced iPhone channel inventory more than we did a year ago. Importantly, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high in all of our geographic segments and all major product categories. Services revenue followed a different trend with very strong year-over-year growth of 17%. We set a new all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion with all-time records in many of our Services categories and in most countries we track. I\u2019ll provide more details on this later. Company gross margin was 38.4%, flat sequentially with cost savings and mix shift towards Services offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 30.3%, decreasing 380 basis points sequentially due to loss of leverage and unfavorable mix. This drop was more pronounced than under normal circumstances due to the COVID-19 impact I mentioned earlier. Services gross margin was 65.4%, up 100 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.4%. This was lower than our 16.5% guidance due to onetime discreet items. Net income was $11.2 billion and earnings per share with $2.55, up 4%. Operating cash flow was very strong at $13.3 billion, an improvement of $2.2 billion over a year ago. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $29 billion, declined 7% year-over-year as both iPhone supply and demand were affected by the impact of COVID-19 at some point during the quarter. On the supply side, we suffered from some temporary supply shortages during February, but we\u2019ve been extremely pleased with the resilience and adaptability of our global supply chain, as well as its ability to get people back to work safely when circumstances allow. Our operations team and manufacturing partners put forth an extraordinary effort to restore production quickly, and we exited the quarter in a good supply position for most of our product lines. On the demand side, after very strong first five weeks, we saw the impact of COVID-19 affect demand in China for the next five weeks, and then more broadly around the world for the last three weeks of the quarter, when lockdowns and point-of-sale closures became more widespread in many countries. While we did see a slight elongation in our replacement cycle towards the end of the quarter, which we attribute to the widespread point-of-sale closures, our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high. This speaks to the quality of our products and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Turning to Services. We set an all-time revenue record of $13.3 billion with strong performance across the board with all-time revenue records in the App Store, Apple Music, Video, cloud services, and our App Store search ad business. And we also set a March quarter record for AppleCare. Our new services, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus and Apple Card continue to add users, content and features while contributing to overall Services growth. As Tim mentioned, we\u2019re well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal \u201816 Services revenue during 2020. App Store revenue grew by strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased over 30% year-over-year, reaching a new all-time high. Our first party subscription services also continued to perform very well. Apple Music and cloud services, both set all-time revenue record and AppleCare set a March quarter record. Paid subscriptions for all three of these services were up strong double-digits. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow strongly, and the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter. In particular, the number of paid accounts increased double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 515 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 125 million from a year ago. On a sequential basis, paid subscriptions grew by over 35 million. This is the highest sequential growth we have ever experienced. With this momentum, we\u2019re confident we will reach our increased target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. Wearables, Home and Accessories established a new March quarter record with revenue of $6.3 billion, up 23% year-over-year with strong double digit performance across all five geographic segments. Our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 140 company, and we\u2019re very excited by the many opportunities in front of us for this product category. For example, Apple Watch continues to expand its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch around the world during the quarter were new to the product. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $5.4 billion; iPad revenue was $4.4 billion. Towards the end of the quarter, we launched a brand new iPad Pro that includes a first in class LiDAR scanner with some really exciting augmented reality applications; and MacBook Air with significantly improved performance at a lower price. We\u2019re very pleased with the strong customer interest for both products. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter were new to that product and the active installed base for both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. And the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 95% for iPad and 96% for Mac. In the enterprise market businesses everywhere have been making the transition to working remotely. We\u2019ve created content to assist our customers in this transition including an on-demand video learning series focused on topics like remote deployments of iPad and Mac and security. We\u2019ve also realigned our own retail business and enterprise teams to provide timely and relevant support to customers as they navigate new work environments. Some of our largest customers offering Mac to employees such as IBM and SAP have been able to pivot quickly to allow employees to easily set up and secure their devices from home, benefiting from Apple Business Manager and zero-touch deployment. And we\u2019ve seen countless examples of new projects of remote deployments implemented in just a few hours. Peloton for instance, worked with our New York teams to deploy an entire fleet of Macs overnight, so their team could work remotely. In essential sectors, such as grocery and financial services, we\u2019ve seen organizations adopt our technology to better serve their customers safely. Leading grocers around the world, like Trader Joe\u2019s, Woolworths, Lawson\u2019s, Sainsbury\u2019s, Lidl, and Carrefour offer Apple Pay so customers can use contactless payments. And as stores shift to become fulfillment centers for online orders, organizations are leveraging apps for remote shoppers and food delivery to reduce foot traffic. In banking, where safety and securities are a top priority, one way to protect company and client information is by providing corporate iOS devices to employees who use mobile phones daily as part of their jobs. As an example, Bank of America is purchasing tens of thousands of additional iOS devices for their workforce. Let me now turn to our cash position. First, I want to note that liquidity has not been an issue for us during these highly unusual financial market conditions. We have an extraordinarily strong balance sheet, very deep access to capital markets, and unmatched free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash plus marketable securities, total debt of $110 billion. And as a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned $22 billion to shareholders during the March quarter, including $18.5 billion through open market repurchases of 64.7 million Apple shares, and $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents. Finally, as we move ahead into the June quarter, I\u2019d like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. As Tim mentioned, given the lack of visibility and certainty in the near term, we will not be issuing guidance for the coming quarter. However, based on what we have seen in April, and how we think things might play out, I would like to provide some additional insight on headwinds and tailwinds we\u2019re facing. From a foreign exchange standpoint, the U.S. dollar has appreciated recently against most currencies around the world. And as a result, we expect our revenue to be negatively impacted by more than $1.5 billion on a year-over-year basis. Our global supply chain is back, up and running. We are in a typical supply position, including our usual ramp associated with new products recently launched. These newly launched products, iPad Pro, MacBook Air, and iPhone SE have all received outstanding customer response, even during these extreme circumstances. On iPhone and Wearables, we expect a year-over-year revenue performance to worsen in the June quarter relative to the March quarter; on iPad and Mac, we expect the year-over-year revenue performance to improve in the June quarter. On Services, we are seeing two distinct trends. First, customers are actively engaging with our ecosystem and digital services, and we believe the very strong recent performance in the App Store, Video, Music, and cloud services will continue throughout the June quarter. Second, due to the overall reduced level of economic activity, due to the lockdowns around the world, services like AppleCare and advertising are being impacted. AppleCare is comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements with our customers, both of which have been obviously affected by store closures and reduced level of customer traffic. Advertising, which is comprised of third-party agreements, our App Store search ads, and Apple News ads has been impacted by overall economic weakness and uncertainty on when businesses will reopen. For gross margin, sequential headwinds include foreign exchange, the mix within products, and the seasonal loss of leverage on our product business. Foreign exchange will have a 70 basis points impact sequentially and 130 basis points impact year-over-year. Regarding product mix, keep in mind the commentary we provided at the revenue level. Sequential tailwinds include cost savings and the mix shift towards services. With regard to capital allocation, our approach remains unchanged. We continue to invest confidently in our future while also returning value to our shareholders. We are in the midst of developing our most exciting pipeline of products and services ever while contributing over $350 billion to the U.S. economy and expanding our footprint in many cities around the country over a five-year period. We also continue to believe that there is great value in our stock, and we are maintaining our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As a testament to the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized $50 billion for share repurchases in addition to the over $40 billion authorization remaining under the current share repurchase plan. Our Board has also authorized a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend and today declared a cash dividend of $0.82 per share of common stock, payable on May 14, 2020, to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2020. Finally, and most importantly, we are managing Apple for the long term, as we\u2019ve always done. During uncertain times historically, we have continued to invest in the business and this remains our philosophy. We will continue to stay focused on what we do best, investing in our product and service pipeline, managing the business wisely, and taking care of our teams and believe we will come out from this stronger. With that, let\u2019s open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may have the first question, please?\nOperator: Yes. That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question, and I hope everyone is well. Tim, you talked about seeing some improvement in the second half of April. So, I was wondering if you could just talk maybe a bit more on the segment, a geographic basis, what you\u2019re seeing and in the various regions that you\u2019re selling in and what you\u2019re hearing from your customers. And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Sure, Shannon. If you look at -- I\u2019ll start with China. If you look at what happened in China, we were having a really good January. The lockdown started there toward the end of January, as you know. February, we saw a steep decline in demand. We closed our stores in February. As the lockdown completed in mid-February, toward the second half of February, we begin to open stores. We opened on a staggered basis that took about 30 days until mid-March. And from a demand point of view, we saw then an improvement in March over February. And if you look at, kind of where we are today, we\u2019ve seen further improvement in April as compared to March. And so, that\u2019s China. If you look at the rest of the world, we were doing great in January, the first five weeks of the quarter. And we do believe that we were headed toward the sort of the top end of our expectations that we had talked to you about on the last call. The next five weeks were spent sort of reacting and getting the supply chain back up in full force and working through the sharp decline in China that I already talked about. The real thing for the rest of the world happened in March when the shelter-in-place orders went in and the work-from-home began. For those two, three weeks period, at the end of the quarter, we saw a sharp decline in demand. If you now step out into April and look at that, early April started like the end of March, but in the second half of April, we\u2019ve seen an uptick across really across the board. It\u2019s not just related to a certain geo or a certain product. We think, by looking at it, a part of it is due to just our new products, a part of it is due to the stimulus programs taking effect in April, and then a part of it is probably the consumer behavior of knowing this is going to go on for a little while longer and getting some devices and so forth lined up to work at home more. In particular for as I think Luca shared, we believe that iPad and Mac are going to improve on a year-over-year basis during this quarter, and that\u2019s customers that are either taking online education or working remotely. So, complex answer to your question, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. That was helpful. Luca, unless I missed it, you talked about various puts and takes in the quarter, but didn\u2019t really discuss operating expenses. I know you mentioned some cost savings on the COGS line. I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about your spending and OpEx, given some of the macro challenges that you may be facing. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So, Shannon, as we said, we manage the Company for the long term, right? So, we know that the core of the business, the core of the Company is innovation and product and services development. So, we will continue to invest in our pipeline. We\u2019re very excited about what we have in store. And so, we will continue to invest there. Obviously, we are aware of the environment and so, we will manage the SG&A portion of the company tightly. We are making new investments in the new services that we launched recently. As you know, we purchased the baseband activities from Intel. And obviously, we want to develop that technology because we consider it\u2019s a core technology for us. And so, we will try to balance the need to continue to invest during difficult circumstances and the fact that we like to manage the business wisely.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will be from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim, I think I speak for everyone on the call that we\u2019re all very appreciative of Apple\u2019s contribution during this pandemic. We all appreciate it.\nTim Cook: Thank you very much for that.\nWamsi Mohan: Tim, in past downturns, we have not really seen Apple pull back from investing. And you as a company have largely maintained the product introduction cadence. But given these are unprecedented times and there are a lot of challenges associated with product development, during a time when you have a global footprint for such activities and unable to really do a lot of things in person, how should we think about the product development and introduction cadence as we go over the next several quarters? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Well, we\u2019re continuing to operate. And so, as you can tell, along with everything else going on, we were able to launch and ship the iPhone SE, the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard, and the MacBook Air. And so, the business continues and the new products are our lifeblood. And so, we\u2019re continuing to work. Everybody\u2019s getting used to the work-at-home. In some areas of the Company, people maybe even more productive, in some other areas they\u2019re not as productive. And so, it\u2019s mixed, depending upon what the roles are. But, as you can tell from what we did this quarter, despite the environment, we have our head down, are working because we know that our customers want the products that we\u2019ve got. They\u2019re even more important in these times.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you, Tim. As a follow-up, I know you\u2019re doing a lot with both the Apple Card and financing plan for iPhones to get your products in the hands of customers. But, I was wondering, would you consider using the strength of your balance sheet maybe a little differently, structure maybe deferred payments or things like that, or do you think that there could be other steps like bundling that you will consider versus what you already currently do? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Well, as you know, we launched the payment plan earlier on Apple Card for iPhone. We\u2019re working on doing that for other products as well. And you\u2019ll see something on that shortly. So, we\u2019re very-focused on the affordability point. The trade-in programs also are fairly wide across the board and act as both something great for the environment, also something great from a way to get that entry price down. In terms of deferred payments, nothing to announce today. But, as you know, having access to the card, at least in the United States, gives us more degrees of freedom. And that is not using our balance sheet. But, we play a key role in deciding what kind of programs go with the card.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please? \nOperator: That will come from Morgan Stanley\u2019s Katy Huberty.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you for the question. I hope the whole team is staying healthy and safe. Tim, I want to start on a longer term question. Where do you see structural changes on the back of this health crisis that might present opportunities for new revenue streams at Apple? And I\u2019m particularly thinking about your past comments on health and augmented reality. But I\u2019m sure there is even more areas of inspiration and creativity coming out of the company. And then, I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: I think, there are things from just a great reminder of how important our products are for remote work. And it\u2019s pretty clear to me that where things will get a lot closer to normal than they are today, obviously. I think many people are finding that they can learn remotely. And so, I suspect that trend will accelerate some. I think that\u2019s probably also true about working remotely in some areas and in some jobs. And so, I think we have significant solutions and products for all of those groups. On the health area, I gave some examples in my opening comments about the ECG being used on the Watch. You can bet that we\u2019re looking at other areas in this. We were already doing that because we viewed that that area was a huge opportunity for the Company and a way for us to help a lot of people. And so, you will see us continue on that. I wouldn\u2019t say that the health door opened wider. I would say, it was already opened fairly wide.\nKaty Huberty: Okay. And then, as a follow-up, the $50 billion share repurchase authorization is impressive in absolute terms, but it is a bit lower than the last couple of years. So, just any context around the thought process of landing on $50 billion. And then, related to that, you have one of the strongest balance sheets in the world. Does the current environment change your thinking at all around M&A opportunities?\nLuca Maestri: Let me answer that, Katy. First of all, on the buyback. As I said, in general, our approach to capital allocation has remained the same for the last several years and it\u2019s not changing now. Keep in mind here, we\u2019re talking about just the authorization, right? And when you look at our actual results at the end of every quarter, you see how much we actually do in terms of share repurchases. The $50 billion is in addition to over $40 billion that is still remaining from the past authorization that we\u2019ve received from our Board, right? So it\u2019s the total available or outstanding in terms of authorization is over $90. And as you look at our run rate during the last several years, you know that that is a very adequate amount. And as you know, we will provide an additional update a year from now. So, nothing really has changed there. And nothing has changed on our approach for M&A. We\u2019ve been quite active over the last several years. We purchase companies on a very regular basis. We\u2019re always looking for ways to accelerate our product roadmaps or fill gaps in our portfolio, both on the hardware side, on the software side, on the services side. So, we will continue to do that. And so, also on the M&A front, nothing has changed.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off on the channel inventory. I was hoping if you could talk about how did channel inventory look like in the March quarter, because it sounds like it may be below the historical ranges. And then, the discussion you had for June quarter performance of iPhones, what are you embedding from a channel building back inventory levels in that expectation.\nTim Cook: Amit, it\u2019s Tim. If you look at the iPhone channel inventory during Q2, the reduction of it was more than the reduction from the previous year. It\u2019s not unusual that we reduce in Q2. In fact, if you look back, generally speaking, in the first half of the calendar year, we reduce channel inventories; during the second half of the calendar year, we generally raise channel inventories. That\u2019s a seasonal thing. And sitting here today, I believe that will happen this year as well. So, hopefully, that answers your question. And by the way, we ended in a comfortable position. You could conclude from that that we were within a target range.\nAmit Daryanani: That\u2019s really helpful. Maybe just for follow-up. Tim, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit about, how do you think about Apple\u2019s manufacturing strategy and perhaps need for some diversity, especially given everything in the Company and everyone has gone through over the last 12 months, how do you think about that? And do you feel comfortable that the supply chain and the manufacturing base is well situated today to launch the traditional fall products that they used to get from Apple?\nTim Cook: As you know, our supply chain is global. And so, our products are truly made everywhere. And I would focus on that versus focus on one element of the manufacturing process, which tends to get more visibility, which is the final assembly. We have some final assembly in the United States; we have final assembly in China as well. I think, you\u2019d have to conclude, or at least I conclude that if you look at the shock to the supply chain that took place this quarter, for it to come back up so quickly really demonstrates that it\u2019s durable and resilient. And so, I feel good about where we are. That said, we\u2019re always looking at tweaks. And it\u2019s just not something we talk about, because if we view it as confidential and competitive information. And so, we will look at the -- as we get out of this totally, we will look to see what we learned and what we should change.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank\nJeriel Ong: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. So, I want to focus my question on Services. The segment was solid in the quarter despite overall macro weakness. I can kind of see the logic behind it being strong despite product weakness overall. As you kind of look at the rest of the year, do you think that sustains or at some point does the macro impacts worldwide impact the Services line?\nLuca Maestri: Jeriel, let me take that one. We typically don\u2019t give a lot of specifics about our categories. But I\u2019ve said, as we look into the June quarter, we see two distinct trends in our services business overall. Our ecosystem is very strong. Our customers are very engaged. We are continuing to grow double digits, the number of transacting accounts and paid accounts. And so, we expect our digital services to continue at the same level of performance that we have seen during the March quarter. And that includes the App Store, of course, our video business, our music business, cloud services. So, we expect all these businesses to continue to grow very strongly. Given the overall economic environment, the level of demand right now, there are two businesses that we believe are going to be impacted during the June quarter. One of them is AppleCare. AppleCare is essentially comprised of our product repair business and the warranty agreements that we signed with our customers when they purchase our devices. Both these businesses have been affected obviously by the store closures. And not only our retail stores, but also our partners points of sale, and obviously, the reduced level of customer traffic because of the social distancing measures. Right? And we do expect AppleCare to be affected during the during the June quarter. The other business, which we think is going to be impacted by the overall economic weakness and the uncertainty on when businesses will reopen is advertising, which is the sum of our advertising business on the App Store, on Apple News, and the third party agreements that we have on the advertising front. So, these are two things that during the June quarter will create a headwind for the Services business.\nJeriel Ong: Got it. I appreciate that. My second question is about the overall purchasing decisions the consumers are making. So far, through April, have you seen increased perhaps downtick across your product line? So for example, somebody might have shift maybe toward the lower end of the storage mix of certain products. And do you expect that going forward, as unemployment uptick and macro impacts kind of layer on through the rest of \u201820? Thanks.\nTim Cook: I haven\u2019t seen what you\u2019re asking. No. I have seen a strong customer response to iPhone SE, which is our most affordable iPhone. But it appears that those customers are primarily coming from wanting a smaller form factor with the latest technology, or coming over from it from Android. So, those are the two principal kind of segments versus somebody buying down, as you\u2019re talking about it. We\u2019ve also seen -- we launched the iPad Pro in the midst of all of this and the reception there has also been incredibly good. And that\u2019s obviously our top of the line iPad. And so, I\u2019m not seeing what you\u2019re alluding to, at least at this point.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Jeriel. Can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: That will be from JP Morgan\u2019s Samik Chatterjee.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. If I can just start with a question on kind of what you\u2019re seeing in China. You mentioned going to the pickup in activity. But, is that driven by more kind of footfall in the stores, or what\u2019ve you seen relative to online activity, and how much of this recovery is being driven online? Any thoughts on that, please?\nTim Cook: Yes. What we saw in China for the full quarter -- and I\u2019ll speak about mainland China because I think that\u2019s the source of your question. We saw strong results in iPad and in Wearables, and in Services. And if you look up underneath the full quarter, we saw a strong January, and then a significantly reduced demand in February as the shelter-in-place orders and the lockdowns went into effect in China and the stores closed. And then, in March, as stores reopened, the recovery began. And then, we\u2019ve seen further recovery in April. Where that goes, we will see. But that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019ve seen so far there. To your question about store traffic, store traffic is obviously up from where it was in February, but it is not back to where it was pre the lockdown. There has been, however, more move to online. And as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, it\u2019s pretty phenomenal actually. Retail had a quarterly record for us during the quarter. And that\u2019s despite stores being closed for the three-week period around the world. And ex China -- and then China was closed prior to that three weeks. And that\u2019s partly because the online store had such a phenomenal quarter, and that included in China, but it was also other regions as well. So, there is definitely a move. And whether that\u2019s a permanent shift, I would hesitate to go that far, because I think people like to be out and about. They just know that now is not the time to do that.\nSamik Chatterjee: If I can just follow up on your previous comment about the strong demand you\u2019re seeing for iPhone SE. Just given the price point, I\u2019m wondering if you are expecting any change in terms of the geographic mix of where the demand comes from relative to typically what do you see for other iPhones from the line up on, just giving the lower price point?\nTim Cook: I think, it plays in every geo, but I would expect to see it doing even better in areas where the median incomes are less. And so, we\u2019ll see how that plays out. And I expect some fair number of people switching over to iOS. So, it\u2019s an unbelievable offer. It\u2019s, if you will, the engine of our top phones in a very affordable package. And I think -- and it\u2019s faster than the fastest Android phones. And so, it\u2019s an exceptional value.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? \nOperator: Certainly. Our last question today will be from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. I wanted to follow up with another question on iPhone SE and the decision to bring it back and where it sits within the total iPhone strategy. And I guess, coupled with the fact that iPhone 11, you made the decision to bring that at a lower price point. What does that tell us with respect to your approach to iPhone pricing and flexibility? Is this helping to add users and kind of bring people into the ecosystem? And if so, what does that imply for gross margins?\nTim Cook: Chris, we\u2019ve always been about delivering the best product at a good price. And that fundamental strategy has not changed at all. As you know, we did have an SE for a while. It\u2019s great to bring it back. It was a beloved product. And so, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that other than we want to give people the best deal that we can while making the best product.\nChris Caso: Okay. As a follow-up -- the follow-up question is on commodity pricing. And I think, you had expected to see some commodity price declines through the March quarter. If you could talk about what you expect, as you go through the year, perhaps in this new environment, and again, whether that turns into a challenge or a headwind for gross margins as you go into the second half?\nTim Cook: Yes. For March, Chris, we saw NAND pricing increase slightly while DRAM and displays and the other commodities declined. For the June quarter, we would expect NAND and DRAM pricing to remain at this historically low level, while displays and most other commodity prices we expect to decline.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Chris.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speaks as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We're thrilled to report Apple's biggest quarter ever, which set new all-time records in both revenue and earnings. We generated revenue of $91.8 billion, which is above the high-end of our guidance range, with revenue growth accelerating for the third consecutive quarter. Geographically, we set all-time records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Specific and saw Greater China return to growth. Our record performance was fueled by iPhone where December quarter revenue was up 8% year-over-year and by our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth outside of iPhone including a new all-time record for services and another blowout quarter for Wearables. Our active installed base of devices has now surpassed 1.5 billion, up over 100 million in the last 12 months alone, reaching a new all-time high for each of our main product categories and geographic segments. Not only is our large and growing installed base a powerful testament to the satisfaction, engagement and loyalty of our customers, but it's also fueling our growth across the board, particularly in services. Let\u2019s take each category one by one. On iPhone, revenue in the December quarter was $56 billion, again that\u2019s up 8% over a year ago, thanks to the exceptional demand for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max. In fact, iPhone 11 was our top-selling model every week during the December quarter and the three new models were our three most popular iPhones. We had double-digit growth in many developed markets, including the U.S., the UK, France and Singapore, and also grew double digits in emerging markets led by strong performances in Brazil, Mainland China, India, Thailand, and Turkey. These new models are by far the best iPhones we've ever shipped with advance technologies and unprecedented leap in battery life to easily get through the day and our best-in-class camera experience. We have been wild with the photos customers have shared in our all-new Night Mode photo challenge this month. Turning to services. Q1 revenue reached $12.7 billion, an all-time record, growing 17% over last year. Once again, we saw double-digit growth in all five of our geographic segments and established new all-time records from multiple categories including cloud services, music, payment services and our App Store search ad business, as well as setting a December quarter record for the App Store and AppleCare. 2019 was a historic year for our services business, and I\u2019d like to touch on some highlights. For the App Store, 2020 started off strong with customers spending a new single day record $386 million on New Year's Day alone, a 20% increase over last year. Apple Arcade, our new game subscription service has been fast off the blocks with a catalog of over 100 new and exclusive games you won\u2019t find anywhere else, all playable across Apple devices with new games and expansions added every month. Apple TV+ is off to a rousing start, and I want to congratulate the entire team at The Morning Show for their multiple Golden Globe nomination. Jennifer Aniston on her Screen Actors Guild award and Billy Crudup on his Critics Choice award. We continue to focus on telling stories that matter, like Little America, which recently premiered to widespread critical acclaim with much more great content still to come. Apple News now draws over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S., UK, Australia and Canada, and provides a curated and personalized experience using on-device intelligence to recommend stories. Apple News+ continues to add new titles, offering subscribers seamless access to the world\u2019s top publications across all of their devices. For Apple Pay, revenue and transactions more than doubled year-over-year with the run rate exceeding 15 billion transactions a year. Apple Pay transit support expanded with customers paying for journeys on transport for London more easily with Apple Pay Express Transit. And in spring of 2020, iPhone and Apple Watch customers will be able to simply tap to ride trains and buses in even more cities including Shenzhen and Guangzhou. We are thrilled with the continued growth at Apple Card. And last month, the customers began using Apple Card monthly installments at Apple retail and online to purchase new iPhones and pay for them over 24 months. We see great promise for these recently launched services, and we're optimistic about what we've got in the pipeline for each of them. Now, turning to Wearables. We had another incredible quarter, setting an all-time record in virtually every market we track around the world, and this product category is now the size of a Fortune 150 company. Demand for AirPods continues to be phenomenal, particularly for our recently launched AirPods Pro, our new addition to the AirPods family that features active noise cancellation. Apple Watch had a great start to fiscal 2020, setting an all-time revenue record during the quarter. It continues to have a profound impact on our customers\u2019 lives and it continues to further its reach as over 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter were new to Apple Watch. Both AirPods and Apple Watch were must have holiday gifts, helping drive unprecedented results for the category, even as we face supply constraints for Apple Watch Series 3 and AirPods Pro. Mac and iPad generated $7.2 billion and $6 billion in revenue, respectively, and the high level of customer satisfaction and loyalty for both products drove the active installed base of both Mac and iPad to new records in all geographic segments. For iPad, we saw growth in key emerging markets like Mexico, India, Turkey, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, with our current line-up of iPad Pro, iPad Air, iPad Mini and iPad, along with the new iPadOS will give the customers an unparalleled tablet experience integrating hardware, software and services in a way that only Apple can. This was also a very exciting quarter for the Mac as we launched our most powerful notebook ever. The 16-inch MacBook Pro, as well as Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR, the most powerful tools Apple has ever put into hands of Pros. And we\u2019ve already seen a strong response from the Pro community from developers, photographers and music producers to filmmakers and scientists who rely on the Mac to create their life\u2019s best work. We also want to take a moment to congratulate all the Grammy winning and nominated artists this past weekend who rely on Logic Pro 10 and the Mac to create incredible music we all love. I want to call out and celebrate the exceptional work of our retail and online teams. This quarter, we opened a beautiful new store in Kawasaki, Japan. And exciting things are taking place inside each and every store. Thanks in part to a doubling in iPhone trade-ins versus last year, our retail and online stores set an all-time record and delivered strong double-digit growth in iPhone. We see a very bright future for these efforts and we continue to innovate to ensure that everyone who visits an Apple retail location has a great experience. We began 2020 with our greatest product line-up ever and we are only deepening our commitment to do our part to make the world a better place. In November, we released a completely redesigned Everyone Can Code curriculum to help introduce more elementary and middle school students to the world of coding. The new curriculum includes even more resources for teachers, a brand new guide for students and updates Swift Coding Club materials. Today, millions of students in more than 5,000 schools worldwide use Everyone Can Code curriculum to bring their ideas to life and develop important skills, including creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving. November also saw the launch of our new research app, the latest in our ongoing effort to put the future of health in the hands of every user. Customers in the U.S. can enroll in three landmark multiyear health studies that we\u2019re undertaking with leading academic and research institutions. The Apple Women's Health Study, the Apple Heart And Movement Study and the Hearing Study, as in everything we do, we build user privacy into the research app from the ground up. This quarter we also announced a $2.5 billion plan to help address the housing availability and affording crisis in our home state of California. We feel a great responsibility to help the region we have always called home stay vibrant and to ensure that it remains a great place for everyone to live and raise a family, including those who do so much to serve the community, like firefighters and teachers. In much more recent news, we\u2019re closely following the development of the coronavirus. We're donating two groups that are working to contain the outbreak, we're working closely with our Apple team members and partners in the affected areas, and our thoughts are with all of those affected across the region. As we close the books on a record-breaking December quarter, we are already well underway on some new and exciting developments for the future. Apple\u2019s strength will always be its boundless creativity and innovation, and this year will be no different. But for now, for more details on the results, I would like to turn the call over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Our business and financial performance in the December quarter were exceptional as we set new all-time records for revenue, net income and earnings per share. Revenue for the quarter was $91.8 billion, up $7.5 billion or 9% from a year ago, in spite of a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange. Geographically, we established all-time revenue records in many major developed and emerging markets including, among others, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Brazil, the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Products revenue was $79.1 billion, up 8% as iPhone returned to growth, and we had incredibly strong results in Wearables where we set all-time records for both Apple Watch and AirPods. Services revenue grew 17% to a new all-time record, $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in every geographic segment and new all-time records across our portfolio. Company gross margin was 38.4%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage from higher revenue, despite of a negative 60 basis-point impact from foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 34.2%, up 260 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage and favorable mix. Services gross margin was 64.4%, up 30 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix. Our reported tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%. Before discrete items, the rate was 16.5%, exactly in line with our guidance. A favorable one-time item impacted the rate by 230 basis points. Net income was an all-time record of $22.2 billion, up $2.3 billion or 11% over last year. Diluted EPS was also an all-time record at $4.99, up 19% and operating cash flow was a very strong $30.5 billion, an improvement of $3.8 billion over a year ago. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue of $56 billion grew 8% year-over-year, as we saw a great customer response to the launch of our newest iPhones. We set all-time revenue records in several countries, including the U.S. Mexico, the UK, France, Spain, Poland, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam. Our active installed base of iPhones has reached an all-time high and is growing in each of our geographic segments. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max combined. Among business buyers planning to purchase smartphones in the next quarter, 84% plan to purchase iPhones. Turning to services. We set an all-time revenue record of $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in all of our five geographic segments. As Tim mentioned, we established new all-time records for Apple Music, cloud services, payment services and our App Store search ad business and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. We are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of doubling our fiscal year \u201816 services revenue during 2020. We've actually already reached that goal on a run-rate basis with the results of the December quarter. Customer engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow and the number of both, transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits in all of our geographic segments. We now have over 480 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 120 million from a year ago. And at this point, we expect to hit our goal of surpassing the 500 million mark already during the March quarter. Given the tremendous momentum we're experiencing across our services offerings, we're increasing our target for paid subscriptions and aim to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. App Store revenue grew strong double digits, thanks to robust customer demand for both in-app purchases and subscriptions. Our third-party subscription business grew across multiple categories and increased almost 40% year-over-year. Our first-party subscription services also continued to perform extremely well. Apple Music set an all-time revenue record, offering a catalog of over 60 million songs to our customers. iCloud also generated an all-time revenue record, growing very-strong double digits while offering our customers a safe, secure and seamless experience across all their devices. It was a December quarter record for AppleCare, thanks to strong service agreement attach rates and expanded distribution, many of our partners have come to appreciate the strength of the AppleCare brand and our ability to deliver the very-best service and support in the world. That value resonates with both our partners and our customers, and we are very happy to see that quality of experience delivered to more and more of our users. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about Mac and iPad. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion and iPad revenue was $6 billion. Both products had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the launches of MacBook Air here, Mac mini and iPad Pro during the December quarter a year ago and the subsequent channels fill. Despite the tough compare, on a demand basis, our performance for both Mac and iPad was around even to last year. Importantly, around half of the customers purchasing Macs and iPads around the world during the quarter, were new to that product. And the active installed base of both Mac and iPad reached a new all-time high. The most recent surveys from 451 Research measured a 93% customer satisfaction rating for iPad from consumers and 92% from businesses, and among both consumers and businesses were planning to purchase tablets in the March quarter 78% plan to purchase iPads. Wearables, home and accessories established a new all-time record with revenue of $10 billion, up 37% year-over-year with very strong double-digit performance across all five geographic segments and growth across Wearables, accessories and home. We set all-time records for Wearables in virtually every market we track, even as we experience some product shortages due to very strong customer demand for both Apple Watch and AirPods during the quarter. We also continued to see strong demand for our products in the enterprise market as our technology solutions enable businesses to do their best work. 100% of Fortune 500 companies in the healthcare sector use Apple technology in areas such as patient experience, clinical communications and nursing workflows, and we're also seeing smaller companies in this sector drive innovation with our technology and apps. One example is Gauss Surgical, which uses Core ML in iOS to more accurately estimate blood loss during child birth and surgery. This helps clinicians have more complete and timely information on whether a patient needs an intervention, which can impact both, clinical outcomes and costs. Another example is Butterfly Network, a medical imaging company, which makes handheld ultrasound device that connects to iPhone or iPad to enable clinicians to take an ultrasound anywhere at a cost that is dramatically lower than other solutions in the market today. Let me now turn to our cash positions. We ended the quarter with $207 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued a 2 billion euro-denominated green bond, retired $1 billion of maturing debt and reduced commercial paper by $1 billion during the quarter, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $99 billion at the end of the quarter and we maintained our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. We returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. We began a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30.4 million shares. We also repurchased 40 million Apple shares for $10 billion, through open market transactions, and we paid $3.5 billion in dividends and equivalents. As we have done for the last several years, we would share our plans for the next phase of our capital return program when we report results for the March quarter. Finally, as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $63 billion and $67 billion. The wider than usual revenue range comprehends uncertainty related to the recently unfolding public health situation in China. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. We expect OpEx to be between $9.6 billion and $9.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $250 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 16.5%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.77 per share of common stock, payable on February 13, 2020 to shareholders of record as of February 10, 2020. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may have the first question, please?\nOperator: Yes. That will be from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. I guess, first one for me on Wearables, fairly impressive to see, it\u2019s already a $10 billion business for you guys. Could you just touch on the growth that you are seeing on the Wearables side? How much the growth you think is coming from first time buyers of AirPods or Apple Watch versus folks that seem to be just upgrading the products that they have, because it looks to us the adoption rate is fairly low in your installed base, so there should be a long run way, but love to just understand how you see the growth divided between those two buckets.\nTim Cook: Yes. Amit, it\u2019s Tim. If you look at the Apple, the Wearables as a category within the Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue, Wearables grew 44%. So, it was very strong, as you say. Both Apple Watch and AirPods did very well in terms of collecting new customers. Apple Watch in particular, 75% of the customers are new to the Apple Watch. And so, it\u2019s still very much a selling to new customers at this point.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. And I guess, Luca, you could just touch on gross margins. The March quarter guide I think implies gross margin of flat to actually up 10, 15 basis point. It's rare for you guys to actually guide gross margins up in March I think because you have a fairly high seasonal sales deleverage happening. So, what are the offsets that's enabling what looks like a better than seasonal guide for gross margins?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. That's right, Amit. It\u2019s about flat sequentially, and by the way significantly higher on a year-over-year basis. But on a sequential basis, you are right, on one side we got the loss of leverage from the usual seasonality but we expect that that loss of leverage will be offset by better mix and cost savings.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Tom Forte with D.A Davidson.\nTom Forte: So, congrats on the launch of Apple TV+. I wanted to know internally, how you're getting success, is it truly on critical acclaim, is it on number of consumers that are using the service, contribution and service revenue, et cetera, et cetera? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Hey, Tom, it\u2019s Tim. We are primarily measuring our sales on the number of subscribers. As you can tell from the way that we launched the product, we started with a very aggressive price at $4.99. And in addition to that we have our bundle where if you buy pretty much any device, you\u2019re getting a year for free. And so, we're very focused on subscribers. That said, the product itself is about storytelling. And we think if we do that well, then we will find that there will be some number of those that will also be critical acclaimed. And we're seeing that with the morning show, we're seeing that with Little America and others.\nTom Forte: Great. And then, my second question is I think you indicated that last month we started offering consumers the ability to use their Apple Card to buy an iPhone on an installment basis. Can you talk about how that\u2019s had an impact on your unit sales for iPhones?\nTim Cook: So, retail stores did fantastic on iPhone, very strong double-digit growth in iPhone from a year-over-year point of view. And one of the factors that enabled that was the -- getting to a monthly payments on the Apple Card to make it very simple. Of course, that\u2019s U.S. only at this point, but the U.S. is very key market for us. And so, it was an important part of it.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Tom. Can we have the next question, please? \nOperator: That will come from Shannon Cross, Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I wanted to go back to revisit China. Tim, can you talk about what you are seeing in the region -- what you were seeing in the region prior to the health crisis? And then, can you also update us a bit in terms of your manufacturing strategy, dual-sourcing, geographic diversification, even with the region, just so we have some idea of how this will be managed? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. Thanks,, Shannon. In terms of China, the results from last quarter, and then I will get into the coronavirus in a second. For the results from last quarter, we had double-digit growth for iPhone in Mainland China. So, that was an important change from where we've been running. We also had double-digit growth in services in Mainland China and we had extremely strong double-digit on Wearables. And so, really, there were a number of different factors in terms of the things that customers are responding to. iPhone 11 is doing well there, the product has been very well-received with its battery life and the camera is unbelievable. We also, as you probably know, have certain trading programs going and financing programs. These have also been well received. And so, it\u2019s sort of the sum of all of this. And we are tracking quite a large percentage of new customers on products like the Mac. Three quarters of the customers buying a Mac in China are new, and nearly two-thirds of the customers buying iPad are new. So, it was a terrific quarter. We had three of the top four selling smartphones in urban China according to Kantar. In terms of the coronavirus, as I mentioned earlier, first and foremost, our thoughts are with all of those that are affected across the region. And as I've mentioned, we\u2019re donating to groups that are working to contain the outbreak. We are also working very closely with our team and our partners in the affected areas, and we have limited travel to business critical situations as of last week. The situation is emerging and we're still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely. As Luca had mentioned, we have a wider than usual revenue range for the second quarter due to the greater uncertainty. I'll talk about supply chain and customer demand some to give you some color. With respect to the supply chain, we do have some suppliers in the Wuhan area. All of these suppliers, they\u2019re our ultimate sources, and we\u2019re obviously working on mitigation plans to make up any expected production loss. We've factored best thinking and the guidance that we've provided you. With respect to supply sources that are outside the Wuhan area, the impact is less clear at this time. The reopening of those factories after Chinese New Year has been moved from the end of this month to February 10th, depending upon the supplier location, and we've attempted to account for this delayed start up through our larger range of outcomes that Luca mentioned earlier. With respect to customer demand and sales, we've currently closed one of our retail stores and a number of channel partners have also closed their store fronts. Many of the stores that remain opened have also reduced operating hours. We're taking additional precautions and frequently deep-cleaning our stores as well as conducting temperature checks for employees. While our sales within the Wuhan area itself are small, retail traffic has also been impacted outside of this area, across the country in the last few days. And again, we have attempted to account for this in our guidance range that we\u2019ve provided you. I hope that gets you some color.\nShannon Cross: Yes. That was very helpful. Luca, maybe if you could just touch on from a gross margin from perspective, the commodity pricing environment and availability. Obviously, there has been some movement on DRAM and NAND. So, if you can talk about how you are thinking about inventory levels and managing that going forward? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. As I said earlier to the question around the gross margin guidance for the March quarter, we are seeing a benign commodity environment. Most commodities have been declining during the December quarter, and we expect the same to happen in the March quarter. As always, and as you probably know, we look at the way these prices move and at times when we feel it\u2019s appropriate we buy certain commodities in advance. And so, we will continue that practice as we go through the year.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Luca, can you address the modest slowdown in services growth this quarter, 17% versus 18% in September? Which services categories accelerated versus where did you see some deceleration in the growth?\nLuca Maestri: Katy, let me make a couple of comments here. The 17% during the December quarter, we look at it against our fiscal year \u201819 growth rate, which was 16%. So, we feel very good about the results for the December quarter. As Tim and I mentioned during our prepared remarks, it was very broad-based growth because we grew double digits in services across all the five geographies. We set all-time records for many, many categories, music, cloud, search ads, payment services, December records for the App Store and the AppleCare. If you remember, we had set two goals for ourselves in the services segment. The first, we set a goal to double our fiscal \u201816 revenue during 2020. And when we look at it on a run rate basis, we\u2019ve already achieved that goal with the results of the December quarter. We also set a goal to pass 500 million paid subscriptions during 2020. And given that we are already at 480 at the end of December, we expect to pass that mark during the March quarter. So, now, we are setting a new target for ourselves for paid subscriptions. And so, we are now aiming to reach 600 million before the end of calendar 2020. So, we feel that the services business is growing incredibly well. Of course, we have launched new services very recently. For example, Apple TV+ just launched in November. And so, while these services did not have a material impact in our December quarter results, we expect that over time they start contributing to the growth of the services business. But, we feel very happy with the 17%.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you for that. Tim, as a follow-up, at some point in the future, Apple will launch a 5G iPhone. How big of a demand driver do you view 5G capability in a handset? And what's your view as to what the killer app will be from a consumer perspective?\nTim Cook: Sorry. We don\u2019t comment on future products. And so, I will try to sidestep a bit. With respect to 5G, I think it\u2019s -- we're in the early innings of its deployment on a global basis. We obviously couldn\u2019t be prouder of our lineup and are very excited about our pipeline as well and wouldn\u2019t trade our position for anybody.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Katie. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\nKyle McNealy: So, we were seeing some signs of new spectrum being deployed for 5G deployments and even additional 4G capacity, and it\u2019s already having a positive impact for handset upgrades to use that new capacity? Do you get the sense that wireless carriers are getting more incentivize to upgrade handsets to get a leverage out of these new network investments? How much might this be helping, and do you think it will continue to accelerate?\nTim Cook: I think that we\u2019ve had some great partners, not only in the U.S. but also around the world that are really helpful this quarter, as partners. And so, I think that probably a part of that is the level of investments they have. And then, a part of it is probably making sure that those customer stick with them in a environment where there's a lot of trading back and forth. So, I am optimistic that it will continue.\nKyle McNealy: Okay, great. And then, the comment that you made about capacity in the Wearables division with AirPods Pro and Apple Watch 3, what should we think about the timeline of when those capacity constraints might be alleviated? And will they come from capacity additions or the natural workout of unit shipments and something on the demand side?\nTim Cook: I'm hopeful that the Series 3 will come in to balance during this quarter. On AirPods Pro, I don't have estimate for that for you. I just can't predict when at this point. We seem to be fairly substantially off their and we're working very hard to put in additional capacity.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Kyle. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Thank you. Tim, Apple has a very valuable installed base of users. Can you see a future where Apple can become larger in the advertising market, as you build out TV+, given you could have the unique position and ability to drive targeted ads to users without compromising on privacy?\nTim Cook: I think, it is possible to have advertising in a straightforward manner that doesn\u2019t encroach on people's privacy. I wouldn\u2019t want to conjecture about us in that business. I think for the TV+ business, we feel strongly that what the customer wants is an add-free product, and so that's not our aversion to ads, it\u2019s what we believe that a customer wants.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you. And Luca, can you just clarify if the services revenue this quarter had any impact of deferrals associated with TV+ at all? And how can you help us maybe size the impact of the amortization of the content costs associated with TV+ as we think about the next couple of years? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So, yes. Of course, we launched the service and so there was a very small contribution to revenue from the deferral, and there was also contribution to revenue from the people, the subscribers that are actually paying for the service. When you think about what goes into the Apple TV+ revenue, at this point, there are two components. There is paid subscribers, these are the customers that pay for the service and we recognize revenue over the subscription period. And then, we got the what we call the Apple TV+ bundle subscribers. These are the customers that buy an eligible hardware device and redeem the offer for a three-year of TV+ services. We deferred revenue for this offer, based on three items, the first one is the value of the service that is being provided, the one year of Apple TV+. The second one is the number of customers that are eligible for the offer. And the third one is our estimate of the expected number of customers that will redeem the offer. So, you need to keep in mind that from our total eligible device sales, you need to make a number of reductions for family sharing, for multiple device purchases and for geographic availability. Also, the take rate can also be impacted by the availability of local content, and we also require a payment method on file. So, this estimate is reviewed quarterly and gets updated based on actual trends of the offer. So, these inputs provide us with the amount of revenue that we deferred for each device sale that then gets recognized over the one-year period that the TV plus service has provided. So, when you take the combination of paid subscribers and bundled subscribers, you get the Apple TV+ revenue. Of course because we\u2019ve launched the service very recently, the amount of revenue that we recognized during the quarter, was immaterial to our results. With regard to the cost of developing the content, we -- essentially as we incur these costs, we put them on the balance sheet and then we amortize over a certain period of time depending on the type of content that we produce.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear from Cowen and Company's Krish Sankar.\nKrish Sankar: I had two questions. First one, Tim, I just wanted to pick your brain a little bit on the overall smartphone market. There is a general view that when 5G phones come out they\u2019re going to be more expensive due to higher component costs, but at the same time, it looks like you guys have proven that there is a market for low cost geographies to phones like iPhone SE. So, how do you see these two different segments within the smart phone market evolving over the next one to three years? And then, I had a follow-up for Luca.\nTim Cook: Again, I\u2019m going to stay away from commenting about future products. But, generally, I think it\u2019s important when you think about 5G is to look around the world at the different deployment schedules. And some of those look very different perhaps than what you might be seen here. And so, that\u2019s very important. In terms of the price, I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on the price of handsets that aren\u2019t announced.\nKrish Sankar: And then, a follow-up for Luca. OpEx as a percentage of sales for March looks like e about 15% higher than in your prior quarters. Kind of curious how much of that is -- part of it is driven by some of your Intel modem asset purchases or TV+ in the OpEx or how do we think about it on a go forward basis? \nLuca Maestri: Yes. I think we felt good about our OpEx results, because they were at the low end of our guidance range. But clearly, we want to make all the necessary investments in the business. And in terms of the new services, not only for TV+ but all the new services that we launched during 2019, this is period where we\u2019re making the necessary investments in advertising and marketing, and that level of investment is reflected in our OpEx results. And also, as you correctly stated, we completed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business unit in December quarter. And so, we had -- we reflected the run rate of the expenses related to that business, partially during the quarter, after the completion of the transaction. And that is a very important core technology for the Company. So, we will continue to make all the necessary investments also there. There is a third category of expenses that affected the December quarter, and it\u2019s a fact that our revenue was very strong, and we have certain valuable expenses. For example, credit card fees that are associated with the higher volume and of course impacted our OpEx results.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will be from Mike Olson with Piper Sandler.\nMike Olson: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, slightly different take on an earlier question on Wearables, and that is, what impact you think Wearables is driving people into the Apple ecosystem? You mentioned 75% watch buyers are new to the Apple Watch, but are many of them new to Apple overall? I'm sure a lot of existing iPhone, iPads or Mac users are going to Wearables customers, but do you think Wearables bring people into the ecosystem to buy other devices in a material way?\nTim Cook: I think that -- Mike, it\u2019s Tim. With each Apple product that a customer buys, I think, they get tighter into the ecosystem because they like -- that's the reason that they're buying into it, is they like the experience, the customer experience. And so from that point of view, I think each of our products can drive another product. I would think, in that case it\u2019s more likely that the iPhone comes first, but there's no doubt in my mind that there's some people that came into the ecosystem for the Watch.\nMike Olson: Okay. And then, I think you recently mentioned that augmented reality will pervade our entire lives. And I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts about how you think it starts to impact our lives most significantly. For example, will the inflection point in AR come from gaming or industrial usage or some other category? In other words, where will the average person kind of first feel that impact of AR on their lives in a significant way? Thanks.\nTim Cook: I think, when you look at AR today, you would see that there are consumer applications, there are enterprise applications. This is the reason I'm so excited about it is, you rarely have a new technology where business and consumer are both see it as key to them. And so, I think, the answer is --- that's the reason, I think it\u2019s going to pervade your lives is because it\u2019s going to go across business and your home life. I think, these things will happen in parallel. There are already companies that are deep into enterprise business that are working on applications for the enterprise. And of course you can see -- you go on to store, see thousands of apps that are AR kit enabled at this time and would even more coming.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Raymond James, Chris Caso.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. I guess, the first question is on gross margins. And you spoke about the favorable mix. Wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. And clearly, iPhone is doing well within the overall mix that growing year-on-year. But, if you could talk about what's happening to the mix within iPhone, is that improving as well and also helping margins? And is there anything else you would point to with regard to the overall mix in margins?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. And I think that the mix helped us both in Q1 and it\u2019s helping us with the guidance for Q2. And as you said, some of it is mix of iPhones. The customer response for iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max is being exceptional. And that clearly has helped our mix. iPhone 11 was our top selling model throughout the quarter, every single week of the quarter. And so certainly, better mix within iPhone. The other point that I would like to point out is that as we move from Q1 to Q2, the proportion of revenue coming from services increases versus the holiday quarter. And given that fact that services are accretive to gross margin for the Company, we end up getting a better mix from services as well.\nChris Caso: Okay. Thank you. And I guess, follow-on question with regard to OpEx. And it has been growing at a faster rate than revenue for I guess largely over the last three years or so. Can you set us some expectation with regard to when you get a return on that investment? I understand there are new investments that are happening now. But, how should we think about potential leverage going forward? Is there a point in time where the OpEx spending tend to level off and you get some return on that or is it just the function of a faster revenue growth in future?\nLuca Maestri: Well, I would start by saying that our expense to revenue ratio is incredibly competitive relative to other companies in our sector. There are years when our OpEx grows faster than our revenue but we also had years in the recent past where the opposite has happened. We continue to believe that we have a lot of great opportunities in front of us. And just if you look this past year, we launched many new initiatives, for example, on the services front, which we want to support with the appropriate level of investment, and not only marketing and advertising but also in R&D. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the acquisition of the Intel baseband business because we think it\u2019s a very important strategic core technology for the Company going forward. And I think from the results that you\u2019ve seen during this quarter and the guidance that we provided for the March quarter, I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of balancing the level of investments that we\u2019re making on the expense front, with the level of returns that we get both in terms of revenue and in terms of profitability that we\u2019re getting. Our net income for example was up 11% during the December quarter.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: That will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I just wanted to kind of ask on the iPhone revenue growth, definitely good to see return to growth. Based on the velocity and momentum you\u2019re seeing for the products exiting the quarter, how comfortable are you feeling about sustaining growth in iPhone revenues through year? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: We have a practice of forecasting the current quarter. And so, we\u2019ve given you the range that we expect for the current quarter and really don't give a range beyond that.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. So, if I can just maybe then follow up in terms of -- obviously, you\u2019ve returned to growth in most of the regions you report. One of the regions that are declining is Japan. So, if you can share your thoughts on what actions you need to take there to return that segment and that geography to grow? And what are the product trends there and what's probably the headwind that's kind of limiting growth there?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So, Japan was down 10% during the December quarter. It was primarily due to iPhone performance, which was challenged because there were some regulatory changes that took effect on the 1st of October where essentially the regulators decoupled the mobile phone pricing from the two-year contract and are capping the maximum amount of carrier discounts that can be made. At the same time, I would say, within a more difficult macro environment, iPhone did incredibly well during the quarter, six of the top seven selling smart models in Japan during the December quarter were iPhones. So, it was very strong performance by iPhone in a difficult environment. Also, in Japan, we had very strong double-digit growth from services, stronger than Company average; and very strong double-digit growth in Wearables, also stronger than Company average. So, we feel very good. Japan is a country where historically we\u2019ve had great success. The customers are very loyal and very engaged and we have very strong position there, we feel we have a very good momentum.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Samik.

Thank you all for your participation."}], "2022": [{"symbol": "AAPL", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-10-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking today first is Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook; and he\u2019ll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we\u2019ll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you\u2019ll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple\u2019s most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Tejas, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. A year ago, I spoke to you about the atmosphere of uncertainty in which we were living and the way it had come to define our daily experience, both as people and as a company. Today, much has changed, profoundly so. And while we are still living through unprecedented times, we are encouraged by progress around the world. I\u2019m grateful to our teams who have stayed resolutely focused on our customers and the pursuit of innovation on their behalf. We\u2019ve aimed to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be. Whether it\u2019s public health workers managing vaccination campaigns on iPhone or students returning to classrooms full of iPads or family staying connected over FaceTime, it is an honor to know that what we make matters and to see that reflected in the world and in our performance. This fiscal year, we reported $366 billion of revenue, which represents 33% annual growth. We also achieved more than 20% growth across all of our product categories and in every geographic segment. And today, Apple is reporting another very strong quarter. Demand was very robust, and we set a new September quarter record of $83.4 billion, up 29% from last year and in line with what we discussed on our last call, despite larger-than-expected supply constraints. We estimate these constraints had around a $6 billion revenue dollar impact, driven primarily by industry-wide silicon shortages and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions. Even so, we set an all-time record for Mac and quarterly records for iPhone, iPad, Wearables, Home and Accessories, representing 30% year-over-year growth in products. Our services business performed better than we expected, where we hit an all-time record of $18.3 billion and grew 26% year-over-year. And we set quarterly records in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth across the board. During fiscal 2021, we earned nearly one-third of our revenue from emerging markets and doubled our business in India and Vietnam. We are optimistic about the future, especially as we see strong demand for our new products. At the end of the September quarter, we introduced our iPhone 13 lineup as well as the Apple Watch Series 7, iPad and iPad mini, all of which represents significant advances. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, alongside the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, are setting a new standard with their superfast performance, advanced camera systems, longer battery life and brilliant Super Retina displays. Customers are loving the ninth generation iPad, which features a beautifully sharp display and twice the storage of the previous generation, as well as the new iPad mini, with its ultra portable design and impressive speed and performance. And we\u2019ve been thrilled with the reviews that Apple Watch Series 7 has earned for its larger display, faster charging and refined design. And just last week, we introduced the completely reimagined MacBook Pro powered by the extraordinary M1 PRO and M1 Max chips. These are our most powerful notebooks ever with game-changing performance and battery life, and the world\u2019s best notebook display. We think customers are going to love MacBook Pro, whether they\u2019re editing video in Final Cut Pro or making music in Logic Pro and so much more. They\u2019ll be able to do things never before possible on a notebook. We also announced our all-new AirPods that feature spatial audio and industry-leading sound, longer battery life and an all-new design. For the home, we added three new colors to our HomePod mini lineup, which offers seamless integration across Apple\u2019s products and services. We also announced a new subscription tier to Apple Music called Apple Music Voice, which offers subscribers access to the services catalog of 90 million songs all through the power of Siri. Across the board, teams at Apple continue to drive unmatched innovation through the seamlessly integrated hardware, software experience we\u2019ve long prided ourselves on. iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 have created more ways than ever to stay productive, whether choosing Focus to avoid distractions or Quick Note to capture a thought. macOS Monterey offers new ways to connect with friends and family, get more done and work fluidly across Apple devices. And watchOS 8 has made Apple Watch even more powerful and more ways than ever to stay active and to track your health on the go. We\u2019ve never had a more diverse range of services for our customers to choose from, and we\u2019ve been very encouraged by our performance, which reflects growing customer enthusiasm and satisfaction. In just its first two years, Apple TV+ has already proved itself to fans around the world. And I want to congratulate the incredible actors, writers, storytellers, producers and everyone else whose behind-the-scenes work has made that success possible. This quarter, Apple TV+ won 11 Emmys, including the Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. That show has continued to bring light and laughter to fans all over the world with its boundless optimism and beloved cast of characters. We couldn\u2019t be more proud of our entire lineup of content from the gripping second seasons of The Morning Show and Truth Be Told to our newest programs, Swagger, which is out tomorrow. The response has been incredible. This quarter also saw major updates to Fitness+, including the addition of new activities like meditation and pilates, and the announcement of group workouts, a feature that brings fitness and friends together. We also shared that Fitness+ will soon be available in 15 new countries, bringing workouts for every age and skill level to millions more people around the world. And those are just two of the services our customers are loving. This quarter, Apple Card won a J.D. Power award for customer satisfaction in its very first year of eligibility. The App Store continues to help people find the apps they depend on to stay productive, creative and entertained. And on Apple News, we launched a News Partner Program that expands Apple\u2019s support for journalism while creating an even better business opportunity for publishers. As we continue to support our customers around the world, we\u2019re glad to report we\u2019ve opened several new Apple Stores. This quarter, we opened a beautiful store in Changsha, which is our first store in the Hunan province of China. We also just opened our third store in Istanbul. And we recently added a store in the Bronx, which means we are now in all 5 boroughs of New York City. All of our stores are now open worldwide and have been for 7 weeks. As we enter our busiest time of year, I particularly want to share my gratitude for our retail teams. Customers have never relied on our products more, and our retail teams have truly answered the call. We meet our customers where they are with many ways to shop through our online and retail stores and can help them choose the best product for them and get it up and running. We are also excited about our education initiatives. This month, we introduced the Everyone Can Code Early Learners program, offering free resources, which helps students and elementary school learn coding. We see education not only as a fundamental good in its own right but is a great equalizing force. A world where all people can access a quality education isn\u2019t just a smarter world. It\u2019s a more equitable one. That desire to create a more just an equitable world is the guiding principle behind our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative. This quarter, Apple shared plans to expand our $100 million investment by an additional $30 million. Those funds will be used in a number of ways, including the creation of a new global Hispanic-serving institution equity and innovation hub. The hub will dramatically expand the technology and resources for students in the STEM fields. Those programs join our ever-expanding work with historically black colleges and universities, including the now 45 community coding centers and regional hubs, serving underrepresented communities across the United States. This month, we were also happy to welcome the inaugural class of developers and entrepreneurs to the Apple Developer Academy in Detroit. The academy is Apple\u2019s first in the United States and is designed to help prepare students for jobs in the thriving iOS app economy, which supports more than 2.1 million jobs across all 50 states. In August, we shared our impact accelerators first cohort of black, Latinx and indigenous-owned businesses whose pioneering work in green technology and clean energy serves many of the communities most impacted by climate change. More broadly, we are already carbon-neutral as a company. And this quarter, we made new strides towards reaching our goal of carbon neutrality across our entire supply chain and the life cycle of our devices by 2030. We\u2019ve made significant product advances in this area. iPad and iPad mini now come with 100% recycled aluminum enclosure. The antenna on iPhone 13 is made up of upcycled plastic water bottles, which marks an industry-first. And as our customers are seeing when they purchase iPhone 13, we\u2019ve redesigned the packaging to eliminate that outer plastic wrap, which will allow us to avoid using 600 metric tons of plastic. This brings us closer to removing all plastic in our packaging by 2025. We\u2019ve also made good progress toward our goal to one day make our products without taking anything from the earth. With Apple Watch Series 7, for example, 99% of the rare earth elements we use are recycled. Ahead of COP26, I\u2019m also pleased to report that we have more than doubled the number of our suppliers who have committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030. We\u2019re very encouraged to see the growth in this area, and we will continue to drive those changes in the supply chain in the months and years to come. We\u2019ve never viewed our environmental work as a side project. Teams across Apple are pushing this work forward in the same spirit of innovation we bring to our products and services. We are determined to be a ripple in the pond that drives a far greater change. From the pandemic to climate change to an equity and injustice, global challenges won\u2019t abide solitary solutions, and we feel a deep sense of responsibility to help. We are incredibly proud of the product lineup we have going into the holiday season, and we are encouraged by the customer response we\u2019ve seen. And while we cannot know exactly which path the pandemic will take the world down in the months to come, we feel quite confident that this new year will be driven by the values that guide us and by the innovation that defines us. With that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter. Luca?\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the September quarter, capping a record-setting fiscal year 2021. We set a September quarter revenue record of $83.4 billion, an increase of nearly $19 billion or 29% from a year ago, despite larger-than-expected supply constraints. We also reached new Q4 records in every geographic segment with strong double-digit growth in each one of them. And it was a record September quarter for both, products and services. On the product side, revenue was $65.1 billion, up 30% over a year ago as we experienced better-than-expected demand for our products, despite supply constraints that we estimated at around $6 billion. We grew in each of our product categories with an all-time record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone, for iPad and for Wearables, Home and Accessories. This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers and the strength of our ecosystem, drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record. Our services set an all-time revenue record of $18.3 billion, up 26% over a year ago, with September quarter records in every geographic segment and in every services category. Company gross margin was 42.2%, down 110 basis points from last quarter, due to higher costs and a different mix of products, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 34.3%, down 170 basis points sequentially as higher cost structures were partially offset by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 70.5%, up 70 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $20.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.24, both grew over 60% year-over-year and were September quarter records. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 47% year-over-year and set a September quarter record of $38.9 billion, despite supply constraints as customer demand was very strong. The iPhone 12 family continued to perform very well, and we are seeing enthusiastic customer response to the launch of our iPhone 13 family. We also grew double digits in each geographic segment, setting September quarter records in both, developed and emerging markets. The latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for iPhone, and our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high. For Mac, we set an all-time revenue record of $9.2 billion, despite supply constraints, driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Air. In fact, our last five quarters for Mac have been the best five quarters ever for the category. iPad performance was also strong with a September quarter revenue record of $8.3 billion, up 21%, in spite of significant supply constraints as customer demand for the iPad Pro also powered by M1 was very strong. For both, Mac and iPad, we continue to see a combination of high levels of customer satisfaction and first-time buyers. Around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And in the most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 97% for both, Mac and iPad. Our continued investment in iPad and Mac is taking computing to the next level. We have redesigned and reengineered both products to provide customers an unmatched experience, which resulted in record fiscal years for both categories. We are carrying this momentum also in the enterprise market. For example, SAP has already deployed Macs to tens of thousands of their employees to date. Following the launch of our new M1 MacBook Pro last week, SAP is planning to add it to the growing list of M1 Mac offerings available to their global workforce. Another example is France\u2019s national railway company, SNCF, which equips all train drivers with iPads to manage their entire daily workflow and train operations, helping to lower energy and maintenance costs. In fact, the iPads have been so well received that 90% of the drivers choose to purchase them for personal use at the end of the corporate device refresh cycle. Next, Wearables, Home and Accessories set a new September quarter record of $8.8 billion. We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category, which we believe improve the overall customer experience and showcase the integration between our products and services. Apple Watch, AirPods and HomePod mini are powerful devices in their own right, but paired with our other products, software and services, they create unique experiences, like switching audio seamlessly between devices on your AirPods. Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $18.3 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising, AppleCare and payment services and a September quarter record for the App Store. Our continued investment and strong execution in services has helped us deliver a record $68 billion in revenue during fiscal 2021, nearly tripling this category in six years. These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we are seeing on many fronts. First, our installed base continues to grow and reached an all-time high across each geographic segment. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the September quarter in each geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continued to show very strong growth. We now have more than 745 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million from last year and nearly 5 times the number of paid subscriptions we had less than five years ago. And finally, as Tim mentioned earlier, we\u2019re adding new services that we think our customers will love. And we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings. Fiscal \u201821 was not only a big year for services but for our entire company. During the past 12 months, we grew our business by 33% or $91 billion, reaching nearly $366 billion of revenue with record level performance across the board. Every product category and every geographic segment set a new annual revenue record and was up at least 20% over fiscal 2020. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $191 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $6.5 billion of new term debt, retired $1.3 billion of term debt and decreased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $125 billion. As a result, net cash was $66 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress towards our goal of net cash neutral over time. As our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, we were also able to return $24 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20 billion through open market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 5 million shares in the final settlement of our 17th ASR. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I\u2019d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. As we mentioned earlier, during the September quarter, supply constraints impacted our revenue by around $6 billion. We estimate the impact from supply constraints will be larger during the December quarter. Despite this challenge, we are seeing high demands for our products and expect to achieve very solid year-over-year revenue growth and to set a new revenue record during the December quarter. We expect revenue for each product category to grow on a year-over-year basis, except for iPad, which we expect to decline year-over-year due to supply constraints. For services, we expect our growth rate to decelerate from the September quarter but to remain strong. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.4 billion and $12.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on November 11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of November 8, 2021. With that, let\u2019s open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Tim, I\u2019m wondering, can you talk a bit more about specific supply chain issues you saw and how you\u2019ve seen improvements I think during the current quarter, and how we should think about what products do you expect to see most impacted going forward? Just any more color you can give us on what\u2019s going on out there because clearly, this is hitting everyone.\nTim Cook: Sure. If you look at Q4 for a moment, we had about $6 billion in supply constraints, and it affected the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac. We had -- there were two causes of them for Q4. One was the chip shortages that you\u2019ve heard a lot about from many different companies through the industry. And the second was COVID-related manufacturing disruptions in Southeast Asia. The second of those, the COVID disruptions, have improved materially across October to where we currently are. And so, for this quarter, we think that the primary cause of supply-chain-related shortages will be the chip shortage. It will affect -- it is affecting, I should say, pretty much most of our products currently and -- but from a demand point of view, demand is very robust. And so, part of this is the demand also is very strong. But we believe that by the time we finish the quarter that the constraints will be larger than the $6 billion that we experienced in Q4.\nShannon Cross: Okay, great. So, you\u2019ll sort of push forward in the next quarter as well. Can you -- just a different question because I\u2019m curious, you\u2019re starting to sell more and more things on a ratable basis. And how are you thinking about that? I mean, you have the new Macs and that we keep seeing. You can buy for a monthly charge in that. How do you think that\u2019s driving sales? And how should we think about percent maybe of the portfolio that\u2019s now available? And I don\u2019t know if you want to tell us how much revenue is now under a recurring nature, but it definitely seems as you\u2019re shifting more and more to maybe sort of a bundled sale or offering from a consumer standpoint where you just pay one price every month and you get all of your Apple devices and Apple services. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. The first product, Shannon, that really sold on a monthly basis was iPhone. And that began to happen in the U.S., as an example, shortly after the subsidy kind of world changed markedly. And so, I would say that predominantly, the mode of buying an iPhone in the United States is on a monthly kind of plan today. For the balance of the products, still the most popular would be buying them outright. But, we are seeing more and more demand for monthly payments. And so, we want to give the customer what they want. And so, you will see us do more and more things like that that will meet the customer where -- and provide the price that they want -- in a way that they want to pay for it. I don\u2019t know the percentage of products that are sold that way today, but it is increasing.\nOperator: We will hear next from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thanks a lot, and good afternoon, everyone. I have two as well. I guess, when I think about the supply chain headwinds, and you\u2019re talking about $6 billion in September, getting bigger in December. Tim, I would love to understand how do you guys comfort that this is really a demand that\u2019s getting deferred versus potentially getting destroyed at least somewhere else. And if you think about the supply chain bottlenecks -- you were the COO. You managed a lot of the stuff. Do you feel comfortable that sort of peaks in December and alleviates it from there, or what does the trajectory look like for improvement?\nTim Cook: Yes. What I feel comfortable on is I feel like we\u2019ve made great progress on the COVID-related disruptions, and that happened across the month of October, and we\u2019re in a materially better position today. It is difficult to predict COVID. And so, I\u2019m not going to predict where it goes. But I can just tell you that as of today, we\u2019re in a materially better position than we were in September and in the first several weeks of October. In terms of the chip shortage, the chip shortage is happening on legacy nodes. Primarily, we buy leading edge nodes, and we\u2019re not having issues on leading edge nodes. But on legacy nodes, we compete with many different companies for supply. And it\u2019s difficult to forecast when those things will balance because you\u2019d have to know how kind of -- how the economy is going to be in \u201822 and the accuracy of everyone else\u2019s demand projections. And so, I don\u2019t feel comfortable in making a prediction. I think, it would be subject to too much inaccuracy. But, I do feel very comfortable with our operational team. I think, we\u2019ve got a world-class one. And I\u2019m sure they\u2019re doing everything they can do to collapse cycle times and improve yields and do all the things that you can do in addition to fundamental capacity investment to remedy the situation.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then, Luca, if I may ask you a question on gross margins for December, you\u2019re essentially guiding gross margins to be flat to maybe down a little bit versus sort of September. Maybe just touch about it. So, I think historically, I would have expected gross margins to be up in December, given how much revenue leverage you end up with. So maybe, what are the puts and takes on gross margins that are resulting in a more flattish guide versus historical seasonality?\nLuca Maestri: Well, as you know, typically, obviously with December being the holiday season, we do get leverage, as you say. But, it\u2019s also the period of the year where we launch a lot of new products. And as you know, we launch essentially in every product category. We launch new products. Demand is very strong. But as you know, when we launch these new products, we tend to have higher cost structures at the beginning of the cycle. And so, that\u2019s what balances this out. Obviously, from a year-over-year standpoint, it\u2019s actually a significant expansion, right? Because when you look at what we did a year ago in the December quarter, 39.8%, this clearly indicates a significant expansion.\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Given the supply chain is blurring the demand picture for iPhone 13, what data points can you share that help investors understand whether demand is tracking to a product cycle that is flat, growing or down from the very strong iPhone 12? And maybe on that front, Luca, you can also comment on where you exited the quarter from a channel inventory standpoint for iPhone relative to a normal product cycle? And then, I\u2019ve got a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes. Look, maybe I can take both of those. Channel inventory, as you would expect in a constrained environment, the iPhone channel inventory ended below the targeted range and is currently below it. And so, that\u2019s that. In terms of the blurring of demand, we look at -- Katy, we look at a number of different data points. We look at demand across our online store, demand in retail. We look through to back orders on the carrier channels, the ones that do take back orders there. We look at channel orders as well. And so, we have a number of different data points that we use to conclude how strong demand is. And we feel very, very good about where demand is right now. And we\u2019re working feverishly on the supply side of that.\nKaty Huberty: And Tim, as a follow-up. We recently surveyed 4,000 consumers in the U.S. and China, and the feedback is most of them don\u2019t want to pay for apps or services direct with the developer. They value the security, privacy, ease of transactions with the App Store. So, how do you think about balancing the regulators push for more choice with a customer base that\u2019s happy with the existing experience? And just as a follow-on to that, how are you and Luca thinking about the potential impact of services revenue growth rate as some of the changes to the App Store go into effect?\nTim Cook: Katy, the main thing that we\u2019re focused on, on the App Store is to keep our focus on privacy and security. And so, these are the two major tenets that have produced over the years a very trusted environment where consumers and developers come together and consumers can trust the developers on the developers and the apps or what they say they are and the developers get a huge audience to sell their software to. And so, that\u2019s sort of number one on our list. Everything else is a distant second. And so, what we\u2019re doing is working to explain the decisions that we\u2019ve made that are key to keeping the privacy and security there, which is to not have sideloading and not have alternate ways on the iPhone, where it opens up the iPhone to unreviewed apps and also get by the privacy restrictions that we put on the App Store. And so, we\u2019re very, very focused in discussing the privacy and security elements of the App Store with the regulators and legislators.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you, guys. And I just have two quick questions, one big picture, theoretical. So, you covered the supply chain in pretty extensive detail on the call. But maybe just a bigger picture on how you\u2019re thinking about it philosophically given what you just sort of went through over the last 12 to 8 months. So, what I mean by that, is there sort of a recalibration needed or an adjustment around your supply chain philosophy either from a partner perspective or maybe a regional perspective? And how do you think about the current infrastructure and its ability to sort of rebound and sort of handle sort of these disruptions that seem to crop up from time to time? And then, I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes. I don\u2019t see a fundamental error that we\u2019ve made, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re picking out, in terms of creating the environment that we\u2019re in. It was created for a number of reasons. The pandemic came along. Some people in the industry and some people outside the industry thought that the pandemic would reduce demand. They pulled their orders down. Things reset. And what really happened was demand went up and went up even more than a straight trend would predict. And so, the industry is working through that now. I\u2019m making it little overly simplistic. There\u2019s some other things like yields and things like that that are happening as well. But, those things are mainly manageable in the course of time. And so, what we\u2019re doing is working with our partners on making sure that they have supply that we need and making sure that our demand statements are accurate as we see them and so forth. And at the same time, we are reducing our lead times and cycle times, so that when you get a chip off a fab that as quickly as possible, it\u2019s in a product and shipping and also helping the fab partners increase their yields. And so, those things are things that we\u2019re doing. We also support the CHIPS Act and investment there to put more investment in the ground. And so, we\u2019re spending some time advocating for the CHIPS Act as well.\nDavid Vogt: Great. And that\u2019s helpful. And I didn\u2019t mean to implicate that you guys had messed up, just maybe came off that way. And maybe just as a quick follow-up. When you think about purchasing devices ratably, you touched on that earlier. But maybe can you just touch on the partnerships that you have with carriers and the support that they have given you over the last couple of years. Now, it\u2019s been a key component of your success, the tight relationships that you have globally. Do you think sort of this business model, as it\u2019s currently sort of put together globally, is sort of a permanent structure, meaning carriers are going to be integral part of driving demand for iPhones, or is there a sense that maybe it\u2019s a little bit more transitory depending on the part of the cycle that we\u2019re in?\nTim Cook: I think that 5G has provided a once in a decade kind of upgrade potential, and it\u2019s a multiyear kind of thing. It\u2019s not a one year and done. And I think that we\u2019re motivated there. The carrier is motivated there. We have mutual interest and the customer benefits hugely from getting a new 5G phone that has 5G and a number of other features in it, too. And so, I think everybody is aligned on purpose. The model that you paint is -- I wouldn\u2019t call it a global model because there are different variations around the world depending upon the country. But, in general, I think that the marriage, if you will, or partnership between Apple and the carrier channel has never been stronger and that it\u2019s on very solid footing.\nOperator: So, we\u2019ll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.\nKrish Sankar: I had two of them, too. And Tim, I will give you a reprieve from the supply chain questions. I had two on services. The first one is on your new ATT, the ad tracking transparency feature, and all the headlines that have gone recently, I\u2019m kind of curious. The feedback you\u2019ve seen or received from your advertisers and users and how it has also impacted search ads your own ad business. Can you let us know the feedback? And then, I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: The feedback from customers is overwhelmingly positive. Customers appreciate having the option of whether they want to be tracked or not. And so, there\u2019s an outpouring of customer satisfaction there on the customer side. And the reason that we did this is that -- as you know, if you followed us for a while, we believe strongly that privacy is a basic human right and we believe that for decades, not just in the last year or so. And we\u2019ve historically rolled out more and more features over time for -- to place the decision of whether to share data and what data to share in the hands of the user where we believe that it belongs. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s Apple\u2019s role to decide, and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s another company\u2019s role to decide but rather the individual who owns the data itself. And so, that\u2019s our motivation there. There\u2019s no other motivation.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it, Tim. And that\u2019s a very fair characterization. Thank you for that. And then, as a quick follow-up, I\u2019m just kind of curious, on the mobile gaming in your App Store, there have been some recent actions by certain governments to limit game time. Kind of curious how that affects your App Store business in those geographies. And is there a way you can quantify that, or is it too immaterial at this point?\nTim Cook: You mean limiting the time on games. Is that what you\u2019re getting at?\nKrish Sankar: Yes, exactly. Like you\u2019re trying to decide to limit game time and things like that.\nTim Cook: It\u2019s very difficult to measure. Yes, with the policy that you\u2019re talking about for those people that don\u2019t know is there\u2019s a policy to restrict kids below a certain age to -- I think it\u2019s one hour on Friday, Saturday, Sunday each. And it\u2019s very difficult to see the impact of it on the App Store at this point.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I guess, Tim, I wanted to first start off on your comment about strong demand across products. And just specific to iPhone 13, if you can give us a bit more insight about what are you seeing in terms of intent, in terms of either upgrades from the installed base or even switchers rate too, if you can compare to iPhone 12 because some of the feedback we are getting is, for example, like strong switching activity in China. So just wondering if you can get a bit more granular there in terms of the -- what\u2019s driving the demand and who is it coming from. And then, I have a follow-up, please.\nTim Cook: It\u2019s so early to talk about iPhone 13 because it\u2019s only been on the market for less than 30 days now. What I can tell you is going into the cycle, if you look at our results from last quarter, we grew on upgraders and switchers in the double digits. And so, both were very meaningful for the iPhone results last quarter. And so, there\u2019s significant momentum in iPhone. And I would clearly characterize the demand that we\u2019re seeing currently as robust, as you can tell from the -- some of the quotes that we\u2019re quoting on the online store.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And as a follow-up, I guess, back to the supply chain but I wanted to just ask more relative to cost implications there. And what we\u2019re hearing is not only delays but also component cost going up. So, as we look through -- as I think about this upcoming cycle, how are you looking to manage component cost related headwinds? And is that something you\u2019re seeing coming through the supply chain? Thank you.\nTim Cook: We\u2019ve put our current thoughts in the gross margin guidance that we gave you, the 41.5% to 42.5%. I would tell you that we are seeing a significant increase in freight costs. And I would assume that that is pretty consistent across different companies. And so, we\u2019re clearly seeing some inflation there.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And I\u2019ll ask both my questions at the same time. Probably the first one is for Tim. On the services revenue, much better than expected. Can you give us some details about what drove that? Was it Apple Stores more open, so more AppleCare or more Apple One or Arcade or TV or Fitness? And then, probably for Luca on supply chain, when you mentioned supply chain headwind is going to get worse and you mentioned $6 billion this quarter, there\u2019s two ways to think about your terminology of worse. Is it the delta from $2 billion that you identified three months ago that went to $6 billion, so therefore, the delta of $4 billion gets worse, or are you just saying -- and therefore, it\u2019s above $10 billion for December quarter. Are you just saying it just gets higher than the $6 billion that you just identified earlier in the call?\nTim Cook: Jim, I\u2019m going to take the second question that you asked, and Luca could take the first one on services, just in the reverse of the way you coined it. On the supply constraints, what we\u2019re saying is that the amount of -- the nominal amount of supply constraints for Q1, we estimate to be larger than $6 billion. And so, it\u2019s important to know that we\u2019re getting a lot more supply in Q1 than we had in Q4, obviously, because our sequential growth is significant. And we have very solid growth year-over-year. And so, the amount of supply is growing dramatically. It\u2019s just that the demand is so robust that we envision having supply constraints for the quarter.\nLuca Maestri: And Jim, on services, the 26% growth rate that we had was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And it was really across the board. It\u2019s difficult to single out a specific area because we set all-time records on cloud. We set all-time records across the board, AppleCare, Music, video, advertising, payment services, the App Store was a September quarter, right? So, it was strong across the board. When we look at the services business, we always think about some fundamental factors that allow us to have good visibility over the sustainability of the business, right? The fact that the installed base continues to grow, that\u2019s obviously a positive. The fact that the number of people that are actually paying on the platform continues to grow double digits. And so, that obviously increases our opportunity. The number of subscriptions that we have on the platform, we mentioned during the call, 745 million paid subs right now. It\u2019s an increase of 160 million versus just 12 months ago, right? And obviously, the fact that we continue to launch new services, new offerings within the services that we already have, new features, that obviously gives us a lot of momentum going forward. We\u2019re very fortunate we have a very -- now it\u2019s a very large business, $68 billion in the last 12 months and very diversified. We sell a lot of different services and our customers seem to really enjoy the experience that they have on the platform.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChris Caso: For my first question, it\u2019s a question about your ability to recapture sales that you weren\u2019t able to fill in Q4, Q1 and Q2. And you have some experience in that from last year when the iPhone, not all the models launched at the same time and some are late, and you did recapture some of that as you went past the holidays. Do you think that we should expect similar behavior this year? And then, with that also is, will all product categories behave similarly? Meaning that are the some product categories where if you missed the holidays, you just missed the sale.\nTim Cook: I think there are some products that people buy as gifts that if it\u2019s not there that it\u2019s perishable. But I think that we have a lot of products as well that people will wait for and would expect those to be captured in a different time period. So, it\u2019s a combination for this certain quarter, the holiday quarter, I believe.\nChris Caso: Okay. As a follow-up, could you speak to iPhone mix? And one of the things we noted is that the delivery time for all iPhones are a bit long because of the constraints. They\u2019re a bit longer on the Pro and the Max. Is that a function of supply or demand or perhaps both? And again, I would imagine you have a little better handle on that this year, given that all the phones were launched at the same time.\nTim Cook: Yes. It\u2019s really too early to make comments on mix at this point because it has been -- we have been in a constrained environment. So, the mix becomes more obvious, once supply and demand are balanced.\nOperator: We\u2019ll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar: Yes. Hey, guys, first of all, a great job managing to the supply constraints. It\u2019s obviously affecting everybody. So congratulations. And then Tim, one for you, a strategic question. When Apple thinks about strategic areas that as a company that we own, for example, software is a high priority, but you\u2019re also one of the largest semiconductor companies if the company would stand alone. So, curious about the kind of input that -- thinking that goes into owning some piece of technology. For example, when we survey people, they say batteries and screens are very important. So, why doesn\u2019t Apple -- for example, what causes Apple from looking at areas like that?\nTim Cook: We look at ones where we believe we can make a substantial difference and have a level of differentiation. And so, we\u2019ve put a lot of energy in the silicon space because we have felt that we could design and develop products that we could not if we were in the -- just buying what\u2019s available on the commercial market. And as you can see, more recently, we made that call on the Mac as well and have shifted to our own chips there. And so, it really depends on whether we see a way to do something that\u2019s differentiated or not. And I wouldn\u2019t want to rule anything out. It\u2019s more of whether or not we see our way clear to doing something that is materially better. We feel like we\u2019ve done that in the chip area.\nHarsh Kumar: And then, I\u2019ve got one for Luca. I want to go back to a question that Amit asked earlier in the call about the gross margin. So, when I look at the September quarter, services obviously grew much faster than the product business, margin was down and same thing for December. But I think you\u2019re effectively saying that there\u2019s a lot of new product launches. Would that not go into OpEx, for example, marketing, et cetera, as opposed to COGS, or is there something that maybe needs to be clarified here?\nLuca Maestri: There is -- certainly, obviously, that we have launch expenses in marketing and advertising, of course, when we launch new products. But, the reality, what happens, we always make our products better and which means adding new technology and new features to the product. So, typically, when you move from one generation of products to the next one, the cost structures tend to be higher, particularly at the beginning of the cycle. And so, when you make that transition, there is always some level of margin compression from the transition to a new product. The other aspect that you need to think about is the fact that the December quarter is the holiday season, and so the percentage of products business that we have in the holiday quarter is higher than what we have in the September quarter, for example. And therefore, as you know, because the services margins are higher than the products margin. There\u2019s also a mix between the products and services business that plays into the gross margins for the Company, right? And that\u2019s what you see as you move sequentially from September to December.\nOperator: We\u2019ll hear next from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: I had a question about -- broadly about pricing of new products. This year, Apple launched the iPhone 13 at a slightly lower price than where the 12 was launched last year in China. Can you maybe help us think through what are some of the things that you look at in deciding that? And is that an action that you could take more broadly in other regions? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: We look at a variety of things, including our costs, including competition, including local conditions and exchange rates and a number of different things. And so, there\u2019s not a -- there\u2019s no formula for determining it. It\u2019s done by a level of judgment looking at a number of different points -- data points. And we do that region by region.\nWamsi Mohan: But, we shouldn\u2019t, as investors, think of that as something structural that you intend to use to flex demand curves more globally?\nTim Cook: It\u2019s something we\u2019ve always done. And so, it\u2019s not something that is new to this year and this cycle.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. And as a follow-up, you\u2019ve introduced a lot of new services over the past few years, and these have become a much more important part of the Apple story. Can you maybe share either some metrics on some of the new Services like TV+ in terms of paid subs? And how are you measuring the success of these investments?\nTim Cook: Well, we look at a number of things internally that we don\u2019t share externally. And so, you can bet that we\u2019re looking at subs and ARPUs and conversions and churn and all of the normal things you would look at with a subscription business. But, we\u2019re not going to get into sharing those on an individual service basis. What we\u2019re trying to do is give you visibility to the aggregate number of subscriptions that we\u2019ve had, which Luca covered earlier with the 745 million across both Apple branded and third party. And so, we\u2019re giving you an aggregated view of it instead of the -- at the individual service level. But, you can bet that we\u2019re managing it at the individual service level.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Wamsi.

I'd like now to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Today, Apple is reporting a very strong quarter with double digit revenue growth across our product and services categories, and in every geographic segment. We set a new June quarter revenue record of $81.4 billion, up 36% from last year, and the vast majority of markets we tracked grew double digits, with especially strong growth in emerging markets including India, Latin America, and Vietnam. Total retail sales also set a June quarter record, and almost all of our retail stores have now opened their doors. This quarter saw a growing sense of optimism from consumers in the United States and around the world, driving renewed hope for a better future and for all that innovation can make possible. But as the last 18-months had demonstrated many times before, progress made is not progress guaranteed. An uneven recovery to the pandemic and a Delta variant surging in many countries around the world have shown us once again, that the road to recovery will be a winding one. In the midst of that enduring adversity, we are especially humbled that our technology has continued to play a key role in keeping our customers connected. Just last month, it was great to be back with our teams and customers for the opening of our newest retail store in Los Angeles, our Apple Tower Theater. It was a hopeful reminder of the energy and sense of community, shared spaces bring and how appreciative we all are now of the simple privilege of talking to one another face to face. As we look forward to more in-person interactions in the future, we're doubling down on innovation, and doing all we can to help chart a course to a healthier and more equitable world. I'll have more to say about our work in those areas a bit later on. But first, let's turn to our product and services categories. For iPhone, this quarter saw very strong double digit growth in each geographic segment, and we continue to be heartened by our customer's response to the iPhone 12 lineup. We're only in the early innings of 5G, but already its incredible performance and speed have made a significant impact on how people can get the most out of our technology. Customers love iPhone 12 for its superfast 5G speeds, A14 Bionic chip and Adobe vision camera never seen before in a phone. Users continue to rely on iPad and Mac to work, learn, create and connect. iPad had its highest June quarter in nearly a decade, while Mac set an all-time June quarter record. We've seen a great response to the new iMac and iPad Pro, both powered by the M1 chips exceptional speed and power efficient performance. The iMac\u2019s remarkable thin design and vibrant colors have made it a favorite for users everywhere. And the iPad continues to be an incredibly versatile tool in our user's toolbox, inspiring creativity and connection and keeping us entertained and productive in equal measure. It was another very strong quarter for wearables, home and accessories, which set a new June quarter record, while helping people find more ways to stay entertained, healthy and connected at home and on the go. Apple Watch remains a go to choice for users to stay on top of their health and reach their fitness goals. And our newest accessory AirTag began shipping to an enthusiastic response from customers, making the find my network more useful than ever, while protecting user privacy. Turning to services, which set a new all-time revenue record as we continue to roll out innovative new features and programming. We're proud to be the recipients of 35 Emmy Nominations this year, which speaks to the quality of our programming, and an enthusiastic reception from customers and critics alike. Apple TV+ users are loving series like Mythic Quest, and anticipating groundbreaking films like Coda, which premieres next month. And of course, Ted Lasso kicked off season two just last week, and continues to win over viewers with its heartwarming message about the power of community, compassion and hope. We also introduced Apple Podcast subscriptions, a global marketplace for users to discover exclusive content and support their favorite creators. And we launched spatial audio for Apple Music, a cinematic listening experience that promises to change how music fans listen, and musicians create even more immersive, layered, and beautiful songs. Last month, we shared many exciting new features at WWDC. But more powerful than any of them was the incredible showing of developers from all walks of life and around the world. The new tools we announced will help developers harness cutting edge technologies, like augmented reality, reach new users and customize their experience on the App Store, or learn to update or invent an app with Swift, Apple's powerful and intuitive programming language. Today's investments in education and coding translate to tomorrow's small businesses and groundbreaking new apps. The next act of an app economy, already creating jobs and opportunity around the world. In June, a new study by the analysis group found that it was another record year for App Store developers, whose combined billings and sales increased by 24% to $643 billion in 2020. The app economy continues to be an incredible engine of prosperity and opportunity, fueled by the ceaseless striving for developers to make apps that enrich people's lives. Much like the developer community, we are diehard optimist, about technology's potential to help people live happier, healthier and more fulfilled lives, goals that shine through with powerful new updates coming to iOS, iPad OS, Mac OS, and Watch OS this fall. That begins with innovative new features that help users stay connected with one another, like share play and spatial audio for FaceTime, or disconnect when they need a break like focus, which limits distracting notifications when you're winding down for bed or concentrating at work. And new productivity features make iPad an even more useful tool for multitasking, helping users navigate across apps, split their screen or use quick note to capture a thought the moment inspiration strikes. In the health space, our new health sharing feature will make it easier than ever to securely share your health data to share your health data with loved ones. That includes new capabilities like walking steadiness, which uses sensors to assess user stability doing everyday tasks, and recommends exercises to improve stability and avoid a fall. In the belief that privacy is a fundamental human right, we share new features in iOS 15 that continue to drive our progress forward, from mail privacy protection, which stops invisible pixels and an email from tracking your mail activity to App Privacy Report, which helps users check on the apps they've granted permission to use their personal data. We also introduced some incredible next generation technologies coming to the accessibility space. From assistive touch, which helps people with limb differences navigate Apple Watch to new voiceover capabilities to help blind and low vision users, accessibility remains a bedrock principle for us, in the simple belief that the best technology for the world should be the best technology for everyone. But the responsibility to be a force for good in the lives of others extends beyond the technology we made, so the teachers and students shaping our future. This quarter as part of our racial equity and justice initiative, we awarded innovation grants to engineering schools at four historically black colleges and universities to expand their coursework, scholarships and internship opportunities in hardware engineering and silicon chip design. We see education as a great equalizing force, and we're more dedicated than ever to supporting the educators, advocates and students lining the path and leading the way. That includes the 350 swift student challenge winners, we recognized at this year's WWDC. If you ever need a dose of hope or inspiration, I can't say enough about our students' scholarship winners, whose apps bring so much good into the world, from teaching other young people to code to helping volunteers deliver groceries to people at high risk of COVID-19. Young people's innovations remind us that our collective future is bound up in the next generations' passion for solving global challenges, and of the responsibility we have to join them in building a better world. Turning to our own backyard, we're continuing to press forward in our efforts to help bring more affordable housing to the Bay Area and across California. This month, we shared that we've contributed more than $1 billion to help first time homeowners and construct 1000s of new affordable housing units across the state. And we're continuing to stay focused on supporting the global response to the pandemic and delivering the best products and services for people. Our greatest source of inspiration is a technology itself, but how people use it in their own lives, in ways great and small, to write a novel or to read one, to care for an ailing patient or see a doctor virtually, to track their heart rate on a jog or to train for the Olympics. Every day, I'm grateful for the dedication of our teams to the simple mission of creating technology that improves people's lives. And I want to thank everyone at Apple for the purpose and passion they bring to that mission. With that, I'll hand it over to Luca for a deeper dive on our performance this quarter.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to report record June quarter financial results, which reflect the importance of our products and services in our customers lives and our strong underlying operating performance. Our revenue reached a June quarter record of $81.4 billion, an increase of nearly $22 billion or 36% from a year ago. We grew double digits in each of our product categories, with an all-time record for services, and June quarter records for iPhone, Mac, and Wearables, Home and Accessories. We also set new June quarter records in every geographic segment with very strong double digit growth in each one of them. Products revenue was a June quarter record of $63.9 billion, up 37% over a year ago. This level of sales performance, combined with the unmatched loyalty of our customers drove our installed base of active devices to a new all-time record. Our services set an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion up 33% over a year ago, with June quarter records in each geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.3%, up 80 basis points from last quarter driven by cost savings and a higher mix of services, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 36% down 10 basis points sequentially, a seasonal loss of leverage was almost entirely offset by cost savings. Services gross margin was 69.8% down 30 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $21.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.30, and operating cash flow of $21.1 billion were all June quarter records by a wide margin. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a June quarter record of $39.6 billion growing 50% year-over-year and exceeding our own expectations, as the iPhone 12 family continued to be in very high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world, and we grew very strong double digits in each geographic segment, setting June quarter records in most markets we track. Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and the strength of our ecosystem. In the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 97% for the iPhone 12 family. Turning to services, as I mentioned, we reach an all-time revenue record of $17.5 billion with all-time records for cloud services, music, video, advertising and payment services, and June quarter records for the App Store and Apple Care. Our newest service offerings Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content and features and are contributing to overall services growth. The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction. First, our installed base of devices reached an all-time high across each geographic segment. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the June quarter in each geographic segment, and paid accounts increased double digits. Third, paid subscriptions continue to show strong growth. We now have more than 700 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 150 million from last year, and nearly four times the number of paid subscriptions we had only four years ago. And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings. For example, during WWDC in June, we previewed our new iCloud+, and Apple Wallet features, which we believe will create a more secure and differentiated customer experience. Wearables, home and accessories grew 36% year-over-year to $8.8 billion, setting new June quarter revenue records in every geographic segment. We continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category. This quarter, we began shipping our new Apple TV 4K with a redesign Siri remote and our brand new air tags, and the customer response to both products has been very strong. In addition to its outstanding sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. For Mac, despite supply constraints, we set a June quarter record of $8.2 billion up 16% over last year, with June quarter revenue records in most markets we track around the world. It is remarkable that the last four quarters for Mac have been its best four quarters ever. This exceptional level of sales success has been driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs, powered by the M1 chip, which we most recently brought to our newly redesigned iMac. iPad performance was also strong with revenue of $7.4 billion up 12% in spite of significant supply constraints. During the quarter we also started shipping our new iPad Pro powered by the M1 chip and customer response has been outstanding. Both iPad and Mac have taken computing to the next level, and when you combine their performance over the last 12-months, they're now the size of a Fortune-50 business, thanks to the best product lineups we've ever had, very high levels of customer satisfaction and a loyal growing installed base. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter were new to that product. And in most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 research customer satisfaction was 92% for Mac and 95% for iPad. In enterprise, our customers are excited about the superior performance, battery life and security that the new M1 Macs bring. MassMutual for example, is offering M1 MacBook Pro to all of its employees and equipping all conference rooms with M1 Mac minis in preparation for return to work. And with its incredible performance and affordable entry price, the MacBook Air with M1 is gaining rapid adoption among many leading enterprise organizations. Italgas, Italy's largest natural gas company, which will soon be using its extensive network to distribute renewable gases is replacing every employee's Windows laptop with the new MacBook Air powered by Apple's M1 chip to bring the latest technology to its workforce. And Grab, Southeast Asia's leading super app that provides transportation, food delivery and digital payment services is adding M1 MacBook Air to its company-wide M1 Mac deployment. Let me now turn to our cash position, we ended the quarter with $194 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We retired $3 billion of term debt and increased commercial paper by $3 billion, leaving us with total debt of $122 billion. As a result, net cash was $72 billion at the end of the quarter. As our business continued to perform at a very high level, we were also able to return $29 billion to shareholders during the June quarter. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalence, and $17.5 billion through open market repurchases of 136 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in May, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 32 million shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near-term, we're not providing revenue guidance. But we are sharing some directional insights, assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we're projecting today for the current quarter. We expect very strong double digit year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. We expect revenue growth to be lower than our June quarter year-over-year growth of 36% for three reasons. First, we expect the foreign exchange impact on our year-over-year growth rate to be three points less favorable than it was during the June quarter. Second, we expect our services growth rate to return to a more typical level. The growth rate during the June quarter benefited from a favorable compare, as certain services were significantly impacted by the COVID lockdowns a year ago. And third, we expect supply constraints during the September quarter to be greater than what we experienced during the June quarter. The constraints will primarily impact iPhone and iPad. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect our OpEx to be between $11.3 billion and $11.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around zero, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividends with $0.22 per share of common stock payable on August 12, 2021, to shareholders of record as of August 9, 2021. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Katy, your line is open. Please check your mute function. We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChris Caso: Thank you. Good morning. Just dig into the commentary on guidance a little bit. Just starting with the fact that last year, obviously there was a later launch of iPhone than what was typically seen in other years. Could you talk us through that, and perhaps some of the other products, what may be different as compared to last year?\nLuca Maestri: Well, as I explained that, first of all, we are expecting to grow very strong double digits, that's I think Chris the starting point here. We expect this very strong level of growth that we've experienced during the course of the year, to continue into the September quarter. We said that the growth rate is going to be below 36%. And I've listed three factors. The first factor is that the dollar continues to be favorable on a year-over-year basis in the sense that it's weakened against most currencies on a year-over-year basis. But that benefit is going to be about three points less in the September quarter than what we've experienced during the June quarter, because the dollar strengthened against most currencies in recent weeks. Second, I mentioned that the services growth rate that we've experienced in the June quarter 33%, that's significantly higher than what we've had in recent history. And that was due to the fact that there were a couple of services categories, namely, our advertising business and Apple Care, that were significantly impacted a year ago, because of the COVID lock downs. And therefore, they're relatively easy compare in the June quarter. So we don't expect that to continue into the September quarter. And so we expect to see significant growth in services, but not to the level that we've seen in June. And then I mentioned that the supply constraints that we've seen in the June quarter will be higher during the September quarter. Back in when we talked here three months ago, we said that we were expecting supply constraints for the June quarter between $3 billion and $4 billion, to affect primarily iPad and Mac. We were able to mitigate some of those constraints during the June quarter, and so we came in at a number that was slightly below the low-end of that range that we accorded at the beginning of the quarter. But we expect that number to be higher for the September quarter. And so when you put all that together, again, very strong double digit growth for September, with this caveat, that I just mentioned.\nChris Caso: Thank you. If I could follow-up with regard to the supply constraints, and do you expect those supply constraints to persist through the December quarter as well? What effect will that have on the holiday selling season? And then, in conjunction with that, what additional costs are you absorbing because of the supply constraints? Is that having an effect on gross margins or just product costs in general, as you perhaps pay a little more to get more supply?\nTim Cook: Chris, it's Tim. In terms of the cost, we're paying more for freight than I would like to pay. But component costs continue in the aggregate to decline. In terms of supply constraints, and how long they will last, I don't want to predict that today. We're going to take it sort of one quarter at a time. And as you would guess we'll do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances were dealt.\nLuca Maestri: And Chris, on the cost side, as I mentioned during my comments, our results for gross margins for the June quarter 43.3%, we really saw some really nice cost savings during the quarter. And I think you've seen that we provided guidance for 41.5% to 42.5% for September, which is obviously a level that we are very pleased with.\nChris Caso: Right. Thank you.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Chris. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research. Please go ahead.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much, and congratulations to you and your global team for great operations during a challenging time. Tim and Luca, I just have one question and either of you or both of you could figure out who's best to answer it. But we look at a world of pretty unprecedented whether it be COVID, the Delta variant, China floods, supply chain, components. Just wondering for your, like R&D and innovation, is it being materially impacted by that such where a normal cadence is unfair? Or, is it kind of happening during a slow time of year where you're able to empower people to work remotely, and still have the typical innovations and product launches that you've had historically in the past?\nTim Cook: Jim, the company has been incredibly resilient. The employees are really doing double duty. And I could not be more pleased with the cadence that we're coming out with new things. As you can see from the software announcements that we made at WWDC, and the corresponding launches of the software that we plan on in the fall, and then all of the products that we've been able to bring out over the last 12 to 18-months, it's amazing. So I'm very pleased with it.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Jim. Can we please the next question please?\nJim Suva: Thank you. Congratulations again.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much, Tim, I'm curious, what have you learned from this iPhone cycle regarding customer preferences and pricing and maybe subscriptions and that? And if there's a difference, if you could talk about on a geographic basis. Thanks.\nTim Cook: If you look at our results in Q3, Shannon, we had strong double digit growth for switchers and for upgraders. And, in fact, it was our largest upgrade quarter for Q3 ever. And so we feel really, really great about both categories. And as Luca kind of said, during the preamble or opening comments, our results are really strong for iPhone around the world. And so it's been a very, very strong cycle. And yet we're -- the penetration on 5G is obviously still very, very low. And so we feel really good about the future of the iPhone.\nShannon Cross: Okay. And maybe if you can talk a bit about China, up 58%, where are you seeing the growth? What are you hearing from customers there? Obviously 58% is not sustainable, but how sustainable is the strength? Thank you.\nTim Cook: It was an incredibly strong quarter, it set a June quarter revenue record for Greater China for us. And so we're very proud of that. And, doing the best job we can to serve customers there. We had a particularly strong response to the 12 Pro and the 12 Pro Max. Those results were particularly strong. But if you look at the balance of our products, we also set June quarter records for Wearables, Home and Accessories, for Mac and for services. So it was sort of an across the board strength. And we're seeing plenty of new customers come to the market. For example, Mac and iPad, about two-thirds of the customers who bought in the last quarter were new to that product. For the Apple Watch that number was 85%. And so, we could not be happier with the results.\nShannon Cross: Was 85% China or overall?\nTim Cook: 85% was China. I was talking about specifically the numbers of reference were specifically for China.\nLuca Maestri: And Shannon, for the world with the Watch is 75%.\nShannon Cross: Right. Great. Thank you so much.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thanks a lot for taking my question, I have two, as well. I guess first off Luca, I was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the gross margins and maybe the expectations you laid out for September, I think sequentially implies down 100 basis points or so. So can you just touch on what are the puts and takes that would be helpful, because I think historically, September tends to be a flattish maybe even up a little bit gross margin number for you folks?\nLuca Maestri: Yeah, I think it's important to go back to the Q3 results, it's 43.3%. And one of the things that I mentioned is that in addition to getting really good cost savings on a sequential basis, we also had a very high mix of services as part of the total. And particularly with advertising doing really, really well, because of the rebound that we saw from COVID lockdowns a year ago. So as we move forward sequentially, we do expect a different mix and so that that drives the guidance that we provided which again, as you know, is significantly higher than just a year ago, for example. A year ago, we were at 38.2%, so almost 400 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis. And so, I think it's important to take that into account, just a different mix.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. No, absolutely. I don't think anyone expected gross margins to be north of 40 this quickly for you folks. So that is impressive. As a follow-up on services, and I know you've called out the 33% growth this quarter, as a bit of an aberration that compares easier. But if you look at your services growth rate over the last four quarters, let's just say, what do you think is enabling this growth? Is it you're able to have a higher ARPU more monetization of the installed base? Or, is the installed base growing and choose which one's bigger? And then over time, how do you think those two components stack up for you?\nLuca Maestri: It's a combination of multiple factors. Obviously, the fact that our installed base continues to grow, and it sets new all-time highs all the time, obviously, it gives us a larger opportunity all the time. And second, we have more and more people that are engaged in our ecosystem, both transacting for free, which is a very large number, and people that are willing to pay for some of the services. And that percentage of people that are paying for our services continues to grow nicely. I mentioned, we grew double digits again this quarter. So that obviously helps on the revenue side. And of course, we continue to increase both the quality and the quantity of the services. As you know, during the last few years, we've launched a lot of new services from Apple TV+, Fitness+, Apple Arcade, News+, of course, the Apple Card. And so these are businesses that we are scaling right now, and so all that additional revenue helps. And I think it flows through our growth rates, as you said, during the last four quarters we are well into the mid-20s. So I think it's obviously very nice for us to see.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, we can.\nKaty Huberty: Okay, good. So first question, there's a debate in the market around how much Apple benefited from the pandemic, given increased spend in areas like Mac and App Store. But of course, you've mentioned over the past several quarters that there are other areas that were limited by the pandemic, and store closures and less foot traffic. When you net out all the puts and takes was your business helped? Or, was it hindered by the pandemic?\nLuca Maestri: Well, of course, Katy, we don't have the crystal ball that tells us exactly what these different variables, how they impacted our business. We do know that I would say on the positive side of the ledger, obviously, especially during the periods of extreme lockdowns, digital services did very well because entertainment options were limited. And so obviously, our digital services did really, really well. Obviously with more people working from home, more people studying from home, we know that iPad and Mac demand was very, very strong. On the other side we add certain services like advertising because of the reduced economic activity, Apple Care because our stores were closed, they were affected negatively. And certain products like the iPhone or the Watch that are may be more complex types of sales because of the complexity of the transaction. They were also affected because so many points of sale were closed all around the world, not only our stores but also our partner stores. It\u2019s difficult for us to gauge because we've been constrained for quite a long period of time. And the reality is that maybe the new normal after we exit COVID may be different from the past. For example, maybe there's going to be hybrid models around work, for example. And so, it's difficult to tell you on a net basis what that is. Clearly, and this is very fluid because it tends to change over time. I can certainly tell you that we're all looking forward to a COVID free world, I think that would be very good for us and for our customers as well.\nKaty Huberty: And just to follow-up on iPhones, specifically, if you look historically, after a really strong product cycle, which you've experienced this year with iPhone 12. iPhone revenues come under pressure, because the upgrade rate slows, the mix often shifts to the lower end of the portfolio. Is it fair to assume a similar trend will play out over the next year? Or if not, time\u2026 [ph] \nTim Cook: Katy, it's Tim. We're not predicting the next cycle. But I would point out a few things. One is we have a very large and growing installed base. As you know with the iPhones passed a billion active devices earlier this year. Two, we have loyal and satisfied customers. The customer set we're seeing on the new iPhones are just amazing. It's just jaw dropping. And the geographic response is pervasive across the world. In the U.S., we have the top three selling models. In the UK, we have four out of the top five. In Australia, we have the top two. In Japan, we have the top three. In urban China, we have the top two. And so the response from customers all around had been great. Obviously, the product itself is amazing. The 12 lineup was a huge leap that introduced 5G and have A14 Bionic and a number of other fantastic features that customers love. The next thing I think to consider is that we're in the very early innings of 5G. If you look at our 5G penetration around the world there's only a couple of countries that are in the double digits yet. And so that's an amazing thing, nine months or so into this. And the last thing is we're going to continue to deliver great products. We're going to continue to do what we do best is integrate hardware, software and services together into an amazing experience. And so those are the things that I would consider if I were coming up with forecast.\nKaty Huberty: That's great color. Thank you.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, guys, first of all, congratulations, fantastic execution that resulted in consistency for your results. Tim, this is actually perfect timing for this question. You talked about your installed base of a billion odd units. I was curious if you could help us understand how all of that installed base is? And the reason that I'm asking this question is we're clearly seeing people upgrade to 5G phones. That's the case and that continues, that could be a larger force than most other forces for your revenues to continue to grow as people migrate to the 5G family of phones. So I was curious, if you can shed light on how the upgrades are happening and then also, how old that base is?\nTim Cook: Yeah, what I would tell you is first of all, it's difficult to answer your question precisely. But what I would tell you is on both switchers and upgraders, we did extremely well in Q3. Both were up strong double digit, and the geographic representation of iPhone year-over-year comps looks extremely well. And so we're really pleased with it. I would remind you that the billion number that I quoted also was iPhone, where we quoted a number earlier in the year in the January call, I believe, of 1.65 billion devices is the total active devices just for clarification. And so the net is very strong switchers, very strong upgraders, best upgrade quarter for the June quarter that we've seen. And we feel really great about the momentum. But at the same time, we recognize that the 5G penetration is quite low around the world. And, they're very, very low. We're at the front end of this.\nHarsh Kumar: Fair enough. For my follow-up, Apple's probably one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world. How does Apple determine what's strategic, and something that Apple wants to make itself versus non-strategic? And also was curious, there's a lot of -- well, it's public news now the Arm is getting acquired by Nvidia. And I was just curious how Apple views that? Is that something that's beneficial to Apple or not meaningful or negative?\nTim Cook: I think that acquisition has lots of questions that people are asking, and I'll sort of leave that up to everyone else. And in terms of us and how we decide to make silicon, we ask ourselves, if we can do something better, if we can deliver a better product, if we can buy something in the market. And it's great, and it's as good as what we could do, we're going to buy it. We will only enter where we believe we have a ability to do something better, and therefore make a better product for the user. And so the M1 is a great example of that. We have the ability within our silicon team to deliver product that we feel is appreciably better than we could buy. And so, we've taken our great hardware and software expertise, and combine those and have brought the M1 out. And the response to the M1 has been unbelievable. It's powering Mac sales that are constrained, it's powering now iPad, which also has constraints on it. And so, that's how we look at whether we should enter into a market or not.\nHarsh Kumar: Thank you.\nTim Cook: Thanks for the question.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Certainly, we will take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong results. First one for Luca, you mentioned services growth should normalize in the September quarter. And I understand the last few quarters' services business was strong, driven by work from home, et cetera. So what is the normalized growth rate for the services business as folks return back to the office in this post-COVID world? And then I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Well, I think, you can go back several quarters and try to do a bit of an average and that's what we were talking about. Of course, there's always a bit of variability around results, right. But certainly, we haven't done 33% in years and so that was a bit of an anomaly. And again, I explained it's around a couple of the businesses that had a relatively easy compare during the June quarter. So our services growth has been for many, many quarters in strong double digits and we feel confident around that level.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. And then just a follow-up for Tim or Luca. I think, Tim, you mentioned in your prepared comments that in September quarter, there's going to be greater impact on supply constraints on the iPhone and iPad. So I'm kind of curious, this is the first time I heard you talk about component shortages impacting the iPhone. Can you be more specific? Is it display drivers? Or, what exactly is the choke point on the supply?\nTim Cook: The majority of constraints we're seeing are of the variety that I think others are saying that are I would classify as industry shortage. We do have some shortages, in addition to that, that are where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. So it's a little bit of that as well. As I said before, I think probably maybe with the basis of your question, sort of the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been on the silicon.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll hear the next question from David Vogt with UBS.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you guys for the question. So maybe just a point of clarification. So based on the data and the comments about upgraders and switchers being strong, as well as emerging markets were relatively strong in the quarter. What does that specific set of data points strength mean for the iPhone portfolio? And I guess my question around that is, when you think about switchers and price points, I think last year, you launched the SE2 to really address maybe some of the lower price point markets like the emerging markets. So does that mean thinking about the portfolio going forward, there's less of a need for a lower priced product going forward, and the current portfolio and the new cycle going forward would be more high-end in nature, as we currently have today? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: David, we had an incredible quarter for the emerging markets in Q3. We set June quarter records in Mexico, and Brazil, and Chile, in Turkey, and UAE, and Poland and Czech Republic, India. Obviously, in China, as I've talked about before, Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, I could go on in the name a few more, it's a very long list. And so those results are for the entire line of products that we have. And keep in mind, we still do have SE in the line, we launched it a year ago, but it's still in the line today. And it\u2019s sort of our entry price point. And so, I'm pleased with how all of them are doing. And I think we need to sort of that range of price points to accommodate the types of people that we want to accommodate. So we've put something for the entry buyer who really wants to get into an iPhone, and then something for the pro buyer who wants the very best iPhone that they can buy. And I think that's true in the emerging markets as good as it's true in the United States or other developed markets.\nDavid Vogt: No, that's helpful. I appreciate that, Tim. So does that mean sort of the emerging market buyer that wants to get into the iPhone is looking for a device that has 5G capability as well? Obviously, we're early innings in a lot of markets, or how do we think about that over the intermediate to longer-term in terms of consumer preference for 5G in those markets, if available from an infrastructure perspective?\nTim Cook: In most of the markets I read, it is really, really, really early on 5G, really early. But I think the top end buyer is buying for the future as well, because they may hold their phone for two years or longer in some cases. So, 5G becomes an important part of their buying decision.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you very much.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research Company.\nBen Bollin: Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start Luca or Tim, could you walk us through a little bit about how you think Apple One bundles are influencing the trajectory of services and the economics? And then a second part on services, I'm curious how you think IDFA is developing and influencing the trajectory of the advertising business within services?\nTim Cook: In terms of Apple One as you know, we're offering Apple One because it makes enjoying our subscription services easier than ever before, including Apple Music and Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade and iCloud and more. And so we really put the customer at the center of that and have recently began to remind people about Apple One in a way that we probably waited a few months before doing that. And so, I'm very pleased with what we're seeing on Apple One right now. I think it's a great ramp for the future services. And more importantly, it's a great customer benefit because many of our customers like to try out more than one of these services, and it allows them to do that with one easy bundle and subscription service. In terms of IDFA or the advertising in general, I take it your question is around ATT. With ATT we've been getting quite a bit of customer positive reaction to being able to make the decision on a transparent basis about whether to be tracked or not. And it seems to be going very well from a user point of view.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Can we have a question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you, I have two as well. To begin with Luca, you noted significant product revenue deleverage but yet your product gross margins were roughly flat, you know that cost savings. Can you maybe talk about whether these are tactical in nature, or more structural like vertical integration that will continue to drive benefits to product gross margins? And on services side, you noted several times about the strength in ad growth, which is obviously very high margin contributor, but the sequential trajectory on services margins was flat. So what were some of the offsets there? And I\u2019ve a follow-up for Tim.\nLuca Maestri: Yeah. On the product side, I talked about cost savings. Tim mentioned that, maybe on the freight side, we're seeing some level of cost pressure that is a bit out of the norm, at this point in the cycle. For everything else, for all the major commodities and components, we continue to see a very typical cycle where we are getting good cost savings on a sequential basis. And so far, it's been very good as you can tell from the absolute level of gross margins, because on the product side, we're up more than 600 basis points on a year-over-year basis. So it feels something that we've been able to accomplish, and we were able to maintain, at least in the near-term, nothing that was abnormal during the quarter or a one-off in nature. It was pretty structural. On the services side, again, up a lot on a year-over-year basis. So, the baseline has gone up a lot. The sequential decline, as you said, it was very, very small. And as I mentioned several times in the past, we have a very large services portfolio with very different margin profiles in our services. And so even a slight change in mix can drive some sequential differences, and this was the case this quarter, just a different mix. I mentioned for example, that Apple Care has rebounded. And so the relative success of our services in the marketplace can drive some slight changes in gross margins. Again, step back for a second, 69.8% gross margin we're very, very happy with where we are with the services margin trajectory.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Luca. And Tim, there is increasing regulatory focus in China in particular on some of the Chinese companies. It's not a direct impact of Apple, but how should investors handicap the indirect impact, given some of these companies are pretty large contributors to Apple's App Store revenues? And also, is there -- are you seeing any impact at all from these? And is the limiting of the usage of some of these apps influencing how people are either interacting with your devices, or is there any other ancillary impact that you're seeing? Thank you.\nTim Cook: For the quarter, as you can see we grew 58% so it was a strong quarter. And embedded in that was a quarterly record for services, which includes the App Store world. So, we're seeing strength in China. The economy has really bounced back there fairly quickly from COVID. In terms of the regulatory focus, what we are focusing on from our angle is to serve users there and make sure that they're very satisfied with the products and services that we\u2019re showing. And we work with a lot of different companies to ensure that. So that's our focus.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Wamsi.

I'd now like to turn over the call to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. Apple is proud to report another strong quarter, one where we set new March quarter records for both revenue and earnings, besting our year ago revenue performance by 54%. Reflecting both the enduring ways our products have helped our users meet this moment in their own lives as well as the optimism consumers seem to feel about better days ahead, we set new March quarter records in every geographic segment, and success was broadly distributed across our product categories. Mac and Services delivered all-time record results, and we set new March quarter records for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories. To provide some color on our results, let's turn to our product categories. We saw a very strong performance for iPhone, which grew 66% year-over-year driven by the strong popularity of the iPhone 12 family. With unmatched 5G capability, the best camera system ever in an iPhone and advanced durability from ceramic shield, this family of devices is popular with both upgraders and new customers alike. And just last week, we unveiled an all-new purple finish for iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. As has been the case throughout the pandemic, iPad and Mac continue to be critically important tools for our customers. Over the past year, tens of millions of iPads and Macs have been deployed to help students learn, creators create, and to enhance remote work in all of its forms. This has helped iPad grow very strong double digits to its highest March quarter revenue in nearly a decade. On Mac, fueled by the M1, we set an all-time revenue record continuing the momentum for the product category. In fact, the last three quarters for Mac have been its three best quarters ever. Last week, both iPad and Mac took a big step forward. We debuted a radically redesigned brand-new iMac designed around M1's unmatched capabilities, and we've brought M1 to iPad for the first time in the new iPad Pro with 5G capability and a Liquid Retina XDR display. It was a quarter of sustained strength for Wearables, Home and Accessories, which grew by 25% year-over-year. Apple Watch is a global success story, and the category set March quarter records in each geographic segment, thanks to strong performance from both Apple Watch Series 6 and Apple Watch SE. It's an exciting and busy period ahead for Wearables, Home and Accessories with the launch of the next-generation Apple TV 4K and our newest accessory, AirTag. AirTag builds on the powerful and incredibly useful Find My experience, helping users privately and securely keep track of the items that matter most to them. Third-party accessories and products can also make use of the Find My network guaranteeing a great experience no matter what products you choose to use. Turning to Services. We achieved growth of 27% year-over-year and set new records for services in each of our geographic segments. We continue to enhance and improve our current service offerings from Apple Music to Apple News while continuing to launch new services that enhance our customers' lives. Just last week, we introduced Apple Card family which reinvents how you can share credit cards and build credit together. We also announced Apple Podcast subscriptions, a global marketplace for listeners to discover premium content from their favorite creators and storytellers. While we're on the topic of services, in many ways, this quarter showed the unique value to customers created by Apple's belief in the deep integration of hardware, software, and services. Across our products and throughout our software ecosystem, we continue to deploy industry-leading new tools to protect users' fundamental right to privacy. In addition to the App Store privacy nutrition labels that we discussed on last quarter's call, we're proud to have launched the full implementation of App Tracking Transparency. This powerful, yet simple idea gives users a choice over how their data is used and shared across the apps that they love and use every day. No matter what device you enjoy it from, it is a milestone period for Apple TV+, racking up many new award nominations and wins, including its first Oscar nominations. Ted Lasso, in particular, has been recognized with a multitude of awards and nominations including most recently, an AFI Program of the Year Recognition, Writers Guild of America Awards, and a clean sweep at the Critics Choice Awards. Apple TV+ also continues to be a place where we can tell stories that matter and lift up important voices and experiences like our new upcoming content partnership with Malala, our latest original documentary special The Year the Earth Changed narrated by the legendary David Attenborough and released to commemorate Earth Day. This is, of course, just one example of how Apple lives its values and operationalizes the idea that to whom much is given, much is expected. To begin with our environmental efforts, just last week, we marked a milestone Earth Day on multiple fronts. In addition to the progress we've made in our own efforts to achieve our pledge of a net zero carbon footprint by 2030 across our entire supply chain and use of our products, we're proud to play a role in the growing ripple change taking place across the private sector. As of this month, 110 of our suppliers have joined us in our renewable energy commitment, and we will bring online nearly 8 gigawatts of new clean energy, the equivalent of taking 3.4 million gas-powered vehicles off the road each year. Through Apple's $4.7 billion in green bonds and related efforts, we've supported transformative environmental projects around the world from clean energy initiatives in China to two of the world's largest onshore wind turbines in Denmark to 180-acre solar project outside Reno, Nevada and many more. We're also keenly focused on how this wave of green innovation can lead to equitably shared prosperity. Through our new $200 million Restore Fund, we're helping local and rural communities around the world build sustainable industries around working for us creating opportunities and removing up to 1 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year. And here in the United States, we started a green impact accelerator, investing and supporting minority-owned businesses at the forefront of environmental fields. As we look forward to WWDC, we're taking new steps to support and foster the unmatched community of developers we work with here in the United States and around the world. I'm particularly excited about our inaugural Entrepreneur Camp for black founders and developers. Building on the success of our Entrepreneur Camp program, which we began in 2019, this program gives this profoundly innovative community of developers the chance to develop next-level technical skills through hands-on technology labs, and with our partners at Harlem Capital, it also shares insights and mentorship on building and scaling an app business. We were proud to announce that we have expanded and accelerated our commitment to the U.S. economy. Over the next five years, we will invest $430 billion, creating 20,000 jobs in the process. The investments will support American innovation and drive economic benefits in every state, including a new North Carolina campus and job creating investments in innovative fields like silicon engineering and 5G technology. Looking forward, whether you're running a business or just hoping to see family again after more than a year, it's tempting at this moment to let hope about the end of the COVID-19 pandemic outstripped clear-eyed realism about the challenges we still face. In many places around the world, new waves of infections driven by even more infectious variants of the virus are driving new lockdowns. Instead of simply assuming that the end is in sight, we at Apple are doing our part to make it a reality. Beginning with an enduring and uncompromising commitment to the health and safety of our teams, and extending well beyond our walls into the communities where we work. We also want to do everything we can to connect users to life-saving vaccinations that are in ever greater supply. Through Apple Maps, for example, we now showcase vaccine site locations here in the United States, building on our maps of testing locations in many countries around the world. It's worth remembering for much more than financial reasons or year-ago compares, just how we felt at this time last year when everything we knew had to change. Plains set grounded, entire business districts were empty and silent. People left groceries or care packages sitting in the garage or in the hall overnight in recognition of all that we didn't know and therefore, had to imagine. Thanks to researchers and scientists, doctors and nurses, everyone who can put a shot in an arm and even just check a name off a list. We have reached new days of hopeful resolve. Our work is not done, but as I said a year ago, while we can't say for sure how many chapters are in this book, we can have confidence that the ending will be a good one. With that, I'll hand things over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased to report record results for our March quarter despite continued uncertainty in the macro environment. We've been operating in new ways for over a year, and we could not be more proud of the way our team continues to execute and innovate at unprecedented levels. Our revenue reached a March quarter record of $89.6 billion, an increase of over $31 billion or 54% from a year ago. We grew very strong double digits in each of our product categories, with all-time records for Mac and for Services and March quarter records for iPhone and for Wearables, Home and Accessories. We also set new March quarter records in every geographic segment with growth of at least 35% in each one of them. Products revenue was a March quarter record of $72.7 billion, up 62% over a year ago. As a result of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices reached a new all-time record in each of our major product categories. Our services set an all-time record of $16.9 billion, growing 27% over a year ago. We established new records in each geographic segment and in most service categories. I will provide more details about the performance of our services business later. Company gross margin was 42.5%, up 270 basis points from last quarter driven by cost savings, a strong mix and favorable foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.1%, growing 100 basis points sequentially also thanks to cost savings and FX, partially offset by seasonal loss of leverage. Services gross margin was 70.1%, up 170 basis points sequentially and mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $23.6 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.40 and operating cash flow of $24 billion were all March quarter records by a wide margin. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenues had a March quarter record of $47.9 billion, growing 66% year-over-year as the iPhone 12 family continue to be in high demand. Performance was consistently strong across the world as we grew strong double digits in each geographic segment and set March quarter records in most markets we track. Thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem, our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high. In the U.S. the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of over 99% for the iPhone 12 family. Turning to Services. We reached an all-time revenue record of $16.9 billion with all-time records for the App Store, cloud services, music, video, advertising and payment services. Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle, continue to scale across users, content and features and are contributing to overall services growth. The key drivers for our services business all continue to move in the right direction. First, our installed base growth has accelerated and reach an all-time high across each major product category. Second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the March quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments. Third, paid subscriptions continued to show strong growth. During the March quarter, we added more than 40 million paid subs sequentially, and we have now reached more than 660 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform. This is up $145 million from just a year ago and twice the number of paid subscriptions we are only 2.5 years ago. Finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, while also continuing to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings. For example, Apple Arcade launched its biggest expansion yet adding incredibly fun games to the catalog, including new exclusive Arcade originals, along with two entirely new categories, App Store greats and timeless classics. Apple Pay continues to expand geographically, launching in Mexico and in South Africa, bringing our payment service to six continents. Wearables, Home and Accessories grew 25% year-over-year to $7.8 billion, setting new March quarter revenue records in every geographic segment. Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experiences in this category. Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. We set an all-time revenue record of $9.1 billion, up 70% over last year, and grew very strongly in each geographic segment with all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and March quarter records in the Americas, Greater China and Japan. This amazing performance was driven by the very enthusiastic customer response to our new Macs powered by the M1 chip. iPad performance was also outstanding with revenue of $7.8 billion up 79%. We grew very strongly in every geographic segment with an all-time record in Japan and a March quarter record in rest of Asia Pacific. Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments, and we are delighted that the most recent surveys of U.S. consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 91% for Mac and 94% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction, and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active installed base for both products continues to grow nicely and reached new all-time highs. In the enterprise market, customers across many industries are accelerating their adoption of iPhone 12 and 5G as a key platform for the future of their business. Delta Airlines, for example, is putting iPhone 12 and 5G connectivity into the hands of flight attendants so they can provide the best passenger service possible as air travel rebounds. Openreach in the U.K. has started equipping tens of thousands of field engineers with iPhone 12 to speed up their deployment of broadband services to homes around the country. And UCHealth, a large health care provider in Colorado, was able to reduce per patient vaccination time from 3 minutes to only 30 seconds largely by moving from PC stations to iPhones. This has allowed their staff to rapidly scan and register new patients and vastly increase their daily vaccination capacity. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with over $204 billion in cash plus marketable securities. We issued $14 billion of new term debt and retired $3.5 billion of term debt leaving us with total debt of almost $122 billion. As a result, net cash was $83 billion at the end of the quarter. This strong position allows us to continue to invest confidently in our future, while also returning value to our shareholders. We are innovating and investing at an unprecedented pace, including accelerating our investment in the United States with our new commitment to contribute more than $430 billion and 20,000 jobs to the country over the next five years. As we continue to execute at an extremely high level, we were also able to return nearly $23 billion to shareholders during the March quarter. This included $3.4 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 147 million Apple shares. We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. Given the confidence we have in our business today and into the future, our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases. We're also raising our dividend by 7% to $0.22 per share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights assuming that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are seeing today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter revenue to grow strong double digits year-over-year. However, we believe that the sequential revenue decline from the March quarter to the June quarter will be greater than in prior years for two reasons. First, keep in mind that due to the later launch timing and strong demand, iPhone only achieved supply-demand balance during the March quarter. This will cause a steeper sequential decline than usual. Second, we believe supply constraints will have a revenue impact of $3 billion to $4 billion in the June quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million and our tax rate to be around 14.5%. Finally, reflecting the approved 7% dividend increase I just mentioned, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on May 13, 2021, to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2021. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions] Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Tim, I had sort of a big picture question on iPhone. I'm just curious, there are so many different things happening in this cycle, 5G, pandemic. How are you thinking about the opportunity for refreshing the installed base and attracting new customers? And are you seeing lives shorten given some of the programs that are being put out there by the carriers and by yourself? Just kind of maybe big picture, if you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of iPhone out there in the market.\nTim Cook: Sure, Shannon. We saw double-digit increases on a year-over-year basis on both the new to iPhone and upgraders. So -- and in fact, in the March quarter, there was actually a record number of upgraders for a March quarter. And so we like what we see. It's obviously the early days of 5G. Different countries are in different points. But penetration is still -- on a global level, is still low at this point. And so a lot of the 5G upgrades will be in front of us, not behind us. You see in China, things have moved quickly to 5G. They're moving quickly in the United States. But a lot of the other regions are slower to adopt and slower to gain coverage in 5G.\nShannon Cross: Okay. And then, Luca, can you talk about gross margin? I mean 42% is higher than it's been that I can kind of remember actually at this point, so maybe if you talk about the drivers of gross margin, and maybe if there were any offsets from higher component costs or the logistics costs that obviously were overshadowed by currency and other things?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Shannon. Yes, we did 42.5% during March, and we've guided to similar, slightly lower levels for June. So for March, we were up 270 basis points sequentially, really driven by three major factors. Cost savings, which has been good for us during the cycle. A really strong mix, a strong mix on iPhone, but in general, across all product categories, and that obviously was helpful. And foreign exchange sequentially, again, from December to March, was favorable 90 basis points. So that helped as well. So those are the three major factors there. As we transition into June, as you know, that we will expect some level of deleverage but that will be offset by cost savings. Foreign exchange doesn't have much of an impact as we go from March to June.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: I have two as well. First one, just on services, I think 90 days ago, the expectation was that line item would decelerate a little bit into the March quarter. It turned out it actually accelerated for us. I'd like to just understand what do you think drove that acceleration specifically? And is mid-20% sort of the growth norm as we go forward for Services?\nLuca Maestri: So Amit, -- our Services business did better than what we were expecting when we had the last call in January. It was stronger across the board. One of the things that we've noticed is that throughout COVID was that obviously digital services have done very well. And then we've had a couple of categories like Apple Care because many of the points of sale and stores were closed and advertising because of the reduced economic activity that were negatively affected during COVID. During the March quarter, we've seen a return to growth on Apple Care and obviously, we've reopened a lot of the stores during the course of the quarter. And advertising, obviously, consumer sentiment has improved and advertising is coming back. And so the combination of these factors really delivered this very, very strong performance during the March quarter. As we look ahead, as you know, we don't provide specific guidance for our product categories. But in general, I talked during our prepared remarks, I mean, there are a number of things that we always look at around the Services business, how many new paid accounts do we have, what number of new subscriptions do we get that -- above all, is our installed base continuing to grow? Are we adding new services? Are we improving the quality of the existing services? And so, when we look at all these fundamental vectors of our Services business, obviously we feel very good. We feel very good about it.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's helpful. And then, Tim, if I could follow up with you, it seems like engagement with iPhones and Apple devices generally has gone up materially over the last 12 months. And I don't think replacement cycles, at least in the data we see, has shrunk or changed that much at the end of the day. I'm wondering does that combination of increased usage, replacement cycles haven't changed, end up in iPhones potentially growing on a multiyear basis, because I would imagine if I'm using something more I have to replace it more often. So, I'd love your perspective on it.\nTim Cook: Yes. We're clearly seeing strong performance in both the new to iPhone or the switcher component and upgraders as I'd mentioned before. And in fact, the upgrader was the best March quarter that we've ever had in -- and so that speaks to what you're seeing, I think, a lot. It's difficult with just this far into the cycle to make a statement about the cycle in general because keep in mind that we just launched midway through the Q1 period. And so, we've only been operating for 4.5 months or so. But clearly, we like what we see right now a lot. If you look at how the iPhone did around the world, we had the top five models of smartphone in the U.S., the top selling, the top two in urban China, four out of the top five in Japan, the top four in the U.K., and the top six in Australia. And so, it was sort of across the board in some really key countries, we did really, really well. I do think that the 5G cycle is important, and we're in the early days of it, frankly.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: This was a pretty unbelievable quarter, and investors are going to ask about the sustainability of current demand trends, especially as you lap some of the benefits from COVID in areas like services and Mac later this year. So I know you don't guide beyond or provide an outlook beyond the next quarter. But can you talk from a high level over the next year, which segments do you see the opportunity to maintain strong revenue growth versus where is it reasonable to assume there will be some digestion as consumers shift their spending priorities? And then I have a follow-up for Luca.\nTim Cook: If you sort of look at the different products, iPhone, I've already mentioned some of the great momentum that we had there. Keep in mind that the compare that we're running to would be the quarter, the Q2 of last year is the quarter that China would have entered a shutdown first and then the rest of the world entered the shutdown in middle part of March. And so part of the growth is compared -- is the comparison point. But that said, the results were fabulous across the board. The shortages that Luca spoke about in the color that he provided on the future, affect primarily the iPad and the Mac. And so we'll have some challenges in there, and challenges in meeting the demand that we've got. The demand feels very strong right now. Both on the Mac side, you have the combination of M1 and work from home and remote learning. And then iPad, you've got remote learning and work from home as well. And the product that we just announced is really killer, the iPad Pro with the M1 in it. And so there's a lot of great things of the strength of the product cycle in addition to the trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. And where this pandemic will end, it seems like many companies will be operating in a hybrid kind of mode. And so it would seem that work from home and the productivity of working from home will remain very critical. If you look at Wearables then, the watch had a fabulous quarter. And I still think we're in the early innings on the watch. The number of new -- people that are new to the watch is almost three out of four. And so this is a long way from being a mature market. And so -- and then the Services by itself has really accelerated. And so all in all, we feel very, very good.\nKaty Huberty: And then, Luca, as I look at inventory plus vendor nontrade receivables, that grew only about 8% this quarter which is a big deceleration from last quarter. Should we read into that as a leading indicator for how we should think about the revenue growth deceleration in the business as the world normalizes? Or were there some supply disruptions during the quarter that caused you to drain inventory and create that tightness that you're talking about for June?\nLuca Maestri: No. On -- as you think about the June quarter, Katy, I would point you to what we said in our prepared remarks around the two factors that will influence our normal seasonality, right? One is the fact that iPhone, we launched iPhone later than usual during this cycle. And so we reached supply-demand balance only during the March quarter, which makes obviously the sequential decline steeper than usual. And then this $3 billion or $4 billion of supply constraints that Tim just said, primarily on iPad and Mac. So as you look at your model and you obviously can look at our numbers that we've done in the past, I think you can try to gauge that. From a channel inventory standpoint, we did what we normally do during a March quarter. So we reduced inventory as it's typical on iPhone. We exited within our target range. So I would say that on the inventory side, it was pretty straightforward Obviously, given that the supply constraints are on the iPad and on the Mac, we wish we had more inventory of iPad and Mac. But this is all a function of high demand for all our products.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Tim, your content offerings are still at very compelling price points. And you've seen other content providers, whether it be Spotify, Hulu, Netflix, all announced price increases recently. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about pricing as it pertains to your offering here? And if you could share any stats around the uptake of TV+ paid subs that would be great. And I have a follow-up for Luca.\nTim Cook: TV+ -- let me start with TV+. TV+ is going very well. As you know, the objective and the philosophy that we've had on TV+ is to create high-quality original content and to be one of the most desired platforms for storytellers. And I see that happening day by day as we sign more shows and more storytellers including Malala as I'd mentioned in my opening comments. To date, we've received -- the Apple originals have received 352 award nominations and had 98 wins. And this is from Oscar nominations to Indie awards to Critic Choice awards and all the rest. And we've got some shows that are -- have gotten significant buzz like Ted Lasso and The Morning Show and Defending Jacob and many others. And so we feel really good about where we are. We're not releasing subscriber numbers. But we feel good about where we are. In terms of other services and pricing, I don't have anything to announce today. We try to give the customer a great value. And we feel that we're doing that in the -- with the prices that we've got. And we'll see where we go from here.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. As my follow-up, Luca, on the June quarter guide, when you talk about the sequential decline being a little bit about perhaps the 13% or low-teens percent that we've seen historically. Are the supply constraints of the $3 billion, $4 billion impact included in that? Or is that in addition to sort of the more than average sequential decline that you're referring to? And any color on what specifically is driving the supply constraints of the subcomponent level?\nLuca Maestri: So when you look at our normal seasonality, and you've mentioned a percentage that is really an average of several years, what we're saying is that we believe that the sequential decline this year is going to be higher than that. And it's a combination of the two factors, right? One is the timing of the launch and then the very high demand for iPhone during the March quarter. And the $3 billion to $4 billion supply constraints that we mentioned. Yes, and the constraints come from the semiconductor shortages that are affecting many, many industries, and it's a combination of the shortages as well as the very, very high level of demand that we are seeing for both iPad and Mac. For Mac, for example, if you just -- just to keep it into context, the last three quarters of Mac have been the best three quarters ever in the history of the product, right? So we are experiencing an incredible level of demand, which certainly is favored by working from home and learning from home environment, but also by the incredible amount of new products and innovation that we put into the products that we launched during the last couple of quarters.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Congratulations on the great quarter. I wanted to go back to iPhone. As we think about the iPhone 12 cycle, appreciating that you guys don't give actual shipment numbers, it would appear though that the mix has been quite healthy. So I'm wondering if you could give us any context of what in this cycle you're seeing in terms of the mix relative to past cycles? Is that mix sustainable? I'm just trying to understand kind of the mix of -- within the iPhones and how that's driving, I guess, particularly gross margin. And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Aaron, let me give you a little color on that. The iPhone 12 of the -- the iPhone 12 family are or more broadly affect all iPhones. The iPhone 12 is the most popular. But we did see very strong sales of the Pro portion of the family as well, the Pro plus the Pro Max. And so the revenue that you're seeing is a function of unit growth and revenue per unit growth. Does that help?\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Can you give any context of how that might have changed this cycle relative to the prior cycles? Have we seen kind of a structural change to the higher band of the product category that you believe can be sustained going forward?\nTim Cook: We don't predict going forward other than for our internal use. But we're really happy with the results.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up back to the supply constraints. I guess it's hard to kind of see again, looking forward beyond this quarter. But what's your best assessment of when maybe the supply constraints could ease? Do you have any views of just the industry in general, overcoming some of the supply constraint dynamics?\nTim Cook: Most of our issue is on legacy nodes. And so on legacy nodes, there are many different people, not only in the same industry, but across other industries that are using legacy nodes. And so in order to really answer that question on -- accurately, we would need to know the true demand from each of these players and how that's going to change over the next few months. And so it's very, very difficult to give you good answer. I think we have a good handle on our demand. But what everybody else is doing, I don't know. And so we will do our best. That's what I can tell you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar: Congratulations on a very nice quarter. Question on semis supply as well. You just beat by a substantial margin on the top line in the March quarter. I'm curious what went in your favor to be able to secure that kind of supply that you were able to beat by, I think it was $11 million or so? And then I had a follow-up.\nTim Cook: We did not have a material supply shortage in Q2. And so how are we able to do that? You wind up collapsing all of your buffers and offsets. And that happens all the way through the supply chain. And so that enables you to go a bit higher than what we were expecting to sell when we went into the quarter 90 days ago.\nHarsh Kumar: That's very helpful. And then for my follow-up, I know there's a lot of moving parts, Tim, but with the economy sort of reopening here in the U.S., and you mentioned about supply constraints possibly on the Mac and the iPad. I was curious if I can get your thoughts, maybe just color-wise, on what you would expect for those two categories, Macs and the iPads in the second half of this year.\nTim Cook: Well, we don't predict a rev guide to product-level detail. We're not even guiding to the top level at this point because of COVID. And so I'll sidestep that question. But I would point to Luca's point earlier about the shortages and those shortages primarily affect iPad and Mac. So, we expect to be supply gated, not demand gated.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Congrats on a fantastic quarter. First question for Tim or Luca. The Greater China sales were very strong in the March quarter. Can you give some color on what drove this strength. Which hardware products or services enabled the solid outperformance in China. And then I had a follow-up.\nTim Cook: We were very pleased with our performance in China. We set a March quarter revenue record and grew strong double digits across each of the product categories. And so the revenue growth was broad. We've been especially pleased by the customer response in China to the iPhone 12 family. And as I had mentioned earlier, you have to remember that China entered the shutdown phase earlier in Q2 of last year than other countries. And so they were relatively more affected in that quarter, and that has to be taken into account as you look at the results. As I mentioned earlier, we had the top two selling smartphones in urban China, so we're very proud of that. And iPad, Mac both had enormously positive quarters with great strength across the board. And we're seeing a strong reception to the new iPad Pro as a well that we just announced. A lot of great comments and about 2/3 of the people buying Mac and iPad were buying them for the first time. And so we're attracting some new customers in China, which is really important to us.\nKrish Sankar: All right. That was very helpful, Tim. And then maybe as a follow-up, I kind of have like a big picture philosophical question, and to the extent you can answer this. One of the concerns many investors have is about the overhang of regulatory risk. I understand it's very hard to handicap that. But I'm kind of curious do you think giving more public disclosure on your Services business like App Store would help alleviate some of those concerns? Or do you think that's revealing a lot of competitive details. But kind of curious to know what you think on services disclosure.\nTim Cook: I think with the regulatory questions and scrutiny, we have to make sure that we're telling our story and why we do what we do, and we're very focused on doing that. If we feel that more disclosure would help, we would obviously move in that direction. The App Store and other parts of Apple are not cast in concrete. And so we can move and are flexible with the times. For example, in the App Store, as you know, just a couple of quarters ago, we lowered the commission rate for small developers to 15%. So that was an example of moving with the times, and we've gotten a great, great reception to that. And so we continue to learn, and I think it's very important that we're very clear about why we do what we do. The idea behind curating the App Store in order to get the privacy and security that our customers want, I think is very important, and we have to convey that in a very straightforward manner.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\nKyle McNealy: One of the things we've been positive about is how growing iPhone sales can pull along Watch and AirPods sales as well as customers shop the whole store. But you mentioned through COVID that accessories do much better in a physical store environment, and that's been hard due to the shutdowns, obviously. So my question is, have you seen any improvement in the attach rate for Watch and AirPods with iPhone? And can it get a lot better from here as the environment gets closer to normalization?\nTim Cook: I think we get a lot of benefit from our stores when they're open and are fully operational. And we're in better shape for parts of Q2 than we were previously, but we're still operating with a limited operational model in many stores and there's still some stores today that are closed like stores in Michigan and stores in France and so forth. And so I think it will take some amount of time, but my view would be as the stores get back up to speed, fully up to speed, we should be able to increase some of the accessory sales. Although I think we're doing fairly well at the moment. So it's not something that we're not doing well. Online has been much more beneficial and much more productive than we would have guessed going into this.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Vogt from UBS.\nDavid Vogt: Congratulations on a great quarter. Maybe if I could just ask a question. I know it's early days, but any commentary color from maybe the developer community on App track -- on ATT and kind of what the initial feedback and data might look like that you could share with us?\nTim Cook: Our ATT's focus is really on the user and giving the user the ability to make a decision about whether they want to be tracked or not. And so it's putting the user in the control. Not Apple, not another company, but the user of where it should be. And so that's really the focus of it. And the feedback that we've gotten from users, both before it went live when it was in the planning stages and so forth and after, has been tremendous. And so we're really standing up on behalf of the consumer here.\nDavid Vogt: Maybe just as a quick follow-up, Tim. Can you kind of discuss any sort of -- what the downloads have looked like. I know it just rolled out earlier this week and sort of the acceptance by the consumer at this point. Any sort of metrics that you can share with us, whether it's sort of an opt-in or opt-out sort of view from the consumer perspective?\nTim Cook: I don't even know the answer to that. It's not something that we would have predicted beforehand. And frankly, even if it's very low of people that don't want to be tracked, it's worth doing because of the -- those people should have the -- should make their own mind up, whether they would like to be tracked or not.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I have a couple and just wanted to get into the performance by geography here a bit, and Europe really exceptional results, particularly for this time of the year. Tim, I know you mentioned some of the 5G iPhone upgrades are in front of you, and I would assume Europe is kind of in that category. But curious to hear or maybe if you can double-click on what's driving the exceptional growth here in Europe, and like are consumers moving to 5G phones even though some of the service provider plans are not rolled out? Or are we still expecting that to be much more in front of us?\nLuca Maestri: Samik, I'll take that one. You're right. I mean we had great performance in Europe. We grew 56% during the quarter. And it was probably one of the geos where we actually saw results that were better than even our own expectations. We grew very strong double digits across the board, every product category. Particularly, I would say, iPad and Mac, they really was very, very strong. Again, obviously, Europe has been affected by lockdowns. More than most parts of the world, the lockdowns have lasted longer than here in the United States, for example. Tim was mentioning there are places in Europe still today where our stores are closed. And fortunately, we have a very strong online business that has really helped us. But working from home, learning from home, limited entertainment options, that has all played in our favor. Keep in mind that our Europe segment is a very broad version of Europe because it includes Western Europe, which has done very, very well. And then Eastern Europe and it goes into the Middle East. Even India is part of Europe. And those emerging markets have done incredibly well, significantly better than company average. So very, very pleased with some of the results in India, for example, Russia, Middle East in general. So it's been very broad, both across product categories and across countries in Europe.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. And just a quick follow-up for you, Luca. I think overall, just wanted to understand the implication of the investment plans that you announced recently for the U.S., the $430 billion over a multiyear period, getting some questions from investors of how to think about the implication on the run rate of operating expenses for the Company.\nLuca Maestri: If you remember, we announced back in 2018 that we were making a very sizable commitment to the United States. We -- at the time we announced $350 billion of investment over the following five years. And during these three years, since then, we've overachieved on those commitments, and we felt it was the right time to update these type of investments. And they span from, obviously, the investment that we made directly at Apple. For example, we talked about the creation of 20,000 new jobs at Apple over the next five years in the United States. And of course, our business has grown. And so our commitment, for example, to U.S. suppliers grows over time, and that shows in the higher numbers. In the meantime, we've got into new businesses, for example, Apple TV+, a lot of the content that we developed for our TV service is produced here in the United States. And so that's additional investment here in the United States. From an OpEx standpoint, I think as you've seen this year, we're getting a lot of leverage. This is one of those years we said many times, sometimes our OpEx grows faster than revenue, and there are some other cycles where the opposite happens. We are growing revenue this year much faster than our OpEx increase. But we want to continue to make all the necessary investments into the business. We will never under invest in our business. And so you will continue to see the fact that we -- we will continue to grow our operating expenses, particularly on the R&D side, which continues to be the core of the Company.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Samik.

Today's call is being recorded.  At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Company's business and results of operations.

For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today. It's with great gratitude for the tireless and innovative work of every Apple team member worldwide that I share the results of a very strong quarter for Apple. We achieved an all-time revenue record of $111.4 billion. We saw strong double-digit growth across every product category, and we achieved all-time revenue records in each of our geographic segments. It is not far from many of our minds that this result caps off the most challenging year any of us can remember. And it is an understatement to say that the challenges it posed to Apple as a business paled in comparison to the challenge it posed to Apple as a community of individuals, to employees, to their families and to the communities we live in and love to call home. While these results show the central role that our products played in helping our users respond to these challenges, we are doubly aware that the work ahead of all of us to navigate the end of this pandemic, to restore normal life and prosperity in our neighborhoods and local economies and, to build back with a sense of justice is profound and urgent. We will speak to these needs and Apple's efforts throughout today's call, but I want to first offer the context of a detailed look at our results this quarter, including why we outperformed our expectations. Let's get started with hardware. We hit a new high watermark for our installed base of active devices, with growth accelerating as we passed 1.65 billion devices worldwide during the December quarter. iPhone grew by 17% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 12 family, and our active installed base of iPhones is now over 1 billion. The customer response to the new iPhone 12 models' unprecedented innovation from world-class cameras to the great and growing potential of 5G has been enthusiastic, even in light of the ongoing COVID-19 impact at retail locations. iPad and Mac grew by 41% and 21%, respectively, reflecting the continuing role these devices have played in our users' lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this quarter, availability began for both our new iPad Air as well as the first generation of Macs to feature our groundbreaking M1 chip. The demand for all of these products has been very strong. We have also continued our efforts to bring the latest iPads, enriching content and professional support to educators, students and parents. Educational districts and governments worldwide are continuing major deployments, including the largest iPad deployments ever to schools in Germany and Japan. Wearables, Home and Accessories grew by 30% year-over-year, driven by significant holiday demand for the latest Apple Watch, our entire AirPods lineup, including the new AirPods Max as well as the new HomePod mini. This broad strength across the category led to new revenue records for each of its three subgroups, and we're very excited about the road ahead for these products. Look no further than the great potential of Fitness+, which pairs with Apple Watch to deliver real-time on-screen fitness data alongside world-class workouts by the world's best trainers. There are new sessions added each week, and customers are loving the flexibility, challenge and fun of these classes as well as how the pairing with Apple Watch pushes you to achieve your fitness goals. This deep integration of hardware, software and services, have always defined our approach here, and it has delivered an all-time quarterly Services record of $15.8 billion. This was the first quarter of the Apple One bundle, which brings together many of our great services into an easy subscription and with new content being added to these services every day, we feel very optimistic about where we are headed. The App Store ecosystem has been so important as individuals, families and businesses worldwide evolve and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we want to make sure that this unrivaled engine of innovation and opportunity continues. This quarter, we also took a significant new step to help smaller developers continue to experiment, innovate and scale the latest great app ideas. The App Store Small Business Program reduces the commission on the sale of digital goods and services to 15% for small businesses earning less than $1 million a year. The program launched on January 1st and we are already hearing from developers about how this change represents a transformation in their potential to create and grow on the App Store. Tomorrow is International Privacy Day, and we continue to set new standards to protect users' right to privacy, not just for our own products but to be the ripple in the pond that moves the whole industry forward. Most recently, we're in the process of deploying new requirements across the App Store ecosystem that give users more knowledge about and new tools to control the ways that apps gather and share their personal data. The winter holiday season is always a busy times for us and our products, but this year was unique. We had a record number of device activations during the last week of the quarter. And as COVID-19 kept us apart, we saw the highest volume of FaceTime calls ever this Christmas. As always, we could not have made so many holidays special without our talented and dedicated retail teams who helped us achieve a new all-time revenue record for retail, driven by very strong performance in our online store. Particularly, after the events of the last few weeks, we are focused on how we can help a moment of great national need. Because none of us should have any illusions about the challenges we face as we began a new chapter in the American story. Hope for healing, for unity and for progress begins with and depends on addressing the things that continue to wound us. In our communities, we see how every burden from COVID-19, to the resulting economic challenges, to the closure of in-person learning for students, falls heaviest on those who have always faced structural barriers to opportunity and equality. This month, Apple announced major new commitments through a $100 million Racial Equity & Justice Initiative. The Propel Center, launched with a $25 million commitment and with the support of historically black colleges and universities across the country, will help support the next-generation of leaders in fields ranging from machine learning to app development to entrepreneurship and design. And our new Apple Developer Academy in Downtown Detroit will be the first of its kind in the United States. Detroit has a vibrant culture of black entrepreneurship, including over 50,000 black-owned businesses. We want to accelerate the potential of the app economy here, knowing there is no shortage of good ideas in such a creative, resilient and dedicated community. Finally, we're committing $35 million across two investments in Harlem Capital and the Clear Vision Impact Fund that support, accelerate and grow minority-owned businesses in areas of great potential and need. In December, we concluded an unmatched year of giving. Since the inception of the Apple Giving Program in 2011, Apple employees have donated nearly $600 million and volunteered more than 1.6 million hours to over 34,000 organizations of every stride. Through our partnership with Product Red, we've adapted our 14-year $250 million effort to support HIV and AIDS work globally to ensure that care of COVID. That includes delivering millions of units of personal protective equipment to health care providers in Zambia. And here in the United States, even with COVID's effects, we are ahead of schedule on our multiyear commitment to invest $350 billion throughout the American economy. As proud as this makes us, we know there is much more to be done. Looking forward, we continue to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic but we must also now work to imagine what we will inherit on the other side. When a disease recedes, we cannot simply assume that healing follows. Even now, we see the deep scars that this period has left in our communities. Trust has been compromised, opportunities have been lost, entire portions of our lives that we took for granted, schools for children, meetings with our colleagues, small businesses that have endured for generations have simply disappeared. It will take a society-wide effort across the public and private sectors as individuals and communities, every one of us, to ensure that what's ahead of us is not simply the end of a disease, but the beginning of something durable and hopeful for those who gave, suffered and endured during this time. At Apple, we have every intention to be partners in this effort, and we look forward to working in communities around the world to make it possible. And as this chapter of uncertainty continues, so will our tireless work to help our customers stay safe, connected and well. With that, I'll hand things over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We started our fiscal 2021 with exceptional business and financial performance during the December quarter, as we set all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flow. We are thrilled with the way our teams continued to innovate and execute throughout this period of elevated uncertainty. Our revenue reached an all-time record of $111.4 billion, an increase of nearly $20 billion or 21% from a year ago. We grew strong double digits in each of our product categories, with all-time records for iPhone, Wearables, Home and Accessories and services as well as a December quarter record for Mac. We also achieved double-digit growth and new all-time records in each of our five geographic segments and in the vast majority of countries that we track. Products revenue was an all-time record of $95.7 billion, up 21% over a year ago. As a consequence of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers, our installed base of active devices passed 1.65 billion during the December quarter and reached an all-time record in each of our major product categories. Our Services set an all-time record of $15.8 billion, growing 24% year-over-year. We established new all-time records in most service categories and December quarter records in each geographic segment. I'll cover our Services business in more detail later. Company gross margin was 39.8%, up 160 basis points sequentially, thanks to leverage from higher sales and a strong mix. Products gross margin was 35.1%, growing 530 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 68.4%, up 150 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow were all-time records. Net income was $28.8 billion, up $6.5 billion or 29% over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.68, up 35% over last year and operating cash flow was $38.8 billion, an improvement of $8.2 billion. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was a record $65.6 billion, growing 17% year-over-year as demand for the iPhone 12 family was very strong despite COVID-19 and social distancing measures, which have impacted store operations in a significant manner. Our active installed base of iPhones reached a new all-time high and has now surpassed 1 billion devices, thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem. In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 12 family. Turning to Services. As I said, we reached an all-time revenue record of $15.8 billion and set all-time records in App Store, cloud services, Music, advertising, AppleCare and payment services. Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ as well as the Apple One bundle are also contributing to overall Services growth and continue to add users, content and features. The key drivers for our Services growth all continue to move in the right direction: first, our installed base growth has accelerated and each major product category; second, the number of both transacting and paid accounts on our digital content stores reached a new all-time high during the December quarter, with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our geographic segments; third, paid subscriptions continue to grow nicely, and we exceeded our target of 600 million paid subscriptions before the end of calendar 2020. During the December quarter, we added more than 35 million sequentially, and we now have more than 620 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 140 million from just a year ago. Finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current Services offerings and are adding new services that we think our customers will love. For example, Apple Music recently released its biggest product update ever with features like Listen Now, all new Search, personal radio stations and auto play. 90% of Apple Music users on iOS 14 have already used these new features. In payment services, we continue to expand our coverage, with nearly 90% of stores in the United States now accepting Apple Pay so that customers can easily have a touchless payments experience. Wearables, Home and Accessories grew 30% year-over-year to $13 billion, setting new all-time revenue records in every geographic segment. As a result of this strong performance, our Wearables business is now the size of a Fortune 120 company. Importantly, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We're very excited about the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experience in this category. Next, I'd like to talk about Mac. We set a December quarter record for revenue at $8.7 billion up 21% over last year. We grew strong-double-digits in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific as well as December quarter records in the Americas, Greater China and in Japan. This performance was driven by strong demand for the new MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac mini, all powered by our brand-new M1 chip. iPad performance was also very impressive with revenue of $8.4 billion, up 41%. We grew strong -- very strong double digits in every geographic segment, including an all-time record in Japan. During the quarter, the new -- the all-new iPad Air became available and customer response has been terrific. Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant products for our customers in the current working and learning environments. And we are delighted that the most recent surveys of consumers from 451 Research measured customer satisfaction at 93% for Mac and 94% for iPad. With this level of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active installed base for both products continues to grow nicely and reached new all-time highs. In the enterprise market, we are seeing many businesses shifting their technology investment in response to COVID. One example is our businesses are handling their hundreds of millions of office desk phones while more employees are working remotely. Last quarter, Mitsubishi UFJ Bank, one of the largest banks in the world, announced that it will be replacing 75% of its fixed phones with iPhones. By doing so, it expects to realize significant cost savings while providing a secure mobile platform to employees. We're also pleased with the rapid adoption of the Mac Employee Choice Program among the world's leading businesses, who are seeing improved productivity, increased employee satisfaction and talent retention. With the introduction of M1-powered Macs, we're excited to extend these experiences to an even broader range of customers and employees, especially in times of increased remote working. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with almost $196 billion in cash plus marketable securities and retired $1 billion of maturing debt, leaving us with total debt of $112 billion. As a result, net cash was $84 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned over $30 billion to shareholders during the December quarter, including $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $24 billion through open market repurchases of 200 million Apple shares as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be guiding to a specific revenue range. However, we are providing some directional insights, assuming that COVID-related impacts of our business do not worsen from our current assumptions for the quarter. For total company revenue, we believe growth will accelerate on a year-over-year basis, and in aggregate, follow typical seasonality on a sequential basis. At the product category level, keep in mind two items: first, during the March quarter last year, we saw elevated activity in our digital services as lockdowns occurred around the world, so our Services business faces a tougher year-over-year comparison; second, we believe the year-over-year growth in the Wearables, Home and Accessories category will decelerate compared to Q1. As you know, we were chasing demand on AirPods last year as we expanded channel inventory from Q1 to Q2. This year, we plan to decrease AirPods channel inventory as is typical after the holiday quarter. We expect gross margin to be similar to the December quarter. We expect OpEx to be between $10.7 billion and $10.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be up around $50 million and our tax rate to be around 17%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.205 per share of common stock payable on February 11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of February 8, 2021. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nA - Tejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: We'll go question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Congratulations on a really strong quarter. First question for Luca. The gross margin was particularly strong versus your outlook. Can you talk about whether you recognize the full impact of the weaker dollar in the December quarter, given your typical currency hedges? And then how are you thinking about the headwinds and tailwinds on gross margins as you go into the March quarter? And then I have a follow-up for Tim.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Katy. So yes, the gross margin was strong, was better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The reason for that was obviously, we had very strong leverage from higher sales. And the mix was strong, both the mix within products and the mix of services, and that was only partially offset by cost. As you know, we've launched many new products during the fall, and that always comes with new cost structures. So in total, it was very good. And from the FX standpoint, really, at the gross margin level, FX didn't play a role neither sequentially nor on a year-over-year basis for the December quarter, partially because of the hedges that you talked about but also because some currencies are still weaker against the dollar, they're still weaker than a year ago. Look specifically to emerging markets in Latin America, in Russia, in Turkey and so on. Clearly, if the dollar remains weak or continues to weaken, that can become a tailwind for us as we get into the March quarter. At current rates, we expect some level of benefit around 60 to 70 basis points for the March quarter.\nKaty Huberty: That's great. And Tim, one of the challenges with valuing Apple is just a limited visibility that investors have into the road map and any new categories that you might enter over time. Without, of course, commenting on any given opportunity, can you talk about the framework that you use internally to evaluate new markets that might be attractive and what you believe will determine your success as you look to enter new markets?\nTim Cook: Thanks, Katy, for the question, and thanks for not asking me any specifics. The framework that we use is very much around we ask ourselves if this is a product that we would want to use ourselves or a service that we would want to use ourselves. And that's a pretty high bar. And we ask ourselves if it's a big enough market to be in unless it's an adjacency product, of which we're looking at it very much from a customer experience point of view. And so there's no set way that we're looking at it, no formula kind of thing. But we're taking into account all of those things, and the kind of things that we love to work on are those where there's a requirement for hardware, software and services to come together because we believe that the magic really occurs at that intersection. And so hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight into how we look at it. And I think we have some good -- really good opportunities out there. And I think if you look at our current portfolio of products, we still have relatively a low share in a number of cases in very big markets. And so we feel like we have really good upside there, and we feel like we have really good upside in the Services area, too, that we've been working on for quite some time with four or five new services just coming online in the last year, year-plus, and so -- yes. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Luca, the iPhone growth exceeded your expectations despite a late launch. Can you maybe share on the unit side or the ASP side? You referred to very strong mix a couple of times on the call. And how does this change your view on the March quarter? And if you could share any color on if you're still supply constrained, and I have a follow-up for Tim.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Yes, certainly, iPhone was one of the major factors why we exceeded our own internal expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We have a fantastic product lineup and we know that, and it's been fantastic to see the customer response for new models, particularly the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. So, we've done very, very well both on units and on pricing because of the strong mix. And we've had some level of supply constraints as we went through the quarter, particularly on the Pro and the Pro Max. As you said correctly, we launched these products in the middle of the quarter, two models after four weeks, the other two models after seven weeks. And so obviously, we had a very steep ramp, which fortunately went very, very well. The products are doing very well all around the world. I think you've seen that our performance has been particularly strong in China, where we've seen phenomenal customer response that probably. There was also some level of pent-up demand for 5G iPhones, given that the market is moving very quickly to 5G. And so as we look ahead into the March quarter, we're very optimistic. We believe we're going to be able to be in supply-demand balance for all the models at some point during the quarter. And it's -- the product is doing very well all around the world.\nWamsi Mohan: Great. And Tim, you mentioned about the strength of the installed base performance, which continues to grow very impressively at this scale. Can you maybe help us think through how the switcher versus upgrade activity has been tracking in recent quarters? I would love to get your thoughts on that.\nTim Cook: Yes. Thanks for the question. If you look at this past quarter, which has -- we started selling two of the iPhones 4 weeks into the quarter and the other two, seven weeks into the quarter. And so I would caution that this is in the early going. But in looking at the iPhone 12 family, we saw both switchers and upgraders increase on a year-over-year basis. And in fact, we saw the largest number of upgraders that we've ever seen in a quarter. And so, we were very thrilled about that.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Tim, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? Clearly, significant sequential growth, which I think has a lot to do with iPhone. But I'm curious, both from an iPhone as well as your other product categories, what you're seeing and how much back to normal you think the Chinese market is? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes. China was more than an iPhone story. iPhone did do very well there. And sort of like the world, if you look at both switchers and upgraders, we were up year-over-year, and China also had a record number of upgraders during the quarter, the most we've ever seen in a quarter. I think probably some portion of this was that people probably delayed purchasing in the previous quarter as rumors started appearing about an iPhone. Keep in mind that 5G in China is -- the network is well established. And the overwhelming majority of phones being sold are 5G phones. And so I think there was some level of anticipation for us delivering an iPhone with 5G. And so, iPhone did extremely well. However, the other products did as well. I mean, we could not have turned in a performance like we did with only iPhone. iPad did extremely well, far beyond the Company average. Mac was about the Company average. Wearables, Home and Accessories was above the Company average. And so if you really look at it, we did really well across the Board there. In terms of COVID, I think they're -- at least for last quarter, they were beat -- sort of beyond COVID, very much in the recovery stage. This quarter, there are different reports about some cases in some places and lockdowns occurring but we have not seen that in our business as yet. Of course, those cases are much smaller than the ones in other countries.\nShannon Cross: Right. I guess the other thing I was curious about, with regard to the Services business, if we could dig a little bit more, I think this is one of the first times when Luca, you talked about Apple TV+, Arcade, Apple Pay, some of the smaller services actually kind of moving the needle. And then I was also curious, you had a number of stores closed at least later in the quarter, and that typically has impacted some of your AppleCare revenue and yet you outperformed. So, maybe if you could talk about a bit more about the drivers of the Services revenue?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. I mean, really, it's been strong across the Board. There are two businesses during COVID that have been impacted negatively, and then we talked about it in the past. One is AppleCare. Obviously, when the stores are closed, it's tougher, of course, for customers to have the interaction with us. And advertising, which is -- it's in line with the overall level of economic activity. What happened during the December quarter is that in-store traffic improved. And so AppleCare, we grew -- we didn't grow as much as company average but we grew in AppleCare, set an all-time record there in spite of the fact that, yes, we are running, particularly in December, we started closing a few stores, particularly here in the United States but also in Western Europe. But in total, we were able to support more customers than in past quarters. And we also saw a sequential acceleration in advertising and so that also helped the overall growth rate. Clearly, the strength was in digital services, in the App Store, in cloud services, in Music. Those were the services that really delivered very, very strong performance. It's something that we've seen happen during the COVID environment.\nOperator: We'll hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi: I also have one for Luca and one for Tim. Luca, I was wondering if we could just probe a little bit more into iPhone. Maybe you can just -- you talked about a drawdown in channel inventory last quarter. Our iPhone channel inventory is sort of at normal levels now exiting Q1. And should we be thinking about above-seasonal iPhone growth, given that you're still not in supply-demand balance and you had fewer selling days in fiscal Q1? Should we be thinking about sort of above-seasonal iPhone growth looking into Q2?\nLuca Maestri: So on the December performance, as you know, Toni, this was a very different cycle because we launched at a different time than usual. And so, we had an initial part of the quarter where, obviously, we didn't have the new phones. And then as we launched the new phones, we also did the channel fill that typically happens, to a certain extent, in the September quarter. At the end of the quarter, the demand has been very strong. And so we've been constrained, as I said, on -- especially in the Pro models. At the end of December, we exited with a level of iPhone channel inventory, which was slightly below a year ago. So we -- and we still had some level of supply constraints, which we believe we're going to be able to solve during the March quarter. In terms of the sequential change, we talked about -- during the prepared remarks, we talked about total company average, and we said that we expect that sequential progression to be similar to the typical seasonality that you've seen in past years. Certainly, last year is not typical because of COVID. But if you go back, fiscal '17, '18, '19, that's our typical seasonal progression. And we mentioned a couple of product categories, Services and Wearables, where we're going to be having a slightly more difficult compare. And so I think you can draw your conclusions around the iPhone.\nToni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then, Tim, I was wondering if you could just comment more broadly around growth for Apple and sources of growth. The Company this year is going to be well over $300 billion in revenue. Historically, you've issued acquisitions. And I'm wondering if you could comment whether you still feel confident that Apple has Apple organic growth opportunities and that you don't believe acquisitions are an important source of growth? And then I think perhaps most importantly, as you look out, let's say, over the next five years, what do you think is a realistic revenue growth rate for Apple going forward?\nTim Cook: Yes. Toni, as you know, we give some color on the current quarter but not beyond that in terms of growth rates, so I'll punt that part of your question. But if you back up and look at the sort of the ingredients that we have at this point, we have the strongest hardware portfolio that we've ever had. And we have a great product pipeline for the future, both in products and in Services. We have an installed base that has hit new highs that we just talked about earlier in our opening comments. And we're still attracting a fair number of switchers and, of course, upgraders. We just set an all-time Services record, and we have that installed base to compound that, and particularly with the added services that we've had over the last year or so, that as they grow and mature, will contribute even more to the Services revenue stream. And on the Wearables side, we've brought this thing from zero to a Fortune 120 company, which was no small feat. But I still think that we're in the early stages of those products. If you look at our share in some of the other products, whether you look in iPhone or Mac or iPad, you find that the share numbers leave a fair amount of headroom for market share expansion. And this is particularly the case in some of the emerging markets, where we're proud of how we've done but there's a lot more headroom in those markets. Like if you take India as an example, we doubled our business last quarter compared to the year ago quarter. But our absolute level of business there is still quite low relative to the size of the opportunity. And you can kind of take that and go around the world and find other markets that are like that as well. And of course, the other thing from a market point of view is we're -- we've been on a multiyear effort in the enterprise and have gained quite a bit of traction there. You've heard some of the things in Luca's comments today and we comment some on it each quarter. We're very optimistic about what we can do in that space. And then, of course, we've got new things that we're not going to talk about that we think will contribute to the Company as well, just like other new things have contributed nicely to the Company in the past. So, we see lots of opportunity. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: We'll hear from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: I have two questions as well. I guess, starting with you, Luca, I just wanted to go back to the gross margin discussion, and we really haven't seen gross margins at this level, high 39%, I think, since 2016. Could you maybe step back and talk, what has enabled the shift higher? What are the key drivers to get you there? And is commodity tailwind or in-sourcing of some components really a big part of this? So just love to understand the durability of the gross margin at these levels. And what are the big drivers that got us here?\nLuca Maestri: Well, I mean, of course, when you grow the way we've grown this quarter, 21%, it's -- obviously, we have a certain level of fixed cost in our product structures, right? And so a high level of sales helps margin expansion without a doubt, and so that has been probably the biggest factor, to be honest. And then as I was saying earlier, we've had, across the Board, in Services, in every product category, we've had a very strong mix of products, right? We were talking about the iPhone, the Pro and the Pro Max, and that's been pretty much the case in every product category. So the mix has also been very good. The commodity environment is fairly benign. And the one thing that has not affected us this time around is the FX that it's true, it has not been a tailwind yet for the reasons that I was explaining to Katy, but at the same time, it has not been a negative. And the reality is that FX for us has been a negative over the last five or six years, almost every quarter. And so that has changed. And that obviously makes a difference.\nAmit Daryanani: And then Tim and when I look at the growth rates on Mac and iPads, they've been in the 20% to 40% range for the last three quarters, and I suspect some of this is just folks contending with the pandemic. But love to understand, when you look at these growth rates, how much of this do you think is replacement cycle-driven folks upgrading with at home versus new customers and new folks that are coming into the Apple ecosystem? And do you see, I guess, what sort of growth rates do you think is more durable or predictable as we go forward over here?\nTim Cook: If you look at the switcher or the switchers, if you look at the new to Mac and new to iPad, these numbers are still about, at a worldwide level, about half of the purchases that are coming from people that are new. And so the installed base is still expanding with new customers in it. And so that's true on both iPad and Mac. If you look at Mac, the M1, I think, gives us a new growth trajectory that we haven't had in the past. Certainly, if Q1 is a good proxy, there's lots of excitement about M1-based Macs. As you know, we're partly through the transition. We've got more -- a lot more to do there. We're early days of a two-year transition, but we're excited about what we see so far. The iPad, as we went out with the iPad Air, and we now have the best iPad lineup we've ever had, and it's clear that some people are using these as laptop replacements. Others are using them as complementary to their desktop. But the level of growth there has been phenomenal. You look at it at 41%. And yes, part of it is work from home and part of it is just learning. But I think I wouldn't underestimate how much of it is the product itself on -- in both the case of iPad and Mac. And of course, our share in the Mac is quite low. In the -- for the total personal computer market. And so there's lots of headroom there.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Congrats on the record quarter from my side as well. I guess I wanted to start off with iPhone sales. I think in -- general impression we have is China and North America have more robust 5G infrastructure. I just wanted to see kind of what are you seeing in terms of customer engagement or velocity of sales for iPhone in Europe, where I think the general impression is that service providers haven't rolled out robust 5G services. Is that something that's impacting customer interest in the latest lineup in the region? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: If you look at the 5G rollout in Europe, it's true that Europe is not in the place of -- certainly nowhere close to where China is and nowhere close to the U.S. either. But there are other regions that 5G is -- that has very good coverage, like Korea is an example. And so the the world, I would describe it right now, is more of a patchwork more to do that we haven't had in quilt. There are places that there's really excellent coverage. There are places where -- within a country that is very good but not from a nationwide point of view. And then there are places that really haven't gotten started yet. Latin America is more closer to the last one. There's lots of opportunity ahead of us there. And I think Europe is where there are 5G implementations there. I think most of that growth is probably in front of us there as well.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. As a follow-up, if I can just ask you, I think you mentioned the momentum you're seeing for the Apple One bundle, which I think has been a couple of months now since you launched it. Any metrics to share in terms of what you're seeing for conversion rate of customers or even insights into which services are turning in that bundle, are turning out to be the anchor Services that's driving adoption of that bundle?\nTim Cook: It's really too early to answer some of those questions. As you know, we just got started into the quarter in Q1 so we have less than a quarter on this right now. What we wanted to accomplish with it, we're clearly accomplishing, which is making our Services very easy to subscribe to. Our customers clearly told us that they wanted to subscribe to several services or, in some cases, all of our services. And so, we've made that very simple, and it's clear from the early going that it's working but we've just gotten started on it.\nOperator: We'll hear from Krish Sankar with Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: Congrats on the very strong results. My first question is for Tim. Tim, I want to talk a little bit about your search and advertising business. How do you think of the long-term growth opportunities in advertising? How do you think it -- how long can it grow at two times to three times the App Store growth rate? And also, are there any applications where your fundamental search technology, AI could be adapted for other parts of the Services business, that's the first question. And then I have a quick follow-up for Luca after that.\nTim Cook: The search advertising business is going well. It's a -- there's lots of intent from search. And we do it in a very private kind of manner, observing great privacy policies and so forth. And I think people see so forth. And I think people see that and are willing to try it out. And we have been growing nicely in that area. It's a part of the advertising area that Luca spoke of earlier.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it. And then a follow-up for Luca. When you look at your Services segment in the March quarter, in China, you typically see a bump due to gaming downloads during Chinese New Year. So should see a similar trend this time around? But do you think with a pandemic, and people think for me at home, that kind of seasonal bump might not happen in China for gaming downloads?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. I mean, I think I was mentioning it during the prepared remarks. We -- clearly, in China, the March quarter is typically the strongest quarter for our Services business and for the App Store because of Chinese New Year, as you mentioned. And last year, what we saw was an increased level of activity because after Chinese New Year, the whole country went into lockdown for several weeks. And so that propensity for playing games continued for several weeks, more than a typical cycle. So, we expect to have a great quarter in China, but at the same time, you need to keep in mind that the compare is going to of what happened a year ago.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nChris Caso: The first question is on iPhone ASPs and I know you don't disclose the numbers there, but I wonder if you could speak about it qualitatively. You spoke about the richer mix, but there were also some price differences as compared to a year ago. iPhone 12 came higher price point. The Pro established a new price point. Can you speak to how that the level of benefit that you saw there? And going forward, are you confident that you can continue to improve the next in iPhone going forward?\nLuca Maestri: So, as I said earlier, we grew iPhone revenue 17%. That growth came from both unit sales and ASPs because of the strong mix that I mentioned before. So, I think that answers your question for the December quarter. What we've seen so far, it's very early because we launched the new products only a few weeks ago. What we've seen so far is a very high level of interest for the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. We worked very hard to ramp up our supply. We've had some supply constraints during the December quarter. We think we're going to be able to solve them during the March quarter. But so far, the mix has been very strong on iPhone.\nChris Caso: Okay. As a follow-up question, if you could talk a bit to the benefit that you may have seen from some of the carrier actions? We've seen very aggressive trade-ins during the quarter. Did that provide a benefit, in your view, on units or mix or perhaps both? And what would be the level of permanence that you would see in some of those actions such that if those subsidies were removed, could that potentially be a headwind going forward?\nTim Cook: I think, Chris, it's Tim. I think subsidies always help, that anything that reduces the price to the customer is good for the customer and obviously good for the carrier that's doing it and good for us as well. And so, it's a win across the board. I believe that, at least based on what I see right now is that there would be probably continuing to have quite a bit of competition in the market, if you're talking about the U.S. market for customers as the carriers work to get more customers to move to 5G. Outside of the U.S., the subsidies are not used in all geographies, and so it really varies greatly by country. Some of them are separate completely, the handset and the service. And in those areas, we don't have subsidies.\nOperator: We'll go ahead and hear from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJames Suva: It's amazing how your company has pivoted and progressed through this uncertain time in society. A lot of the pushback we get on our view on Apple is that everyone around them or that they know developed countries has an iPhone or Apple product and the market is kind of being saturated some. But when I look at other countries like India, I believe statistically, you are materially below that in market share. So are you doing active efforts there? It seems like there's been some news reports of moving supply chain there. Or you recently opened up an Apple Store. How should we think about that? Because it just seems like you're really not full market share equally around the world.\nTim Cook: Yes. There are several markets, as I alluded to before. India is one of those, where our share is quite low. It did improve from the year-ago quarter. Our business roughly doubled over that period of time. And so we feel very good about the trajectory. We are doing a number of things in the area. We put the online store there, for example, and last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store. And that has gotten a great reaction to it and has helped us achieve the results that we got to last quarter. We're also going in there with retail stores in the future. And so we look for that to be another great initiative and we continue to develop the channel as well. And so there's lots of things, not only in India but in several of the other markets that you might name where our share is lower than we would like. And I -- again, I would also say, even in the developed markets, when you look at our share, definitely, everybody doesn't have an iPhone, not even close. And so, we really don't have a significant share in any market. So, there's headroom left even in those developed markets where you might hear that.\nJames Suva: Congratulations to your team and employees.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Jim. Appreciate that.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcast, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

Over the past year, despite a range of challenges facing the world, our teams have come together in incredible ways to drive unparalleled innovation and deliver again and again for our customers. For the September quarter, we reported record revenue of $90.1 billion, which was better than we anticipated despite stronger-than-expected foreign currency headwinds. We set an all-time revenue record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Services notched a September quarter record as well with revenue of $19.2 billion and more than 900 million paid subscriptions. We reached another record on our installed base of active devices, thanks to a quarterly record of upgraders and double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone. Across nearly every geographic segment, we reached a new revenue record for the quarter. And we continue to perform incredibly well in emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in India, Southeast Asia and Latin America. I'm also happy to report that during the quarter, silicon-related supply constraints were not significant. I want to acknowledge that we are still living through unprecedented times. From war in Eastern Europe to the persistence of COVID-19, from climate disasters around the world to an increasingly difficult economic environment, a lot of people and a lot of places are struggling. Through it all, we've aimed to help our customers navigate through the challenges while giving them the tools to drive progress for themselves and their communities. At Apple, creativity and collaboration have always been at the core of who we are. That spirit of ingenuity and teamwork helped us provide our customers with incredible innovations this year and led to another yearly revenue record. In fiscal 2022, Apple achieved revenue of $394 billion, representing 8% annual growth. We set records for iPhone, Mac, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services while growing double digits in emerging markets and setting records in the vast majority of markets we track. Customers are loving our iPhone 14 lineup. Loaded with camera upgrades for sharper photos, Action Mode for smoother videos and new safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite, iPhone is even more indispensable to our daily lives. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with a new dual-camera system, industry-leading durability, incredible power and amazing battery life. And our iPhone 14 Pro models are packed with even more groundbreaking innovations, including a new camera system as well as always-on display and the Dynamic Island, which offers a whole new way to interact with iPhone. Just yesterday, our most advanced iPad and iPad Pro ever landed in stores. With its all-screen design, advanced cameras and faster wireless connectivity, the tenth generation iPad looks and performs better than ever. For creatives, iPad Pro, now turbocharged by the blazingly fast M2 chip, is the perfect device to make something amazing. Our Mac customers have already been raving about the power of M2 since the arrival of our newest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro this summer. Their incredible long battery life, stunningly rich display and lightning fast speeds are a signature part of the Mac experience and helped drive an all-time record revenue for Mac during the September quarter. In Wearables, Home and Accessories a wave of innovation spurred 10% year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. New features in Apple Watch Series 8, including temperature sensing capabilities, retrospective ovulation estimates and crash detection are helping to keep customers healthier and safer. And the updated Apple Watch SE is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, delivering advanced features at a new low price. The biggest, brightest and boldest Apple Watch ever made, Apple Watch Ultra pushes the boundaries of what a smartwatch can do.  Packed with innovations like advanced navigation tools and the new Oceanic+ app, which turns it into a dive computer, Apple Watch Ultra has something for athletes and adventures on land and sea. The second generation of AirPods Pro powered by the new H2 chip are receiving rave reviews for delivering an unmatched wireless earbud audio experience, while canceling up to twice as much noise over the previous model. There's no better place to discover the rich spatial audio capabilities of AirPods Pro than Apple Music, the largest music catalog anywhere now with more than 100 million songs. And there's no other company that fuses best-in-class hardware with cutting-edge software and services to create a truly integrated and seamless experience. With iOS 16, we're giving customers more ways to personalize their iPhones through a customizable lock screen and focus filters. New features in Messages and Mail enable users to connect and collaborate like never before. Stage Manager in iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura, helps users stay more productive with smoother multitasking. And watchOS 9 is empowering customers to live a healthier day through updates to the Sleep App, a new FDA-cleared AFib history feature and the new Medications app. Across our Services, we continue to see enthusiasm and strong engagement from our subscribers. Apple TV+ hits like Severance, Bad Sisters and Blackbird have taken center stage on screens around the world. And baseball fans were glued to their seats this season watching Friday Night Baseball. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ productions continue to earn accolades. At the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards in September, Apple brought home 9 statues, including a second consecutive win for Best Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. And soon, we're going to give audiences an even better entertainment experience when the all-new Apple TV 4K hit stores next week. We're also bringing Fitness+ to more customers than ever by making our entire library of over 3,000 studio-style workouts and meditations available to iPhone users in 21 countries, even those without an Apple Watch. These updates are arriving just in time for a new Artist Spotlight series with workouts featuring the music of Taylor Swift and a new workout program, Yoga for Every Runner featuring and design with one of the world's top ultramarathon athletes, Scott Jurek. While Fitness+ helps subscribers stay active, Apple Card is designed with our customers' financial health in mind. For the second year in a row, Apple Card has been ranked highest in customer satisfaction for midsized credit card issuers by J.D. Power. And our users' favorite Apple Card benefit just got even better with the upcoming addition of a new high-yield savings account to help them save and grow their daily cash rewards. Turning to retail. Last month, our team members welcomed customers to the all-new Apple Jamsil in South Korea. And through today at Apple Creative Studios, we partnered with non-profits in cities around the world to help young diverse creatives pursue their passions and connect with local mentors. And our retail teams have done exceptional work, helping customers explore our latest products and features. As we approach the holiday season with our product lineup set, I'd like to share my gratitude to our retail, AppleCare and channel teams for the work they are doing to support customers. At Apple, we're proud of the ways we are able to help customers be productive, get healthy, stay safe and unlock their creative potential. We also understand we have important responsibilities to the communities we serve. That's why we continue to invest in education, racial equity and justice and the environment. And we are making important progress toward a more inclusive and diverse workforce. Through our Community Education Initiative, we're working alongside more than 150 partners to help students around the world learn new science and technology skills. This summer, we joined with community partners to support coding academies across the United States from Code Academy in Nashville to One Summer Chicago to the Coding 5K Camp for Girls right next door in San Jose. We've also just expanded our racial equity and justice initiative into the UK for the first time. Alongside the South Pink Center, we're helping aspiring creators develop their own voices and position themselves for long-lasting careers. Back in the US, we welcomed a new class of Black, Latino and indigenous entrepreneurs to Apple's second Impact Accelerator. This group of innovators is focused on using green technology to mitigate the effects of climate change and serve communities most affected by it. At Apple, we care deeply about protecting the planet for future generations. To that end, in support of our 2030 environmental goals, we have asked all of our suppliers to become carbon-neutral across their entire Apple-related footprint by the end of the decade. We are also providing them with resources based on what we learned achieving net-zero carbon in our own global operations. Across our entire product lineup, we also continue to source more materials through recycling while taking less from the Earth. Every iPhone 14 is made with 100% recycled rare-earth elements in all magnets, including those used in MagSafe. And in a first for Apple Watch and iPad, we're using recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards in our newest devices. While we're working to reduce the footprint of our hardware, we're making changes to our software to be more environmentally-friendly with the soon-to-be released Clean Energy charging feature for iPhone. Our 2030 goal is a reflection of our relentless focus on the future at Apple. The world continues to be unpredictable as old challenges evolve and new ones emerge. What remains constant is the ability of our teams to create great products, services and experiences while being a force for good in the world. Whatever challenges lie ahead in the new year, we're moving forward, as we always have, investing for the long-term to deliver incredible innovations for our customers like only Apple can. And now, I'll hand it over to Luca for more details on our performance.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the September quarter that capped another record fiscal year for Apple despite a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop. We reached a September quarter revenue record of $90.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year despite over 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact, with new September quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific. Importantly, in constant currency, we grew nicely in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit growth outside the US. Products revenue was $71 billion, up 9% over last year despite FX headwinds and a record for the September quarter. And it was a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories and an all-time revenue record for Mac. Overall, our installed base of active devices continue to grow nicely. It reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments at the end of the quarter, thanks to extremely strong customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers that are new to our products. Our Services set a September quarter revenue record of $19.2 billion, up 5% over a year ago despite over 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific and also in many Services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services and payment services. Company gross margin was a September quarter record at 42.3%. It was down 100 basis points from last quarter due to unfavorable foreign exchange and a different mix, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 34.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially, with improved leverage and favorable mix partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.5%, down 100 basis points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange. Net income of $20.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.29 and operating cash flow of $24.1 billion were all September quarter records. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 10% year-over-year to a September quarter record of $42.6 billion, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. We set September quarter records in the vast majority of markets we track, and our performance was particularly impressive in several large emerging markets, with India setting a new all-time revenue record and Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico more than doubling year-over-year. Thanks to our strong iPhone lineup, we set a quarterly record for upgraders and grew switchers double digits. This level of sales performance, along with unmatched customer loyalty, drove the active installed base of iPhones to a new all-time high across all geographic segments. And the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. It was a great quarter for Mac. We achieved an all-time revenue record of $11.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year, despite significant FX headwinds. There were three key items that helped drive this performance. First, we benefited from the launch of our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by the M2 chip. Second, we were able to satisfy pent-up demand that carried forward from the significant supply constraints we faced during the June quarter. Third, as our supply position improved, we were able to fill the channel. Importantly, our investment in the category has attracted both upgraders and customers new to Mac and helped our installed base reach an all-time high. In fact, we set a quarterly record for upgraders, while nearly half of customers buying Macs during the quarter were new to the device. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to significant negative foreign exchange and a challenging compare due to the launch of new iPads a year ago. Despite this, the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.7 billion, growing 10% year-over-year, driven by the launch of Apple Watch and new AirPods Pro. This level of safe performance along with very strong new tool rates, drove our installed base of devices in the category to a new all-time record. For instance, two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to Services, as I mentioned, we set a September quarter record in aggregate and in most geographic segments, generating $19.2 billion in revenue in spite of very large foreign exchange headwinds. It is important to remember, that we achieved double-digit constant currency growth in Services on top of growing 26% during the September quarter a year ago. However, certain services were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign exchange. Digital advertising and gaming are areas where we've seen some softness. Throughout the quarter, we continued to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem and our long-term opportunity in the category. First, our continued installed base growth across each geographic segment and each major product category represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. The percentage of accounts that pay for our services continues to increase, and we still see plenty of opportunity ahead of us. Third, paid subscriptions showed very strong growth. We now have more than 900 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, up more than 155 million during the last 12 months alone and double what we had just three years ago. We continue investing in new content and features, across our service offerings. For example, we added several popular sports titles to Apple Arcade. We're also excited about our global partnership with Major League Soccer, where starting next season, fans can stream every single MLS match through the Apple TV app. This momentum helped us achieve over $78 billion in Services revenue during fiscal 2022, a new record and up 14% year-over-year. We continue to invest confidently and believe strongly in the long-term potential of our Services business, which is already the size of a Fortune 50 business on its own, and has nearly doubled during the last four years. It was not only a record year for Services but also for our entire company. During the past four quarters, we grew our business by 8% or $29 billion, reaching more than $394 billion of revenue. We grew diluted earnings per share by 9% and generated over $111 billion of free cash flow, up 20% year-over-year. It was also a strong year for our enterprise business, as we set new annual records for iPhone, iPad and Mac during fiscal 2022 and grew strong double-digits year-over-year as our devices and services continue to help more-and-more companies empower their employees and serve their customers. For instance, Ford Manufacturing employees are using iPad and iPhone to help further improve the quality of its game-changing Ford F-150 Lightning electric trucks. iPhone's powerful A-series chip and advanced camera systems, along with third-party iOS apps, are enabling Ford to automate the visual quality inspection process in real-time to help address issues before they impact customers. And Cisco expanded its Macs as a choice program and is now offering it to all its employees to help attract and retain top talent. And when given this choice, employees have chosen Macs twice as often as other options. In addition, many enterprise customers are taking advantage of the high residual value of our products and simple trade-in process to standardize the refresh cycles for their fleets of Apple devices. This allows employees to upgrade to the latest devices regularly while making it highly predictable and cost effective for the business. Let me now turn to our cash position. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, which enabled us to return over $29 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25.2 billion through open market repurchases of 160 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $169 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.8 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $1 billion while issuing $5.5 billion of new debt, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $49 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress toward our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Overall, we believe total company year-over-year revenue performance will decelerate during the December quarter as compared to the September quarter for a number of reasons. First, we expect nearly 10 percentage points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange.  Second, on Mac, in addition to increasing FX headwinds, we have a very challenging compare against last year, which had the benefit of the launch and associated channel fill of our newly redesigned MacBook Pro with M1. Therefore, we expect Mac revenue to decline substantially year-over-year during the December quarter. Specifically on Services, we expect to grow but to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment increasingly affecting foreign exchange, digital advertising and gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.7 billion and $14.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we please have the first question?\nOperator: We'll go ahead and take our first question from Shannon Cross calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nQ \u2013 Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. It's great to talk to you on the call again. I'm wondering, can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about this iPhone generation? On the positive side, you've raised prices. It seems to be mixing up. On the negative side, investors are concerned about impacted demand from the higher prices, what Huawei meant to you in prior years versus what could happen now. There are just some pressures out there. So I'm curious if you can kind of talk to what you're seeing initially in iPhone demand and how you think it will move through. With the caveat that I understand, things are pretty uncertain out there. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Shannon, it's Tim. Welcome back. iPhone grew 10% in the Q4 timeframe to $42.6 billion. Customer demand was strong and better than we anticipated that it would be. And keep in mind that this is on top of a fiscal year of 2021 that had iPhone revenue grow by 39%, and so it's a tough compare as well. And so we were happy with it. In terms of the new products, the 14 and the 14 Pro and Pro Max, the -- it's still very early. But since the beginning, we've been constrained on the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max and we continue to be constrained today. And so we're working very hard to fulfill the demand. It's difficult to say what the mix will be until we can satisfy the demand because we don't really -- we're not able to determine the accurate mix until then. And so we -- but we're working very hard to do that. We were really pleased with the broadness of the iPhone strength last quarter. We had three of the top four smartphones in the U.S. and the UK, the top three in Urban China, the top six in Australia, four out of the top five in Germany and the top two in Japan. And customer satisfaction for the iPhone remains very, very strong at 98%. And so we feel very good about how we performed in Q4. And certainly, the start of this generation would suggest that we're going to be constrained for a little while on the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. But we're working very hard to try to remedy that.\nShannon Cross: Thank you. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit about gross margin puts and takes? Just how we should think about, I mean, 10 basis points of currency this coming quarter is, I don't want to say unprecedented, but maybe it is. So I know you have hedges, but how do we think about it flowing through? And then what other -- components seem to be very favorable. But what else should we throw into the mix as we look forward?\nLuca Maestri: Yeah. Well, let me start with gross margin in Q4 and then I'll get to Q1. It was a September quarter record for the company. We did 42.3%, and that is in spite of, as you mentioned, very significant negative FX in -- for example, for Q4, on a sequential basis, FX was negative 70 basis points and on a year-over-year basis it was negative 170 basis points. Essentially every currency around the world has weakened against the dollar. Now, we have guided Q1 to 42.5% to 43.5% in spite of the fact that we have, on a year-over-year basis, 330 basis points of negative exchange. Sequentially, it's 120 basis points unfavorable. So obviously, the strong dollar makes it difficult in a number of areas. Obviously, our pricing in emerging markets makes it difficult, and the translation of that revenue back into dollars is affected. But on the positive side, we are seeing commodities behave fairly favorably for us. And so we believe we can offset the foreign exchange \u2013 the negative foreign exchange that we're seeing. And I think that the guidance that we provided reflects that. It takes into account, of course, FX. It takes into account some level of inflationary pressures. But I think the outcome is, I think, is a good one.\nShannon Cross: Great. Thank you very much.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question is coming from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.\nErik Woodring: Hey, guys, thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Maybe if we could just start. Luca, we saw quite the divergence in iPad and Mac performance this quarter. Both were relatively constrained from a supply perspective. So maybe can you just elaborate on some of the most impacted -- important factors that contributed to kind of the divergence in performance and whether after we get through the December quarter, those can reverse or normalize? And then I have a follow-up.\nA \u2013 Tim Cook: Yeah, Erik, it's Tim. I'll take your question. On \u2013 if you look at the Mac, the Mac, it was the best quarter we've ever had in the history of the company. It was helped by the product launch of the MacBook Air with M2. It was helped that in the previous quarter, in the June quarter, if you remember, we lost output from the factory for a significant portion of the quarter. And so we had a backlog exiting our Q3 headed into Q4. We were able to satisfy all of that demand during Q4 and filled the channel for the Mac. And so that led to an incredible Mac quarter. If you look at iPad, iPad had sort of the opposite happening from a launch point of view. The comp from a year ago, we launched iPads in September. We launched iPads this year in October. The other point to remember is that the iPad Pro had just launched before the quarter started in the year-ago quarter so it was our first full quarter of iPad Pro. So it was an exceptionally strong iPad quarter a year ago, and the launches were really key to that performance. And so that's the reason iPad contracted during this quarter.\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you, Tim. And then maybe, Luca, if I were just to ask you, obviously, Tejas at the beginning of the call talked about the 14-week quarter. Maybe can you just elaborate a little bit on how you think that 14-week quarter impacts different line items, whether it's products or certain segments within the product business or the Services stand-alone? Just where we should see that 14-week quarter provide a bit more of a tailwind versus maybe not have an impact at all? And that's it for me. Thanks. \nLuca Maestri: In general, we have a few more days in the quarter that we're going to -- are going to affect both our revenues and our costs. Not every week is equal because obviously, we have certain peaks during the course of the quarter. Think about Black Friday or the Christmas holiday. But, in general, we're adding a few days of sale and additional OpEx as well on the cost front. So that's what happens to us every approximately six years as we need to align our weekly calendar to the fiscal calendar.\nErik Woodring: Super. Thanks, guys.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes, sir. The next question is coming from Ben Bollin calling from Cleveland Research.\nBen Bollin: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping we could talk a little bit about services, pieces within the portfolio. It looks like there's been some price adjustments as of late with respect to Music, TV+ and the One bundle. I'm curious how you think about balancing the consumer price versus your own costs and kind of the associated follow-through. And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at the price increase that you referenced, Ben, on Monday of this week, we announced a price increase on Apple Music and on Apple TV+ and then the corresponding Apple One, that is the consolidated bundle that includes both of those. On -- there's really two different situations here. With Music, the cost of licensing increased. And so we are paying more for music. The good thing about that is the artist will also get more money for their songs that are enjoyed on streaming. And so there's some bit of good news there, I suppose. And then on Apple TV+, if you look at when we first priced it, we only had a very few shows. We were at the beginning. We are very focused on originals only, and so we had four or five shows or so in the beginning and priced it quite low. We now have a lot more content and are coming out on -- with more each and every month. And so, we've increased the price to represent the value of the service. And of course, Apple One is just the consolidation of those two price changes.\nBen Bollin: Okay. And then, another item. Any preliminary thoughts around capital intensity into fiscal 2023? Last couple of years, CapEx has been relatively stable. Can you talk to the big constituents of the CapEx figure and maybe any moving pieces and how we could think about that to 2023? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Ben. So when we look at our CapEx, as you correctly said, I mean, we've been fairly stable, and I think our capital intensity is really very good. We have three major buckets in CapEx for the company. We have certain dedicated tools for the manufacturing facilities. We had some spend around data centers, and we have spend around our office facilities around the world. We obviously monitor all of them. There is nothing unusual that we see for the next 12 months.\nBen Bollin: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Ben. Can we have our next question, please\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question is coming from Kyle McNealy calling from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle McNealy: Hi, thanks very much. Just wanted to see if you could give us a sense for what drove the Wearables result and the strength there this quarter. Was it from the maybe strong iPhone attach rates or the new products that you have available that were announced this quarter, or maybe you're still getting some benefit from customers that are more willing to come into the store now and try things on versus the pandemic when that was kind of shut down?\nTim Cook: Yes. Kyle, it's Tim. The -- if you look at Wearables, we grew 10%, which we were very happy with. If you look at the individual pieces of that, Apple Watch was a contributor. And in particular, the new lineup was a contributor, including the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch Series 8 and the SE. The Ultra is -- was supply constrained and continues to be supply constrained during this quarter thus far. And so we're working hard to satisfy the demand bearing, get those products to customers. We also announced and launched the AirPods Pro in September. And the reviews for the product have just been off the charts in terms of the noise cancellation features and the sound quality. We're getting great, great reviews from there. In terms of what played the other way, the headwinds, obviously, FX was a headwind that affected Wearables, Home and Accessories, just like it affected the rest of our products and services. And we also had effect from the business in Russia, obviously, or the impact there. So that's sort of the pro and the con. The other thing that I should mention is that about two-thirds of the Apple Watches that we sold were to customers that had not previously owned an Apple Watch. And so the -- we're still very much selling to new customers here, which is very, very good for the future.\nKyle McNealy: Okay, great. One more quick one on Mac. I wanted to see if you could quantify at all how much the channel fill and how much came from satisfying back orders from the June period for Mac. We're just trying to get a sense for where the baseline is, if there's any sense you can give us on that. What would it have grown if not for those factors? Anything you can give us would be great. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes. I would just say that all three of the reasons that I gave were key in achieving the 25%. The M2 MacBook Air, the launch of the new product, the -- satisfying the back orders from the previous quarter and then filling the channel, all of those were key contributors.\nKyle McNealy: Okay, Tim. Thanks.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Kyle. Can we have our next question, please\nOperator: Yes, sir. The next question is coming from Mr. Jim Suva calling from Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thank you and it's great to see that you talked about your suppliers going carbon-neutral, something -- a small statement I really took to heart. Thank you. My question is on the Services. Could it possibly be impacted more by FX than product, meaning the Jim Suva family has Apple One and TV+ and all that, and we pay typically on annual, but then when we go into the store to buy new Watches and iPad, the price is adjusted more quickly. So could it be that Services growth was impacted a little bit more by FX and down the road, we could see growth reaccelerate, or am I just reading too much into the FX impact that could be different from Services versus product? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Jim, it's Luca. No, you're right. Obviously, the FX impact on our business depends on the geographic mix of the sales that we do. And so yes, it can be -- Services and products can have slightly different effects on foreign exchange. And so, if we look at our Services business in constant currency, we would have grown double digits. And so we're very pleased with that. As I mentioned, there were some areas that we could see some softness in digital advertising. Of course, you know that part, and gaming on the App Store was affected. But we were very happy with what we saw in terms of the behavior of our customers with the engagement with Services. And I mentioned a number of things during the prepared remarks, the fact that, obviously, that installed base is growing, that's a positive and it's a great foundation for the future. We are seeing more transacting accounts and more paid accounts, they're both growing double digits. Paid accounts are growing faster than transacting accounts, so the penetration of paid accounts is increasing. We have a great subscription business, 900 million paid subs now on the platform and growing very fast. We doubled in 3 years. So when we look at all those dynamics, that's the part that is really interesting to us because we really believe that the engine for Services growth is there and foreign exchange is a temporary thing and \u2013 but the fundamentals are very good.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Congratulations for your team.\nTejas Gala: Thanks Jim. Can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead. \nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have 2 as well. The first 1 really is around the iPhone trajectory. There's been a fair amount of focus in terms of what's going to happen to iPhone demand, given the macro worries. It would be really helpful to understand though, given the strength you're seeing, where do you think channel inventory is for iPhones today versus where it would be from a historical perspective? And do you see the channel getting to an optimal level by end of December quarter? Because evenly right now given the lead time data, it looks like your revenue trajectory in iPhones is more driven by the supply you have versus demand. So any color on the channel inventory would be helpful.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at where we ended, Amit, in the September quarter, we exited below our target inventory range on iPhone and that's -- that in and of itself is not too unusual in the quarter. We start the ramp and demand is robust and so forth. And so I wouldn't call it that abnormal from the past.\nQ \u2013 : Got it. And then I guess, Tim, you folks have been talking about digital advertising a fair bit over the last few quarters, I think. Is there any metrics, any vectors you can talk about kind of to give us a sense of how big those businesses or what vectors are you focused on? And really, if you could talk about, do you think Apple can build an advertising business at scale without sacrificing consumer privacy?\nTim Cook: So our -- first and foremost, we focus on privacy and so we would not do anything that stepped away from that. We feel that privacy is a basic fundamental human right, and so that's sort of the lens that we look at it under. Our specific advertising business is not large and relative to others and so forth. But we don't release the exact numbers on it, but it's clearly not large.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. We'll now move on to Mr. Harsh Kumar calling from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \nHarsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, thanks guys, First of all, fellows congratulations on stellar performance. There's a lot of large-cap companies that are getting ripped around, so we appreciate the steady cadence here. Tim, I wanted to ask you about inflation pressures and labor problems here in the US and globally. And maybe talk about what steps can Apple take to mitigate those? And maybe Luca, on that end, FX is becoming a pretty significant headwind. I was curious what -- if at all, if there's anything that can be done to mitigate that.\nTim Cook: I'll let Luca talk about FX. In terms of the people piece, we're focused on taking care of our teams and offering them the best benefits and best compensation so that we can empower them to do the best work of their lives. And so that's what we're focused on in terms of our teams. In terms of inflation, there's clearly wage inflation. There's inflation related to logistics as well. If you compare it to pre-pandemic kind of levels, that has not returned to pre pandemic levels by any means. And there's certain silicon components that are -- have inflationary pressure as well. And so that's not an all-inclusive list of where we see it, but it gives you some ingredients of where we see inflation pressure. And we've obviously taken that into consideration in the gross margin guidance that Luca gave earlier in the call.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. And on foreign exchange, you're right. I mean, it's obviously a very significant factor that is affecting our results, both revenue and gross margin. What do we do about situation like this, one where we have a very strong dollar? Of course, we hedge our exposures. We try to hedge them in as many places as possible around the world. For example, I think we've been probably the first company that started hedging our exposure in China several years ago. There may be a few currency, small ones, where we don't hedge because the cost is prohibitive or the market is not there. But in general, we tend to hedge because it gives us significant level of margin stability. Obviously, over time, that protection reduces because the hedges roll over and we need to buy new contracts. But that's the primary tool that we use to offset some of the FX pressure. Of course, when we launch new products, in particular, we look at the FX situation. And in some cases, for example, customers in international markets had to -- they saw some price increases when we launched the new products, which is not something that, for example, US customers have seen. And that's unfortunately the situation that we're in right now with the strong dollar. So that's the way we try to deal with that. I have to say that one of the things that we've really appreciated the most during the quarter was the fact that in spite of this very strong dollar and the difficult FX environment, we have seen very strong performance in many international markets, particularly some very large emerging markets where even in reported currencies, so in US dollars, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth in places like India, Indonesia, Mexico, Vietnam, many places where we've done incredibly well. And obviously, in local currency, those growth rates are even higher. It's important for us to look at how these markets perform in local currency because it really gives us a good sense for the customer response to our products, the engagement with our ecosystem and in general, the strength of the brand. And I have to say, in that respect, we feel very, very good about the progress that we're making in a lot of markets around the world.\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Tim and Luca. I had a follow-up. Luca, in your prepared remarks for the guidance, you mentioned that for the December quarter, you expect the performance to decelerate relative to September. So September was a year-over-year about, call it, 8%. Should I think that, that 8% number will go down on a year-over-year basis as we look at December? Maybe you could provide some color on what you're thinking. And are we still looking -- are we looking at a positive number, or are we thinking maybe that the growth rate will be negative on a year-over-year basis?\nLuca Maestri: What we said is that we're going to be decelerating from September, so September was 8%, so it's going to be a lower percentage than 8%. We're not providing guidance for the reasons that we've explained. There's a lot of uncertainty there. And so we see how the quarter progresses. Keep in mind the 10 points of exchange. Certainly, in normal times, we will be talking about very different numbers, but that's where we are right now.\nHarsh Kumar: Thank you guys.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Harsh. Can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Yes, sir. Next question is coming from Krish Sankar calling from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, either for Tim or Luca, on cash and capital allocation. Given there's some correction and valuation for some of the private and public companies, does it change your thought process on the time line to get to cash-neutral? In other words, would you be more aggressive with acquisitions, or you think holding on to more cash due to interest income becomes more attractive versus your prior investment goals? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nTim Cook: This is Tim. In terms of acquisitions, we averaged about one per month, I believe, in across fiscal year 2022. And so we're constantly looking in the market. And what's out there. And what things would be synergistic. And which things would provide either intellectual property or talent or preferably both that we would need. And so we're constantly looking at acquisitions of all sizes.\nLuca Maestri: In terms of cash deployment, obviously, we like to look at the capital return program over the long arc of time. And we have done, since the beginning of the program we've done over $550 billion of buyback at an average repurchase price of $47. So the program has been incredibly successful. We are still in a position where we have net cash. And we said all along, we want to get to cash-neutral at some point. Our cash generation has been very, very strong over the years, particularly last year. I think, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did $111 billion of free cash flow. That's up 20% year-over-year. And so we will put that capital to use for investors.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it, very helpful, Tim and Luca. And then a quick follow-up for Luca on the December guidance, thanks for the color on that. I'm just kind of curious, the extra week in the quarter, is that not helping offset some of the FX, or in other words, the 10 percentage point negative impact from FX will be much higher if that's a 13-week quarter?\nLuca Maestri: No, I wouldn't say that because those are percentages. So yeah, no, the 10 points wouldn't be different. 13 or 14 weeks would be the same.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks a lot Luca.\nEnd of Q&A:\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Krish.

We do appreciate your participation."}, {"symbol": "AAPL", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-28 17:00:00", "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q3 FY 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during the discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operation. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, Apple is reporting another record June quarter with revenue of $83 billion, which was better than we expected despite supply constraints, strong foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our business in Russia. We set June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific region. We also saw June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Indonesia and Vietnam and a near doubling of revenue in India. We saw great enthusiasm for our products and services, resulting in an all-time record for our installed base of active devices. Our supply constraints were less than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, coming in slightly below the range we discussed during our last call. We know that this is a time of significant challenge around the world for all of us confronting new variants of COVID-19, to those experiencing a prolonged humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and everyone dealing with the consequences of an uncertain economic environment. We know that much of the world is living through uneasy times, and it is all the more reason why we are working hard to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be.  Turning to iPhone. We set a June quarter record for both revenue and switchers to iPhone. With its advanced performance, capability and ease of use, customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones. And they've been raving about the iPhone 13 lineup's extraordinary camera quality with features like cinematic mode and macro photography to create eye-catching content. We were also proud to celebrate the 15th anniversary of iPhone, a device that continues to change the world in profound ways with each new innovation.  Last month, Apple unleashed a wave of innovation, including the completely redesigned MacBook Air and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro. Both of these systems are powered by M2, our next generation of Apple silicon for Mac. M2 delivers a faster CPU, GPU and neural engine along with higher memory bandwidth and new capabilities like Pro Res acceleration. And it continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon for the Mac. We continue to have supply constraints with Mac, but we're encouraged by the strong response from customers to our incredible lineup.  iPad, like Mac, continued to see strong demand during the June quarter despite ongoing supply constraints. Customers and developers have been especially excited about the new features we're bringing to iPad with iPadOS 16. This update was one of the many announcements we made at a truly extraordinary WWDC, where we shared a range of new features that give customers more control of their experience than ever before. This includes the ability to edit or delete sent messages, a new way of organizing apps on iPad and Mac, and an all-new customizable lock screen on iPhone and so much more. Today, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, MacOS Ventura and watchOS 9 are all in public beta, and we couldn't be more excited to see what our community of developers creates with them.  We unveiled new innovations and accessibility such as door detection and live captions that support users with disabilities with navigation, health, communication and more. We also announced Apple Pay Later, which gives customers more flexibility to make purchases with their Apple devices. And with our next generation of CarPlay, we're improving the driving experience with deeper integration into vehicle hardware, allowing drivers to control their music, change the temperature and monitor their fuel levels, all from a single integrated platform.  In the Wearables, Home and Accessories category, the innovation infused across our products continues to win over new customers. Apple Watch remains a great way for health-conscious customers to track their overall wellness and fitness. And we're bringing them even more data about their workouts, sleep cycles and medications with updates soon to arrive on watchOS 9. We were also pleased to get FDA approval for a new feature that will let users with irregular heart rhythms track the time they spend in Afib.  Turning to Services. Customers continue to engage enthusiastically with our content across news, fitness, music, gaming and more. Services revenue rose to $19.6 billion, a June quarter record and a 12% increase year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. We're proud of how Apple TV+ productions like Severance and Black Bird have captured the popular imagination, and we're looking forward to more exceptional content developed by extraordinary creators throughout the year.  In 2.5 years since launch, Apple TV+ has now earned 250 wins and over 1,100 award nominations and counting. Just this month, we learned that Apple TV+ earned 52 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles. In our last call, I mentioned Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+, which is already delighting baseball fans. And last month, we announced a 10-year deal to present Major League soccer matches around the world, giving global soccer fans a whole new way of viewing their favorite sport.  One of the best parts of WWDC was welcoming developers to Apple Park while continuing to connect with developers all over the world. This year, we had an incredible group of developers and more opportunities to learn from one another than ever before. It was a truly special experience and a reminder of the economic miracle the App Store represents.  We are proud of the fact that the iOS app economy supports more than 2.2 million jobs here in the United States and many more around the world. It's been wonderful to see earnings by small developers more than double over the past 2 years. And as we're supporting developers, we're also doing our part to protect customers. In 2021, we prevented nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions by stopping over 1.6 million risky and vulnerable apps and app updates.  Now I want to turn to retail. This quarter, we opened the doors to Apple's first store in the Hubei province in China, welcoming the community to a beautiful new space. And earlier today, we opened Apple Brompton Road, our fifth store in Central London. We also expanded today at Apple Creative Studios to reach even more young creatives from underrepresented communities to help them realize their potential and bring their best ideas to life.  I'd like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to our team members working in Apple Stores, customer care centers and channel partner stores and to our Apple Care teams for their incredible work supporting customers wherever they are.  Creating innovative products and services that enrich people's lives is our mission. Leading with our values and everything we do gives that mission purpose. That includes a commitment to the environment where we continue our aggressive pursuit of our 2030 goals. It includes our focus on diversity and inclusion, where we are committed as ever to making progress.  And it includes our work to promote racial equity and justice. We recently announced that the Global Equity Innovation Hub, in partnership with Cal State Northridge, will provide new community grants to Hispanic-serving institutions to help the next generation of creators and innovators build skills and pursue high-demand careers in STEM. We also celebrated the graduation of the inaugural class of our Developer Academy in Detroit from a program designed to give students the skills they need to pursue jobs in the thriving iOS app economy.  Leading with our values also means leading with a steadfast commitment to privacy and security. Last month, we announced the introduction of passkey, a next-generation credential that's intended to replace passwords. A passkey can't be phished nor can it be stolen by hackers in a data breach because the information is stored on your device and your device alone. And as part of our effort to combat targeted attacks against the highest risk targets like journalists and human rights activists, we introduced Lockdown Mode, which is designed to protect those most at risk of sophisticated digital attacks.  And we're committed to doing our part to address the housing crisis across California. To date, we have deployed more than $1.3 billion to a number of initiatives, including ones that provide financial assistance to low and moderate income first-time home buyers develop new affordable housing and help support vulnerable populations.  This quarter has ultimately been a reflection of our resilience and our optimism. As we look forward, we're clear-eyed about the uncertainty in the macro environment. Yet we remain ever focused on the same vision that has guided us from the beginning. We strive every day to be a place where imagination ignites innovation like nowhere else, where good people come together to achieve great things, where customers are the center of everything we do. And we'll continue to execute on that vision as we always have, led by a focus on excellence and a desire to leave the world better than we found it. And with that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report June quarter financial results that continue to demonstrate our ability to innovate across hardware, software and services while operating our business effectively during very challenging economic circumstances. We set a June quarter revenue record of $83 billion, up 2% year-over-year despite supply constraints, over 300 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our business in Russia. Around the world, we set new June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific. On the product side, revenue was $63.4 billion with a June quarter revenue record for iPhone. During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continue to grow well, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our Services set a June quarter revenue record of $19.6 billion, up 12% over a year ago, with all-time revenue records in the Americas and the rest of Asia Pacific and June quarter records in Europe and Greater China.  We also achieved June quarter revenue records in each major Services category, including all-time revenue records for Music, Cloud Services, Apple Care and Payment Services. Company gross margin was 43.3%, down 40 basis points from last quarter as seasonal loss of leverage and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by favorable mix.  Products gross margin was 34.5%, down 190 basis points sequentially, mainly driven by seasonal loss of leverage, mix and FX. Services gross margin was 71.5%, down 110 basis points sequentially due to a different mix and foreign exchange. Net income was $19.4 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.20, while operating cash flow of $22.9 billion was a June quarter record.  Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 3% year-over-year to a June quarter record of $40.7 billion despite foreign exchange headwinds as customer response to our iPhone 13 family continue to be strong. We set June quarter records in both developed and emerging markets. And the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies as a result of this level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer loyalty. In fact, the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. We also attracted a record number of switchers for the June quarter, with strong double-digit year-over-year growth.  For Mac, we generated revenue of $7.4 billion despite supply constraints and negative effects. We continue to be excited about our long-term opportunity with Mac and redefining the PC experience with our relentless innovation. Our investment focus on Mac has helped drive significant growth in our installed base, which reached an all-time high during the June quarter as nearly half of the customers purchasing a Mac were new to the product.  iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year due to supply constraints and negative foreign exchange. Customer response to our iPad lineup continue to be strong across consumer, education and enterprise markets around the world. And the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of the customers during the quarter being new to the product.  Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year as we faced foreign exchange headwinds, different launch timing for Home and Accessories products and supply constraints as well as the overall macroeconomic environment. Despite this, our installed base of devices in the category hit a new all-time record, thanks to very strong customer loyalty and high new tool rates. For example, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.  Services had a June quarter revenue record of $19.6 billion, up 12% despite almost 500 basis points of FX headwinds as well as impacts from our business in Russia and the macroeconomic environment. We set June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets and set all-time records in many countries around the world, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Korea and India.  The record level of performance of our Services portfolio during the June quarter reflects the strength of our ecosystem on many fronts: First, our installed base has continued to grow, reaching an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category. We also saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Our transacting accounts, paid accounts and accounts with paid subscriptions all grew double digits year-over-year.  And paid subscriptions showed very strong growth. We now have more than 860 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 160 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current Services offerings, from a constant flow of new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to great new features we recently announced for iCloud and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love.  In the enterprise market, our customers are increasingly investing in Apple products as a strategy to attract and retain talent. Bank of America is providing iPhones to all of its financial advisers so they can instantly access client information and provide timely wealth management advice from anywhere. Wipro, another large global enterprise customer, is investing in MacBook Air with M1 as a competitive advantage when recruiting new graduates globally, thanks to its superior performance and lower total cost of ownership. And with the new M2 chip powering MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro, we expect more customers to make Mac available to their entire workforce.  Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $179 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3 billion in maturing debt while increasing commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was nearly $60 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned over $28 billion to shareholders during the June quarter. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21.7 billion through open market repurchases of 143 million Apple shares. We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time.  As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.  Overall, we believe our year-over-year revenue growth will accelerate during the September quarter compared to the June quarter despite approximately 600 basis points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. On the product side, we expect supply constraints to be lower than what we experienced during the June quarter. Specifically related to Services, we expect revenue to grow but decelerate from the June quarter due to macroeconomic factors and foreign exchange.  We expect gross margin to be between 41.5% and 42.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.9 billion and $13.1 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative [indiscernible] impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2022, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess two from my side. Maybe to start on the gross margin discussion, Luca. You said that implying gross margin will be down I think, 130, 140 basis points sequentially and down a bit year-over-year as well in September. Maybe just what are the puts and takes here. And then very specifically, can you actually just call what the FX headwinds are embedded in the September quarter gross margin, that would be helpful.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit. We're guiding 41.5% to 42.5%. On a sequential basis, the decline is expected to be driven by, as you mentioned, foreign exchange but also mix, which will be partially offset by better leverage. We expect foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis to be 50 basis points. If you look at it from a year-over-year standpoint, we are in the ballpark of a year ago in spite of the fact that foreign exchange is going to be 130 basis points negative to a year ago. So clearly, foreign exchange is something that is affecting us but we think we're navigating that fairly well.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. And then if I could just ask Tim the question. There's a lot of macro worries and high inflation impacting consumer demand. Certainly doesn't seem to be very visible in your performance and your expectations. So I'm wondering if you talk about, are you seeing any implications from recession fears or inflation fears to your end demand? And really just related to that, wearables decline was notable. Is that where you would typically see initial signs of consumer softening perhaps?\nTim Cook: Thanks for the question. If you -- I'm not an economist and so I'll sort of narrow my comments to what we saw in the business. And if you look at the June quarter, we do believe that we saw macroeconomic headwinds that impacted our business and our results. And so one of those is clearly the FX, which Luca has mentioned, that was over 300 basis points on year-over-year growth rates.  When you look at the product categories, on iPhone, there was no obvious evidence of macroeconomic impact during the June quarter besides FX, obviously. Mac and iPad were so gated by supply that we didn't have enough product to test the demand. And Wearables, Home and Accessories, as you mentioned and as Luca mentioned, we did see some impact there that we would attribute to a macroeconomic environment.  When you then look at Services, there were some Services that were impacted, for example, like digital advertising was clearly impacted by the macroeconomic environment. And so it's a mixed bag in terms of what we believe that we saw. Overall, we are very happy with the results. And when you think about the number of challenges in the quarter, we feel really good about the growth that we put up for the quarter.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar: Yes. First of all, congratulations. As these are tough times, you guys are putting up tremendous results so we appreciate that as investors. My question is, when I look at your Services business, I see a $20 billion business on a quarterly basis. And you keep adding -- as a company, you keep adding very interesting and transformative features such as payments, something like that every year.  So I'm struggling to find a good way to think about how to model the growth of this business, considering that you add innovative features. So now that it's fairly matured as a business, what would be a good way for us to think about as investors to model the Services business? And I do have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Well, as you know, we don't provide guidance past the current quarter. But I think the way to think about it, certainly the way we think about it is that there's a number of levers in our Services business to take into account. The first one is installed base. Installed base is the engine for our company and it continues to grow. As I mentioned, it has reached an all-time high across every geographic segment, across every product category. And so that's very important.  Then the second lever is the customer engagement. And we know that our customers are getting more and more engaged over time. Transacting accounts, paid accounts, paid subscriptions are growing, so the level of engagement continues to grow.  And then as you mentioned, the breadth and the quality of the services that we offer tends to grow over time. So these are all things that tend to help us over the long term. If you go back and you look at our growth rates over a number of quarters now, they've always been very good. Of course, the macro environment can have an impact on this business. Tim has mentioned, for example, digital advertising can be affected at times.  During COVID, some of the compares have been a bit lumpy because there have been lockdowns and reopenings and so on. So it's very difficult to talk about a steady state growth rate for our Services business. But when we look at the entirety of what we are doing in the Services space, we feel very good about the future of the business.\nHarsh Kumar: Luca, very helpful. And for my follow-up, valuations have come down in the last 18 months or so for things and companies and targets that you might look at. I guess, particularly in the Services area, would there be an appetite on behalf of Apple to accelerate the growth of its Services business by looking at external products to acquire?\nTim Cook: We always look and we ask ourselves if it's -- how strategic it is, and we never buy just to buy or buy just for revenue purposes. But we would buy something that is strategic for us. To date, we have concentrated on smaller IP and people acquisitions. But I wouldn't rule anything out for the future, and obviously, we are constantly surveilling the market.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: I have two as well. Maybe Tim, if I start with you, I think there's a debate in the market that if you look back over time, there's been a 3-year cadence to iPhone cycles. We're 2 years into your 5G iPhone evolution. You're on track to grow units in '21 and '22. That implies there could be some pressure next year as upgrade rates slow. But your comments really suggest no slowdown. You're seeing double-digit growth in customers new to iPhone. So can you just walk us through some of the various factors you believe are driving this continued iPhone strength? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Today, the product and the innovation within the product that is driving it. And of course, the other key variables are some things that Luca mentioned earlier where the size of the installed base has been growing significantly. We also, just in this quarter, the June quarter, set a June quarter record for switchers with strong double-digit growth. And so this is fueling the additional installed base even more.  And we continue to execute across some significant geographies where there's a very low penetration of iPhone. Some of those were called out in the opening remarks between Indonesia and Vietnam and India, where we did quite well, and iPhone tends to be the engine for those markets, particularly at the beginning of creating the market there for Apple products. And so we're really looking at all of these things from the installed base to the number of switchers to the geographic distribution.  Of course, the most important thing for us is to maintain an incredible customer satisfaction and loyalty from the customers. And we're really pleased that it's currently at 98% for the latest iPhones. And so those are the things that underpin it. 5G has been an accelerant. And the 5G penetration, particularly if you look at it globally, is still quite low. In some geographies, it's obviously higher, but around the world, 5G penetration is still low. And so I think there's reason to be optimistic.\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe, Luca, for you. As we move from the June to the September quarter, maybe can you dig a level deeper and kind of help us understand some of the moving pieces in the Services business? Meaning where do you think we could see an acceleration or maybe a deceleration? And should we still expect double-digit growth? If you could just frame that for us, that would be great.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Erik. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we expect some deceleration from the 12% that we've had in the June quarter. Keep in mind, we're going to see, on a year-over-year basis, 600 basis points, 6% impact from foreign exchange so that is a big element for us. Also keep in mind that we're still lapping the impact of our business in Russia in these numbers. And Tim mentioned that there are some pockets of weakness, primarily in digital advertising that we will need to work through. But at the same time, our Services business a year ago grew a lot and so also the compare is a bit challenging. So we don't have a very specific number to give out today. Of course, we expect to grow. We will see how the quarter develops.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Richard Kramer with Arete Research.\nRichard Kramer: Tim, you cited growth in Apple apps in the past, and clearly, the privacy policies you've taken have really reshaped the mobile ad market. Can you give us a sense of how you see Apple's role as an ad network and perhaps helping developers to monetize not just app sales but also growing ad monetization over time?\nTim Cook: Yes. Richard, we view privacy as a fundamental human right. And so what we try to do with all of our features on privacy is put the decision back at the user where we believe it belongs as to whether they want to share their data or not. And so that was what was behind application tracking transparency and a number of other features. We're trying to empower the user to own their data and make their own choices.  In terms of us selling ads, we have a search ad business across the App Store that we believe represents a great way for discovery for small and large developers. And so I see that we play a role in that.\nRichard Kramer: And then maybe my follow-up for Luca. Can you give us a sense, especially now that you're launching Pay Later, what steps you might be taking to improve affordability of Apple products? We know that it's going to be a tight time economically for people around the world. And how do you see the evolution of various payment plans out of the -- you see in the U.S. now into other markets, especially emerging markets?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. I mean, obviously, affordability is a very important topic for us. It's been for many years. Buy now, pay later is the latest that we are doing on this front. Fundamentally, we are working on 2 major initiatives for affordability. One is installment plans and installment plans have become more widespread around the world, not only here in the United States but in most markets, particularly in emerging markets. Incredibly important in terms of reducing the affordability threshold.  And trading programs. Trading programs are available in a number of markets. We can do better in other markets. They're incredibly important because the residual value of our products is a huge differentiator for our users. After they use our devices, they can bring them back and they retain much more value than other platforms. And therefore, it's important for us to raise that awareness. And so we will continue to expand those programs around the world. So installments and trade-ins, very, very important on affordability.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS.\nDavid Vogt: I just wanted to circle back on sort of the macro and sort of the demand signals that you're seeing versus sort of the supply chains that you're facing. I know that there's been a couple of U.S. carriers that have talked about some of their customers having some difficulty paying bills. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you saw sort of the record number of switchers in the quarter. So just wanted to kind of get a sense for what you're seeing in that particular channel without naming a specific customer. And are you seeing any sort of issues from a spin-down effect maybe because customers are having some difficulty because of inflation? And then I have a follow-up on Macs.\nTim Cook: On the -- from an aggregate point of view, looking at it worldwide, looking at the data on iPhone for the June quarter, there's not obvious evidence in there that there's a macroeconomic headwind. I'm not saying that there's not one. I'm saying that the data doesn't show it where we can clearly see that in the Wearables, Home and Accessories area. And so I would differentiate those 2.\nDavid Vogt: Great. And then on the Mac business, I know that you are severely supply chain constrained. But is there a way to kind of think about the impact of the market overall on the Mac business versus the supply chain? It sounds like -- I guess, it sounds like it's almost effectively 100% supply chain constrained, but we're obviously hearing, like I'm sure you guys are seeing, anecdotal evidence and some quantifiable evidence that the broader PC market is slowing.  And I think about 90 days ago, you were pretty confident with the new M2 chip that you could continue to grow throughout a potential drawdown in that particular market. Do you still feel that way? And if you can kind of share how you're thinking about the different sort of components of your growth versus the market.\nTim Cook: Yes, I wouldn't want to project into this quarter. But for last quarter, what we saw was the -- when the COVID restrictions hit in the Shanghai corridor, we lost the primary source of supply for Mac units. And that was either running at a reduced rate or down completely for the majority of the quarter. And so it was a very big impact to the Mac business.  We felt good, frankly, that we were able to, by the end of the quarter, get this back to where we were down 10 points. But the negative 10 I would classify as being driven by supply. And of course, FX feeds into this as well because of the translation issues around the world. There's also some impact because of the business in Russia. But those are the 3 kind of reasons that I would tell you.  In terms of testing the demand, you can't really test the demand unless you have the supply. And we were so far from that last quarter that we have an estimate of what we believe demand was. But it is an estimate. We recognize how the industry is doing. We think that we've got a great story with the Mac with getting M1 out and now M2 out. We have a very, very strong offering for the back-to-school season and we'll see how we do this quarter. We'll report back in October.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\nBenjamin Bollin: Tim, I was hoping you could share a little bit more about how you're thinking about the supply headwinds. You said less severe or less worse supply challenges into September. I'm interested when you think you find balance across products. And also, any thoughts on how or when that might influence replenishment of supply into your retail channels?\nTim Cook: To give you a little more color on what we saw in the June quarter, we came in slightly below, from a constraint point of view, the $4 billion number that we had put, at the 4 to 8 are the low end of that range. And the majority of that constraint last quarter was coming out of the COVID restrictions that occurred, that resulted in plant closures and plants running at less than full utilization for some amount of the quarter, in some cases, the majority of the quarter.  And then the other component that is the minority part of it is the silicon shortage that has affected our results for several quarters now. If you look into the future, the silicon shortage, we're not forecasting when that will end. We think that in the aggregate, our constraint numbers for the September quarter will be less than they were in the June quarter. But of the 2 -- there are these 2 components, and of course, we're optimistic about the COVID restriction piece of this.\nBenjamin Bollin: Okay. The other item. Tim, any thoughts on how you're thinking strategy is evolving with respect to progress in AR, VR in your existing products? Anything you're learning about content or how you're thinking about that opportunity?\nTim Cook: We're thrilled right now to have over 14,000 ARKit apps in the App Store. And they're providing incredible AR experiences for millions of people. And that's utilizing iPhone and iPad. And of course, we are in the business of innovation so we're always exploring new and emerging technologies. But I wouldn't want to say anything beyond that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Luca, you mentioned revenues to accelerate year-over-year overall in September versus your June growth rate. Would you say that it would be reasonable to assume normal quarter-on-quarter seasonality of about $7 billion or so? Or would you say there are additional puts and takes this time around that could drive upside and downside to that? I know you noted 600 bps year-over-year on FX as potentially one of those. But maybe help us think through, on a sequential basis, how much of a normal versus abnormal seasonality we should expect? And I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Wamsi, as you know, as we said earlier, we're not providing guidance because of all the uncertainty out there. But we have given a few data points. So one of them, which you've mentioned, approximately 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange. I mean, you do a rough math, it's around $5 billion. That's a big number right there that is going to affect us, that we are having some impact from the situation in Russia and that is obviously different from normal seasonality as well. Our supply constraints, as Tim just said, are going to be lower than what we've seen in the June quarter but they're still going to be there. So when you look at those 3 headwinds and you combine them with the acceleration that we talked about, we feel that, that is pretty remarkable.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, Luca. And Tim, I wanted to follow up on your comment about the macro impact that you've seen on wearables. Your wearables portfolio is probably at the lowest ASP range across your product portfolio. As you're giving this guidance or directional guidance here, how much of an impact are you assuming in potentially any macro-related slowdowns across the rest of the portfolio? Why would investors not think that it would be prudent to assume some sort of creep-up of some of these -- some of the hesitation maybe that the macro environment is driving, particularly as it pertains to your higher ASP products?\nTim Cook: Yes. Let me expand a little bit on Wearables, Home and Accessories so that I clearly communicate what we saw. We saw sort of a cocktail of headwinds on Wearables, Home and Accessories. We saw FX, which we've talked about. We saw supply constraints, which we've talked about. Of course, there was an impact from the business in Russia. But in addition to those things, which -- those things affected all the products to some degree, we also had a different launch timing for certain home and accessory products. Like in the year-ago quarter, I think, had AirTag in it. That's just 1 example of something that announced last year that didn't announce this -- that we didn't have a comparable announcement this year.  And in -- so in addition to those 4 items, we believe, based on the data, that there was also a macroeconomic environment hit. And whether or not that is because they're lower ASPs versus the higher ASPs of a phone, I can't tell you that. I can just tell you that looking at the numbers, there does appear to be headwinds in addition to the 4 items that we can articulate and we believe those to be macroeconomic headwinds.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. And congrats on the results in this tough macro. I guess I wanted to start with China smartphone market here a bit. Tim, I thought you said in response to earlier question that you haven't really seen a material impact from the macro on iPhone yet. But wondering, did you see an impact of the COVID lockdowns there on demand itself? Or was there a snapback fall in that? If you can comment about the sort of exit run rate that you saw in that market, following the COVID shutdowns ending there. And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes, both things are true. We did see a lower demand based on the COVID lockdowns in the cities the COVID lockdowns affected. And we did see a rebound in those same cities toward the end of the quarter in the June time frame. And in particular, in the run-up to June 18, which as you know, is a major shopping holiday in China. We think that the net of that was still a negative, but some of it did rebound by June time frame. The restrictions begin to come off toward the beginning of June, if my memory is correct.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And for my follow-up, I know you said you don't want to sort of predict the macro here or be an economist. But if I go back and look at the sort of OpEx for the last few years, you've been increasing that by a double-digit percentage. And just given the uncertainty that you've talked about in the macro further on this call a lot, how are you thinking about sort of that investment base going forward? Are you trying to look at areas that where you can sort of pull back? I mean, just in terms of how you're preparing for the uncertainty is I guess the question.\nTim Cook: We believe in investing through the downturn. And so we'll continue to hire people and invest in areas, but we are being more deliberate in doing so in recognition of the realities of the environment.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJames Suva: While I'm calling you on my iPhone 13 Max Pro and loving it, I just wanted to ask you, though, with replacement cycles, have you noticed any change now that we've been through like 2.5 years of COVID where people upgrading at a different rate and kind of post COVID, hopefully, upgrade cycles or replacement cycles, how we should kind of think about that? Obviously, when I drop and break my phone, I replace it immediately. But a normal replacement, have they changed at all? Any insights from that would be great.\nTim Cook: It's challenging to measure the replacement cycle at any point in time with exact precision, and so I'm going to punt on the question a bit. However, our key task is to make a product that everybody loves and that they want to trade in their current phone to get. And so that's what we are focused on is innovating like crazy and giving somebody something that they really want and see themselves using.\nJames Suva: Okay, that makes sense. Well, then maybe I can ask Luca a question more on the gross margins. As you look ahead, the supply chain issues, expedited shipping and all of that, do you think probably the September quarter is kind of the worst of FX and all those headwinds and things? Or is there a little bit of timing delays due to your contractual purchase commitments that you do, that maybe your suppliers are looking at higher costs and you're benefiting from some lower contracts or maybe that has already caught up? If you could give us some insights on the kind of longer-term nature of the directions or the gross margin impacts.\nLuca Maestri: Jim, I would say we provide guidance for the current quarter. But if we look ahead, there's always a couple of elements in gross margin that are a bit outside of our control and we need to be mindful of that. One of them is the foreign exchange environment. That is having an impact already for the September quarter, had an impact on June. And obviously, strong dollar tends to be a headwind for us. As you know, we have a hedging program and so we mitigate that impact. But over time, those hedges roll off and so it becomes more challenging for us. We'll see what happens with foreign exchange rates over time. That is going to be a variable that we need to track. The other one that has an impact on the aggregate gross margin is our mix of products and services. As you know, they have different margin profiles for very different reasons, different businesses, even different accounting treatment at times. And so that is also something that we will need to track over time. What matters to us, I think it goes back to Tim was saying earlier, is we want to make sure that people love our products and services, and we want all of them to be equally successful in the marketplace.  Certainly, as you've seen over the last year, we've had a significant expansion in gross margins in spite of very difficult economic circumstances from COVID to inflation, interest rates going up and our margins have expanded. From a commodity standpoint, I think you were asking a question around components. Commodities are behaving okay. We're seeing some price pressure on some silicon components. But other than that, we've -- actually commodities are behaving well.\nJames Suva: Congratulations to you and all your team members.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.\nKrish Sankar: And Tim, I apologize, it's also macro-related. You mentioned that it impacted digital advertising within Services. I'm just kind of curious, if the macro does worsen, do you worry about subscriber growth, App Store purchases, et cetera? And conversely, are there any parts of the Service business that you consider recession-proof, like maybe a buy now, pay later or something else? And then I have a quick follow-up for Luca.\nTim Cook: We have incorporated all of our thoughts in the guidance that Luca gave, which says that we think in the aggregate, we're going to accelerate revenues in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter and will decelerate on the Services side. And so we see the digital advertising cloud, if you will, continuing in the current quarter.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on the lockdown in China during the June quarter. Do you actually see any noticeable negative effects on your App Store revenue for the region or any positive effects like maybe more gaming downloads?\nTim Cook: China had very good results on Services last quarter. And so they grew strong double digit better than the company average, and they set a new June quarter revenue record during the quarter.\nTejas Gala: Thank you.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Apple is proud to report another record quarter, with a March quarter revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9% from a year ago and better than we anticipated. iPhone, Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories had their best ever March quarter and Services set an all-time record on the strength of subscription growth over the past year. Before I get into details, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Ukraine. We're continuing to do everything we can to support our teams in the region and we are donating to humanitarian efforts on the ground. We've also committed to donating products to support refugees arriving here in the United States. I also want to speak to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. We are excited to be welcoming employees back to the offices in the US and Europe. At the same time, we are monitoring COVID-related disruptions in China. Our thoughts are with all those in the path of the virus and we remain as committed as ever to doing our part to help protect people and their communities. These times remind us that we cannot know what the future may hold. But they remind us too, that technology infused with humanity makes a real difference in the world. And that's where our focus has remained, on driving the innovations that can enrich people's lives. Throughout the quarter, Apple continued its streak of unparalleled innovation at an unmatched pace. With Apple Silicon our teams are pushing the limits of what we once thought possible and we are seeing leaps and bounds in performance and efficiency. Last month we announced another breakthrough with M1 Ultra, the world's most powerful chip for a personal computer. The incredible customer response to our M1-powered Macs helped propel a 15% year-over-year increase in revenue, despite supply constraints. We now have our most powerful Mac lineup ever, with the addition of the entirely new Mac Studio. Paired with the new studio display, a 5K resolution display equipped with its own A13 Bionic chip, this new desktop and display transform any workspace into a creative powerhouse. As we release the groundbreaking M1 Ultra, we also expanded our iPhone offerings adding two beautiful green finishes to the iPhone 13 lineup and introducing the new 5G-enabled iPhone SE, which is great for our existing users who want a smaller iPhone and a great value for people buying an iPhone for the first time. They love how much power and performance we've injected into such an affordable device and rave about its incredible camera and its lightning fast speeds. In the March quarter, iPhone revenue grew 5% over the previous year despite a challenging compare as we saw strong demand from our customers for the iPhone 13 family. And with the all-new iPad Air supercharged by M1, iPad brings more power and more versatility across the entire iPad lineup. For customers around the world, iPad continues to be essential for education, creativity and entertainment. That's why we're continuing to see such a strong demand for iPad even while navigating the significant supply constraint we predicted at the start of the quarter. Turning to Wearables Home and Accessories, we are pleased to see these products continue to delight our users growing 12% year-over-year. Customers are enthusiastically taking charge of their health with Apple Watch Series 7 and Apple Watch SE. The rich sound, beautiful colors and compact design of HomePod mini continue to make it a hit with customers. And there's still no better companion to Apple Music than AirPods with spatial audio that transforms the way we listen putting our customers right in the center of the music. The seamless integration of hardware software and services is at the center of our work and philosophy at Apple. Apple Services are designed to be easy to use with expert curation that brings our users compelling content from talented developers, creators, storytellers and artists. These principles are reflected in all of the services we've developed which continue to generate incredible enthusiasm from our customers. Services revenue rose to $19.8 billion in the March quarter reflecting a 17% increase from a year ago. We were especially excited to cheer on CODA as it won the Academy Award for Best Picture making Apple TV+ the first streaming service to win in this category. We were honored to be stewards of this incredibly powerful deeply moving film. In a little over two years Apple TV+ shows and movies have earned over 240 awards and more than 960 nominations from Severance to WeCrashed to Pachinko new Apple originals are connecting with audiences and earning praise from critics. We're also winning over sports fans with Friday Night Baseball, which debuted earlier this month and They Call Me Magic, a four-part documentary that premiered last week tracing the life of the iconic Magic Johnson. Fitness+ is helping users channel their inner athlete with a range of workout routines for any fitness level. We recently introduced a postpartum routine designed by mothers for mothers. And with our Apple heart and movement study, we are helping researchers glean new insights into cardiovascular fitness. As our products and services entertain customers and help them stay healthy, we're also working to make their lives easier. Arizona for example is the first state to enable its citizens to securely add their driver's license and state IDs to Apple Wallet. More states in the territory of Puerto Rico will soon follow. We've also announced plans to introduce Tap to Pay on iPhone a simple and secure way for businesses to accept contactless payments launching across the US later this year. To meet the needs of customers wherever they are, our Apple retail teams are constantly adapting to better serve them. We opened a new store in the United Arab Emirates this quarter at a unique waterfront location with panoramic views of the Abu Dhabi skyline. And earlier this month we opened a new store in Korea, our third and largest store in the heart of Seoul. And across the US we marked the return of in-person today at Apple Sessions with a special program featuring music from pop icon Lady Gaga.  I'd like to thank our team members working in Apple stores, customer care centers, channel partner stores and our Apple Care teams for bringing customers the best of Apple. As we look to the environment, we are making good progress on our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality across our products and supply chain by 2030. Through our Green Bonds program, we're investing in breakthrough technologies like low-carbon aluminum which we will be integrating into the new iPhone SE.  And we were pleased to announce recently that we've nearly doubled the number of our top suppliers who have committed to accelerating the transition to clean energy. We are also investing in renewable energy projects in communities most impacted by climate change around the world. As we do our part to protect our planet, we're also prioritizing people. As part of our long-standing commitment to inclusion and diversity, we're continuing to build a better, stronger Apple, rooted in a culture where everyone belongs.  Last month we published an update on the progress we've made with inclusion and diversity at Apple. We've hired more women than ever into leadership roles. And in the US nearly 60% of all leadership openings were filled by people from underrepresented communities in 2021. We also recently announced a $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund that will help workers in our supply chain discover additional educational opportunities and build new skills.  And through our Racial Equity and Justice initiative, we're continuing to advance our work to support underrepresented communities and help build a more just and equitable world. Before I hand it over to Luca, I want to acknowledge the challenges we are seeing from supply chain disruptions driven by both COVID and silicon shortages to the devastation from the war in Ukraine.  We are not immune to these challenges, but we have great confidence in our teams, in our products and services and in our strategy. Fundamentally our work is about making technology that enriches people's lives and unlocks the full creative potential of humanity. And though the twists and turns of the future may be uncertain what is certain is that we will never stop striving to be a force for good in the world in everything we do and everything we are.  With that I'll turn it over to Luca. \nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the March quarter during which we set a revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year. We also set new March quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and in Greater China.  On the product side, revenue was $77.5 billion, up 7% over a year ago and a March quarter record. We grew in each of our product categories except iPad, which remains significantly supply constrained throughout the quarter. And we set March quarter records for iPhone, Mac and Wearables Home and Accessories. This level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer satisfaction and loyalty, helped our installed base of active devices, reach an all-time high for all major product categories, as well as geographic segments. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $19.8 billion, up 17% over a year ago, with March quarter records in every geographic segment and services category. Company gross margin was 43.7%, down 10 basis points from last quarter. A seasonal loss of leverage and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 36.4%, down 200 basis points sequentially, mainly driven by seasonal loss of leverage and FX. Services gross margin was 72.6%, up 20 basis points sequentially due to a different mix. Operating cash flow of $28.2 billion, net income of $25 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.52 were all March quarter records. These strong March quarter results capped a record first half of the fiscal year in the midst of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We generated over $220 billion in revenue growing 10% year-over-year and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac, Wearables Home and Accessories and Services. These record sales results drove strong double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories during the March quarter. iPhone revenue grew 5% year-over-year to a March quarter record of $50.6 billion despite supply constraints. Thanks to our continued strong customer response to our iPhone 13 family and the launch of our new iPhone SE. We set March quarter records in both developed and emerging markets and the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for the iPhone 13 family. As a result of this level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer loyalty, the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies. For Mac, revenue of $10.4 billion was a March quarter record despite supply constraints with 15% year-over-year growth, driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Pro. As Tim mentioned earlier, our continued innovation and investment in Apple Silicon has clearly shown in our Mac results as the last seven quarters have been the best seven quarter ever for Mac. Our investment focus on Mac has also helped drive significant activity in our growing installed base. In fact, we had a March quarter record for upgraders, while at the same time, nearly half of the customers purchasing Mac were new to the product. iPad revenue was $7.6 billion, down 2% year-over-year due to continued supply constraints. Customer response to our iPad lineup including our new M1-powered iPad Air, remains very strong and our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter, with over half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter being new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories set a March quarter record of $8.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. And we set March quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets. In particular, our Wearables business has doubled in three years and is mainly the size of a Fortune 100 business, as we continue to attract many customers who are new to Wearables. For instance, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Turning to Services. As I mentioned we reached an all-time revenue record of $19.8 billion, up 17%, with all-time records for the App Store, Music, Cloud Services and Apple Care and March quarter records for video, advertising and payment services. These impressive results reflect the impact of our continued investment in improving and expanding our Services portfolio and the positive momentum that we're seeing on many fronts. First, our installed base has continued to grow, reaching an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Our transacting accounts, paid accounts and accounts with paid subscriptions, all reached all-time highs during the March quarter in every geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continued to show very strong growth. We now have more than 825 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 165 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, as Tim highlighted before, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current service offerings while launching new services. In the enterprise market, many businesses and government organizations continue to turn to Apple for the latest technologies, to deliver innovative services to customers and employees. In March, Alaska Airlines began to replace the conventional airport self-service kiosks with iPad Pros for faster passenger check-in and self bag drop. Also, last month, the Western Australia Police Force completed the world's first commercial deployment of CarPlay across their entire fleet of vehicles, to complement the iPhone 13 issued to each officer. This allows officers to access critical information faster on the road and enhance public safety for the community. We also unveiled the general availability of Apple Business Essentials in the US, adding a new subscription services designed to help small businesses manage every aspect of their Apple device life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. As we continue to generate very strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.8 billion in maturing debt, while increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $73 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, during the March quarter. This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $22.9 billion through open market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 5 million shares in the final settlement of our 18th ASR. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral, overtime. We're also raising our dividend by 5% to $0.23 a share and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near-term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights, based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We believe our year-over-year revenue performance during the June quarter will be impacted by a number of factors. Supply constraints caused by COVID-related disruptions and industry-wide silicon shortages are impacting our ability to meet customer demand for our products. We expect these constraints to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion which is substantially larger than what we experienced during the March quarter. The COVID-related disruptions are also having some impact on customer demand in China. With respect to foreign exchange, we expect it to be a nearly 300 basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth rate. Additionally, we paused, all sales in Russia during the March quarter. This will impact our year-over-year growth rate by approximately 150 basis points. Specifically related to Services, we expect to continue to grow double-digits, but decelerate from our March quarter performance, due to some of the factors I just described. We expect gross margin to be between 42% and 43%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.7 billion and $12.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on May 12th 2022 to shareholders of record as of May 9th, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Absolutely. We'll take our first question from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKaty Huberty: Yes. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. A couple of macro-related questions, just given everything that's going on in the market, the first is on how you're thinking about consumer spending, as we see more stock market volatility, rising interest rates, inflation. What metrics are you watching either internal to your business or external at the macro level to understand whether you'll ultimately start to see some demand impact particularly on the product side of your business? And then, I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Katy, hi, it's Tim. We're obviously monitoring our daily sales very closely. From an inflation point of view, we are seeing inflation. It is or was evident in our gross margin last quarter and in our OpEx last quarter and it is assumed in the guidance that Luca gave for this quarter as well. So we're definitely seeing some level of inflation that I think everybody is seeing.\nKaty Huberty: And how are \u2013 just as a follow-up to that how are you thinking about how that might impact the consumers in your business and whether it influences their ability to purchase at the same level?\nTim Cook: Well we're monitoring that closely and we've sort of \u2013 but right now our main focus frankly speaking is on the supply side.\nKaty Huberty: Okay. And as it relates to that in China, how should we think about lockdowns from an impact on supply and an impact on demand? And what products in your portfolio should we expect to be most impacted? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. Good question. For Q2 so the quarter that we just finished, the restrictions in China had not started yet. And so Q2, we did have supply constraints. They were significantly lower than what we had experienced during the December quarter. They were driven by industry-wide silicon shortages. And specifically, the issue that I talked about on previous calls with the legacy nodes. But looking ahead, we see two causes of supply constraints. One is the COVID-related disruptions; and there's the industry-wide silicon shortages that will continue. We've estimated the constraints to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. And if you \u2013 these constraints are primarily centered around the Shanghai corridor. And the \u2013 on a positive front, almost all of the affected final assembly factories have now restarted. And so the range \u2013 the $4 billion to $8 billion range reflects various ramps of getting back up and running. We're also encouraged that the COVID case count that's been reported in Shanghai has decreased over the last few days. And so there's \u2013 there's some reason for optimism there.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Pretty amazing how the team has navigated all the cross currents. Congrats again on the quarter.\nTim Cook: Thanks so much. \nTejas Gala: Thank you, Katy. Can we have a next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I have two as well. First of all I was hoping you just touched a little bit on the geographic growth vectors that you saw. And I think Americas grew really well 19%, 20%. But Europe and China had much more muted growth if you may. I know your compares are fairly difficult but I'm curious if anything you would call out in terms of spillover effect on the macro side from Russia, Ukraine in Europe that's seeing some impact to consumer spend or even in China. Just help us understand what happened geographically there. \nLuca Maestri: So Amit, as you said in the Americas, we had a very strong quarter up 19% very happy across the board there. Europe, again was a really good quarter for us. We grew 5% in spite of the fact that of course as you know during the month of March, we paused our sales in Russia. So we had an impact to our sales results there for a month of the quarter. But a number of European countries particularly in Western Europe did really-really well for us. And so it was a very good quarter for us pretty much in line with our expectations. Americas was better than our expectations. China was again a March quarter record for us. Keep in mind and this affected every geographic segment for us the different launch timing for the iPhone this year versus a year ago had an impact on the March quarter results because we launched the product later a year ago than we did this year. So some of the channel fill for the new products happened during the March quarter a year ago. Japan and Asia Pacific were affected by foreign exchange. Japan would have grown in line with company average in constant currency terms. Asia Pacific as well was affected by foreign exchange with the dollar appreciating against most currencies. And then again this difference in the launch timing for the iPhone made a difference. Keep in mind again the supply constraints that we had during the quarter our results would have been obviously better without the supply constraints. Overall we felt very good about the performance around the world. \nAmit Daryanani: If I could just follow up on the supply chain the $4 billion to $8 billion impact that you folks talked about. Do you think this is demand that's deferred out, or demand that's essentially destroyed because you have a product cycle that's going to come out in the year at some point soon this year? How do you think about demand deferred versus demand destroyed on that front? And then is there a sense of which product categories are most impacted by this versus not? \nTim Cook: It will affect most of the product categories. And in terms of whether it's -- whether we can recapture or not we believe that there's a percentage of it that is recapturable and a percentage of it that is likely not where somebody needs something quickly. And that ratio or that percentage is very difficult to estimate. We obviously, try to do that internally in order to demand plan but it's not something that we share. \nAmit Daryanani: Got it. Thank you.\nTejas Gala: Thanks Amit. Can we have the next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. \nChris Caso : Yes. Thank you. Good evening. Also just wanted to dig in on the supply constraints a bit. And I guess one of the things you said is that the $4 billion to $8 billion range reflects some reopening of facilities during the quarter. I know obviously it's tough to predict as you go forward into the second half of launch of new products. But at that point would you expect the constraints to still be mainly on the component side? And then hopefully if things don't get worse in China then the facilities are open and the constraints are only the component constraints as you go into the second half of the year. \nTim Cook: Yes. Chris it's hard to answer a question about unannounced products. And so I'll try to not do that. But the\u2014\nChris Caso : For all products yes.\nTim Cook: The $4 billion to $8 billion is simply as I had mentioned that if you look at the Shanghai corridor -- we have some final assembly plants in this area. And almost all of them have restarted as the good news of it working with local officials. But we planned various ramps for these. And that's the range of 4% to 8% that we've estimated. Kobi is difficult to predict. For sure for sure. \nChris Caso: As a follow-up I wanted to also follow on some of your comments regarding inflation and how Apple is dealing with it. Obviously component costs have been going up in many different areas. And then specifically in the semiconductor side costs have been going up but perhaps for some different reasons because of the additional cost of going up to new process nodes that it's higher than it has been in the past. How is Apple planning to deal with that? And is it possible for you to get through that without either raising prices on your product or affecting gross margins?\nTim Cook: Well, some of what you said is in the results for the last quarter that we've announced. And obviously we've put our current thinking in the current quarter guidance that Luca listed earlier. There are component costs that are falling and ones that are rising. And so not all of them are moving in the same direction. And so we really try to manage to the net of these. And I think we're doing a reasonable job currently navigating the what is a challenging environment.\nTejas Gala: Thanks Chris. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS. \nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you guys for taking my question. I just want to dig in a little bit on the product disruption the $4 billion to $8 billion. In the past you kind of gave us a sense for how it would affect each different product lines. And should we expect it to have similar pro rata impacts? And is there an opportunity to maybe reallocate resources to limit maybe some of the impact on the iPhone line and then maybe versus the iPad line? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nTim Cook: It will affect most of the product categories. And we obviously will look to do any kind of optimization that we can do to minimize the effect on the user.\nDavid Vogt: Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up. You talked about potential COVID-related demand issues in China and taking at 150 basis points from Russia. But when you look at the other geographies is there anything that you can share with us whether it's in Western Europe or the US that you're seeing from a demand perspective that may be sort of out of the ordinary or outside of sort of the disruptions and the lack of product demand seems to be sort of where you would think it would be at this point in the cycle. Thank you.\nTim Cook: We were happy with the iPhone growth last quarter, particularly when you think about the comp that it was going against because we had very different timing on the launches in the year ago quarter where we launched in Q1. And therefore naturally Q2 is at a different place on the new product curve. And so, it was a very difficult comp. And so we were pleased with it. And as Luca said, the Americas geography did quite well last quarter. And the US, of course, is the major geography within there. And so the US was quite strong last quarter.\nDavid Vogt: Thank you.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, David. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Tim and your entire company has done a great job at navigating through all the issues in the past several years whether it be COVID, power outages, trade wars, shipping challenges and all that. When we hopefully someday get past all of these and the supply constraints in society and turmoil hopefully across the world, do you start to reconsider the way you do the supply chain albeit just-in-time ordering and outsourcing so much of your chips? Or do you actually consider like holding more buffer inventory internally, because right now letting $4 billion to $8 billion go away it'd be nice to have that to be able to sell. So do you consider holding more buffer inventory or maybe even doing your own chips by outsourcing your own chips to control them more, or how should we think about strategically when hopefully the world is in a better place from today?\nTim Cook: Well, I'm looking forward to that day as I know all of you are. Our supply chain is truly global. And so the products are made everywhere. And we do a lot in the U.S. We'll probably be doing even more here as more chips are produced here. And we continue to look at optimizing. We learn something every day and make changes. But when you back up and kind of zoom out and look to see how the supply chain has done within the environment that you eloquently talked about, I think it's been very resilient with -- the top issue we've had clearly is the silicon shortage that I think everybody is struggling with. And I think we've done a really good job of managing through the COVID piece of it. And so -- but we are learning and we're making some changes as we go, we don't have a tenure. And so, to the degree that we learn something that we should change, you can bet that we're doing that. In this business you don't want to hold a ton of inventory. And so you want to work on cycle times and so forth to do things very quickly and take strategic inventory in places where you need to buffer for interruptions and so forth. And so we're constantly thinking about where those places are. In today's world it's not really possible for us to have buffer on silicon. And so, today silicon rolls off the fab and it's into a final assembly plant very, very quickly and we try to make that as short a time as possible.\nJim Suva: And then my quick follow-up. We've been talking about supply chain issues for multiple quarters now. Are you kind of hearing from your suppliers that maybe later half of this year, or is it actually going to go into kind of 2013 for some closer equilibrium time period?\nTim Cook: Yeah. I wouldn't \u2013 you're talking about for the silicon shortage in particular I assume. I don't want to predict that, because the \u2013 that entails knowing how worldwide demand and supply are for the whole \u2013 for industries outside of even the industry we're in. And I don't proclaim to be an expert in that. That also heavily is influenced by how strong the economies are in the different markets. And so I think there are varying levels of outcomes. And what we're focused on is doing \u2013 trying to do very well regardless of how that question is answered.\nJim Suva: Thank you. And congratulations to you and your entire team. \nTim Cook: Thanks so much.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the results as well. I'll stick to two more micro level questions here. Firstly, Tim you talked about the iPhone SE three demand that you the product that you just launched. I was hoping you could compare what you're seeing in terms of momentum to previous iPhone SE cycles? Particularly I think in the past North America has been the largest region in terms of demand what are you seeing with the current product in terms of demand by geography? And I have a quick follow-up for Luca? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah. We don't get to that level of granularity because we view it to be sensitive data that our competitors would love to have. And so I'm going to punt on answering that question. I would just say that, when you zoom out and look at iPhone, as a total we could not be happier with the iPhone 13 family of products and the strength we've seen for this cycle. And really, it's those products that have powered the line and given us the overall results that we've had on iPhone, which for the first half the revenues were $120 billion and we feel very, very good about those results. \nSamik Chatterjee: And my follow-up for Luca. Luca we are seeing sort of a settling in terms of growth rate for the Services business on the tough comps that you have. We're also seeing the gross margins there settling around this sort of 72% range. And I understand there are a lot of moving pieces beneath that. But is this sort of a good range for Services longer term, or are there sort of moving pieces there that as they scale they can take \u2013 there is an opportunity for more upside?\nLuca Maestri : Well we feel really great about the momentum for our Services business. I was looking at the absolute numbers here. This run rate of almost $20 billion is essentially double what we had just four years ago. So we've done really, really well with Services. We have a lot of momentum for a variety of reasons. The first one is the fact that our installed base of active devices continues to grow very nicely. And so that is obviously a big engine for our Services business. The second thing is that the level of engagement that we see on our platform continues to grow. We have more transacting accounts, more paying accounts, more accounts with subscriptions. The absolute amount of paid subscriptions on our platform is pretty impressive 825 million. It's an increase of 165 million in the last 12 months alone. So you can tell that this is great growth. And of course, as you've seen over the last few years, we've added a lot of new services and we plan to add new services and new features that we believe that our customers would love. And so we think that's a great -- absolute great momentum. The growth rates can change a bit, especially during COVID because we've gone through some cycles of lockdowns and then reopenings and so on. And so sometimes the comps can be a bit deceiving. We are looking at it from the lens of continuing to satisfy our customers, adding to the portfolio, improving the quality of the services and that has served us very well, because in the last 12 months, we've generated $75 billion of Services revenue. And you've seen the margins are obviously accretive to company margin. So we feel good, we feel good about the Services business. I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the growth rate for the June quarter, we expect it to be less than the 17% that we've reported in March for some of the reasons that I described. Of course, foreign exchange is an issue with the dollar being strong at this point. And of course we paused, our sales in Russia. So we need to take that into account. But in general, when we look across the board, we set all-time records and quarterly records for each one of our categories.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Samik. Can we have the next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the really strong results. I have two questions too and I do apologize. The first one is on supply constraints. Luca, if I tried to read the deal based on June quarter guidance revenue is being impacted kind of implies year-over-year down revenue. And you also spoke about a $4 billion to $8 billion supply constraint which is a large amount compared to the revenue. And I understand you have the supply constraints and the China shutdowns. I'm just kind of curious, do you think the last three quarters Apple supply chain had a better buffer inventory of semis that kind of got used up and now you're kind of more tied to whatever the true supply contains of legacy semis, or is there something else going on? And then I had a follow-up. \nLuca Maestri: What has happened obviously during COVID has change over the quarters. Recently, for example during the March quarter, the constraints that we had were limited to silicon shortages. When we are giving out this range of $4 billion to $8 billion, it's not only silicon but it's the restrictions in China that we're seeing right now. So they are different. There's additional constraints at this point that we are seeing because of the COVID situation. So it's -- that is the fundamental difference there.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up with the shutdowns, especially in places like China, have you seen actually the App Stores or your Services business actually inflect positively, or is it too short a time frame to make a judgment call on that?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, I think, it's early to tell. The restrictions in China started at the very end of March. So, it's very, very early to tell. \nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thank you Luca. Thank you very much.\nTejas Gala: Thanks, Krish. Can we have the next question, please? \nOperator: We'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. \nWamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Luca, thanks for the color around the impacts to the revenue guidance. But I was wondering if you could share a if you expect to grow overall revenue in the June quarter on a year-on-year basis. And just to be clear on these impacts that you gave those are on a year-on-year basis. Can you also tell us how much FX is a headwind if any on a quarter-on-quarter basis and incremental Russia impact quarter-on-quarter basis and incremental supply chain impact also on a quarter-on-quarter basis? And I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Well, as we said, we're not guiding to a specific revenue number. And -- but just to repeat what I said during the prepared remarks, we're having supply constraints that are caused by the COVID-related disruptions and by the silicon shortages. And that is what is creating the constraints. We expect them to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. This is substantially larger than what we've had during the March quarter. Again, let me repeat the COVID-related disruptions did not affect the March quarter. So you need to keep that in mind. With respect to foreign exchange, we expect it to be nearly 300 basis points headwind. It was about 200 basis points headwind during the March quarter. For Russia, we said that the impact on a year-over-year basis is approximately 150 basis points, that reflects the three months of the quarter. We paused sales in Russia at the beginning of March. So it was a partial impact on the March quarter. So, obviously, on a sequential basis, it's an incremental factor to keep in mind. I would say on the positive side here is that the demand for both our products and services is solid. Tim has mentioned a number of times the iPhone 13 family is having a really strong year. We -- when we look at top-selling smartphones around the world, we've had pretty incredible results during the March quarter. The top six models in the United States are iPhones, the top four in Japan, the top five in Australia, five of the top six in urban China and so on and so forth. So the iPhone 13 has been truly a global success. And as you know and as you can tell even from our website, most of the iPad and Mac models are constrained today. They've been constrained for several quarters, because the demand is very good for those products. And the Services business as you know is growing double digits. So that's what gives us confidence for the June quarter and going forward.\nWamsi Mohan : Okay. Thank you, Luca. And if I could follow-up, Tim you're in a really enviable place of being pretty far from your net cash neutral objective. At the same time, you're generating a significant amount of cash flow every year. So your capital return strategy has been an extremely successful program in the past, but $90 billion is 3% of your market cap. And on the other hand there are just a lot of assets that arguably have a lot of synergies with Apple in the health care space, the fitness area like Teladoc or [indiscernible] or Netflix in the content area. Why is this not the right time for Apple to perhaps look at such assets instead of buying back stock or maybe do both?\nTim Cook: We're always looking and we continue to look. But we would only acquire something that were strategic. We acquire a lot of smaller companies today and we'll continue to do that for IP and for great talent. And -- but we don't discount doing something larger either if the opportunity presents itself. And so -- but I don't want to go through my list with you on the phone, but we're always looking.\nWamsi Mohan: Thanks.\nTejas Gala: Great. Thanks Wamsi. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\nKyle McNealy: Hi, thanks very much for the question. This one is regarding Mac. Great quarter with the results by the way, some exciting products coming out for sure. We're noticing that there's the lead times are longer for Mac's now ordered today with some available now but many not shipping until June. Just wanted to get your insight on how much of that you think is driven by the strong March results with the product launch and likely sellout conditions versus just real tightness in the supply chain? And the obvious follow-on to that is when do you expect you might catch up and get Mac lead times back within a week?\nTim Cook: Well, we're working hard. We've got lots of customers that we want to get the new Macs too. And so we're working hard on them. They are a result of the combination of the COVID disruptions and the silicon shortage that we've talked about before. And when we might remedy that, I don't -- we're not really forecasting when we can be out of the silicon shortage, so that would be a difficult answer. I think the COVID piece of it I hope is a transitory kind of issue. And so I would hope that it would get better over time.\nKyle McNealy: Great. Thanks a lot.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nTejas Gala: Great. Thanks Kyle. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\nBen Bollin: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on services. Luca, I was hoping you could share a little bit of perspective on maybe how much of the services contribution is purely consumer versus enterprise? And how you think about the longer term opportunity to monetize the enterprise community? And then Tim for you as a follow-up, I think Jim Suva had asked a question earlier about some of your strategy. I was curious how strategy might have evolved since everything has been going on, what changes you might have seen as of late with respect to freight and some of the geographic production footprint? And any evolution that has happened as of late? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: So Ben on the services side, of course, the vast majority of what we do in services is to final consumers. We do understand and appreciate the fact that the enterprise is a great opportunity for us. Very recently, for example, we launched this new subscription service here in the United States which we call Apple Business Essentials where essentially we provide support to small and medium-sized businesses in terms of 24/7 support device management for small business owners which we think small companies will value and appreciate. Obviously, we sell Apple Care to enterprises already today. But we know enterprise in general as a market is a very interesting market for us and we're putting a lot of effort and focus on it and we believe we have really good opportunities to grow. \nTim Cook: Ben, you brought up freight. Freight is a huge challenge in today both from an inflationary point of view and from an availability point of view. And so right now the focus is on moving the freight to customers any way that we can do that. Over time, we'll do that much more efficiently. And I would hope that the fundamental rates reset some both -- and I'm talking about both ocean and air. And so both of them have come under some significant inflationary pressure partly due to COVID and some other reasons as well I would guess. And in terms of geo production we are constantly making tweaks here and there. And I don't want to go into the details of those because we view it as to be sensitive kind of information, but we're constantly making moves to optimize in the current environment. \nBen Bollin: Thank you both.\nTim Cook: Thank you.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Ben.

I'd like to now turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Tejas, and good afternoon. Today, we are proud to announce Apple's biggest quarter ever. Through the busy holiday season, we set an all-time revenue record of nearly $124 billion, up 11% from last year and better than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. And we are pleased to see that our active installed base of devices is now at a new record with more than 1.8 billion devices. We set all-time records for both developed and emerging markets and saw revenue growth across all of our product categories, except for iPad, which we said would be supply constrained. As expected, in the aggregate, we experienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter. Before I discuss our results in greater detail, I want to first acknowledge the toll that COVID continues to have on communities around the world. In many places, case counts are higher and health systems more strained than at any point throughout the pandemic. On behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to extend our deep gratitude to the scientists, doctors, nurses and so many others on the front lines of combating COVID-19. This is our eighth quarter reporting results in the shadow of the pandemic. And while I can't say it gets any easier, I can say I'm incredibly proud of the way our teams have come together and continue to innovate on behalf of our customers. A few weeks ago, we marked the 15th anniversary of the day Steve revealed iPhone to the world. We knew that we had the beginnings of something fundamentally transformative, though none of us could have predicted the incredible and meaningful impact it would have on all of our lives. The creative spirit that made the first iPhone possible has thrived at Apple every day since. We never stop creating. We never stop innovating. You can see that spirit reflected throughout our products from the incredible performance and capability of our M1 chips to our powerful yet easy to use operating systems to our unrivaled iPhone camera systems to the beauty and magic of AirPods. That's why each of our major products leads the industry in customer satisfaction for their respective category. People expect Apple to solve hard problems with easy to use products. And iPhone has never been more popular. During the December quarter, we set an all-time revenue record for iPhone, thanks to the strength of our incredible iPhone 13 lineup. This is the best iPhone lineup we've ever had and the reaction from the press and our users have been off the charts. This past quarter, we also set another all-time revenue record for Mac with customers eager to get their hands on an M1-powered MacBook Air, iMac or MacBook Pro. We've been thrilled with the response from Pro users to the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips and to see how Apple silicon is blowing them away with its power, performance and efficiency.  Despite the constraints I mentioned earlier, our iPad lineup continues to be indispensable to tens of millions of people, from teachers and students to artists and creators. Customers are eager to get their hands on our ninth generation iPad, which features a beautiful display and double the storage capacity, as well as the new iPad Mini with its ultra portable design. Wearable, Home and Accessories, meanwhile, set an all-time revenue record. Customers are loving the Apple Watch Series 7, with its cutting edge health and fitness tracking features. Nearly every day, I get notes from customers who share how a heart alert led to a life saving appointment with a cardiologist. And more recently, I've been hearing from people who tell me that their Apple Watch saved their lives by calling 911, when they couldn't.  As I've said, we're still in the early innings with our health work that every day I'm encouraged by our positive impact.  We are also making great advancements in audio and are seeing strong demand from customers as a result. The HomePod Mini continues to earn praise for combining the intelligence of Siri with an immersive room filling audio experience. And our customers have responded with a lot of excitement to the magic of spatial audio on AirPods which packs the acoustics of a concert hall.  As always, the deep integration of hardware, software and services is a hallmark of everything Apple makes. It's a principle you can see at work in the introduction of SharePlay, a feature that offers a whole new way to create shared experiences by letting users watch and listen to their favorite content together on FaceTime. And we continue to invest in innovation across our services business, which set another all-time revenue record last quarter and performed even better than we had anticipated. The App Store continues to be an economic miracle for developers around the world and a safe and trusted place for consumers to discover their favorite apps. Since its launch, we have paid developers selling digital goods and services more than $260 billion, with 2021 setting a new record for their earnings. I'm also happy to report that in its first 2 years, Apple TV+ shows and movies have earned 200 award wins and more than 890 nominations. Among the powerful lineup are feature films like The Tragedy of Macbeth, CODA and Swan Song, along with many gripping new series coming up, including Severance and The Afterparty. Each one is a tremendous credit to all the storytellers in front of the cameras and behind them who touched audiences all over the world. Fitness+, meanwhile, continues to inspire customers to reach their health and fitness goals. We recently introduced Time to Run, an extension of our popular series Time to Walk, as well as new collections of workouts and meditations to help users make more intentional training choices. Despite the pandemic, our retail businesses saw its highest revenue in Apple's history, and we also earned our highest ever customer satisfaction scores. That is a testament to the incredible adaptability our teams have shown as we've reimagined [digital] experience. I also want to take a moment to thank our retail employees and AppleCare teams for the deep care you've given to our customers as they look to get the most out of our products, learn new skills or track down the perfect gift. We have always led with our values and with compassion and care and never has that been more needed than during the pandemic. Last quarter, we celebrated 10 years of our Employee Giving program, which we started to help our employees identify and support the causes they care most deeply about. We pledged to match their contributions to organizations doing important work at every level from their local food pantry to global humanitarian non-profits. In the last decade, this program has contributed nearly $725 million to charitable organizations. We also celebrated 15 years of Apple's partnership with a global fund on Project RED supporting their life-saving work to expand healthcare services in Sub-Saharan Africa for people living with HIV/AIDS. With the support of our customers, we've now raised nearly $270 million to fund prevention, testing and counseling services for people impacted by HIV/AIDS. And in keeping with our abiding belief in and commitment to education, we also launched a new partnership with the Boys & Girls Club of America. This initiative will help young people across the U.S. learn to code on iPad using our Everyone Can Code curriculum. And we are continuing to drive innovations to help combat climate change. We are already carbon neutral across our own operations, and we are working intensely to meet our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life cycle of our products. To celebrate Black History Month, we will be releasing a special edition Apple Watch Black Unity Braided Solo Loop and a matching Unity Lights Watch Face. And through our racial equity and justice initiative, we are continuing to support organizations blazing trails to a more equitable world in our economies, our classrooms and our criminal justice system. We recognize, as ever, that it takes all of us to confront our most profound challenges. And at Apple, we are determined to do our part. That includes our own work and inclusion and diversity, which we are advancing every day. Let me close by saying that despite the uncertainty of the world, there is one thing of which I am certain: Apple will continue to [innovate] every day and in every way to deliver on the promise of technology at its best. I will now turn it over to Luca to go over our quarterly results in more detail.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the December quarter. We set an all-time revenue record of $123.9 billion, an 11% increase from a year ago. We reached new all-time records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and the rest of Asia Pacific. And it was also an all-time record quarter for both products and services. On the product side, revenue was $104.4 billion, up 9% over a year ago, despite significant supply constraints. We grew in each of our product categories, except iPad, where supply constraints were particularly pronounced, and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The strong level of sales performance, the unmatched loyalty of our customers and the strength of our ecosystem have driven our current installed base of active devices to a new all-time record of 1.8 billion devices. The growth in the installed base were broad-based as we set all-time records in each major product category and in each geographic segment. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24% over a year ago, with December quarter records in every geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.8%, up 160 basis points from last quarter due to volume leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by higher cost structures. Products gross margin was 38.4%, up 410 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 72.4%, up 190 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $34.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.10 both grew more than 20% year-over-year and were all-time records. Operating cash flow of $47 billion was also an all-time record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 9% year-over-year to an all-time record of $71.6 billion despite supply constraints, thanks to a remarkable customer response to our new iPhone 13 family. We set all-time records in both developed and emerging markets, reached all-time high in the iPhone active installed base and the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. For Mac, revenue of $10.9 billion was an all-time record with growth of 25% year-over-year driven by strong demand for our newly redesigned MacBook Pro powered by M1 despite supply constraints. We are 1 year into our transition to Apple silicon and already, the vast majority of our Mac sales are from M1-powered devices, which helped drive a record number of upgraders during the December quarter. Our momentum in this category is very impressive as the last 6 quarters have been the best 6 quarters ever for Mac. iPad generated $7.2 billion in revenue, down 14% year-over-year due to very significant supply constraints, but customer demand was very strong across all models. Despite the supply shortages, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter, thanks to a high number of customers that are new to iPad. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories set a new all-time record of $14.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year. And we set all-time revenue records in each geographic segment. We also continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category to create unique experiences showcasing our deep integration of hardware, software and services. In addition to an outstanding level of sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24%, with all-time records for cloud services, for music, video, advertising and payment services and a December quarter record for the App Store. These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we are seeing on many fronts. First, as I mentioned before, our installed base has continued to grow and has reached an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the December quarter in every geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continue to show very strong growth. We now have more than 785 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up 165 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, and we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings. Just in this last quarter, we have added incredible new content on Apple TV+, on Fitness+ and Apple Arcade and a brand-new way to listen to music with Apple Music Voice. We also announced in November the beta program for Apple Business Essentials, a new service offering that brings together device management 24/7 support and iCloud storage to our small businesses, manage the end-to-end life cycle of their employees' Apple devices. We are very excited that many thousands of small business customers are already actively participating in the beta program. This announcement is just one of many ways we are expanding our support for enterprise and business customers. With the latest MacBook Pros that we've introduced last October, the new M1-powered Mac lineup has quickly become the preferred choice of Macs among enterprise customers. Shopify, for example, is upgrading its entire global workforce to M1-powered MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. By standardizing on M1 Max, Shopify continues its commitment to providing the best tools to help its employees work productively and securely from anywhere. And Deloitte Consulting is expanding the deployment of the Mac Employee Choice program, including offering the new M1 MacBook Pro to empower their professionals to choose devices that work best for them in delivering consulting services. Let me now turn to our cash position. Due to our strong operating performance and holiday quarter seasonality, we ended the quarter with $203 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $123 billion. As a result, net cash was $80 billion at the end of the quarter. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we were able to return nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $14.4 billion through open market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we're also able to return nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $14.4 billion through open market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares. We also began $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30 million shares. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a March quarter revenue record despite significant supply constraints, which we estimate to be less than what we experienced during the December quarter. We expect our revenue growth rate to decelerate from the December quarter, primarily due to 2 factors. First, during the March quarter a year ago, we grew revenue by 54%. Remember that last year, we launched our new iPhones during the December quarter. While this year, we launched them during the September quarter. Due to the later launch a year ago, some of the associated channel inventory fill occurred during the March quarter last year. As a result of the different launch timing, we will face a more challenging year-over-year compare. Second, we expect foreign exchange to be a 3-point headwind when compared to the December quarter growth rate. We currently expect FX to have a negative impact on growth of 2 points in the March quarter, while it represented a 1 point benefit during the December quarter. Specifically related to Services, we expect to grow strong double digits but decelerate from the December quarter performance. This is due to a more challenging compare because a higher level of lockdowns around the world last year led to increased usage of digital content and services. We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.5 billion and $12.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on February 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2022. And with that, let's open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Absolutely. We'll take our first question from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Hearing no response, we'll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Your margins have clearly been very impressive. So I have one question each on product and one on services gross margins. On product gross margins, that's clearly benefiting from a very strong mix. So Tim, I'm curious how sustainable do you think these mix trends are from the data that you see? And can you share any thoughts across how the Pro and Pro Max mix compared to prior cycles? And on the services side, if I could just ask that, too. When you look at the gross margins there, that's been really impressive. Can you give us some sense of where within services, you're seeing particularly favorable mix trends? And how should investors think about the trajectory of these margins given some of the sizable investments you're making to drive very successful areas like content for TV+ as an example?\nTim Cook: Wamsi, it's Tim. In terms of the mix, we don't comment directly on mix. But what I would tell you is that we saw strong demand across the iPhone 13 family. And in fact, we had several of the top-selling models in various markets, including the top 5 in the U.S. and Australia, the top 4 in Urban China, 2 of the top 3 in the UK, 3 of the top 4 in France and Germany and 4 of the top 6 in Japan. And certainly, based on some external data that I've seen, it does seem to say that we are gaining share as well. So we feel quite good about the momentum of iPhone. And I should add that we were constrained during the quarter.\nLuca Maestri: Wamsi, on the services side, you were asking about gross margin there. As you know, our services business in aggregate is accretive to overall company margin. And as you know, our services portfolio is very broad, and it contains businesses with very different margin profiles. The difference in margin profile is due in part to the nature of those businesses and in part to the way that we account for them, in some cases, we account on a net basis as opposed to a gross basis. And so as a result, the services gross margin percentage over time will be influenced by the relative growth of the different businesses within the portfolio. We do not guide at the product and services level, but I think you've seen the guidance that we provided for the March quarter at the total company level, 42.5% to 43.5%, obviously very strong compared to our recent history. And so we're very pleased with that.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\nKyle McNealy: Congrats on the solid iPhone result. That's very good. I assume that you may have prioritized iPhone to the extent there may be similar components that are used for iPhone and iPad. Can you just level set me on that if that's not the case? And if it is, should we see a recovery in iPad as you move past your prime iPhone selling season and you may have better access to components or better supply as we move through the next few months of the year?\nTim Cook: Yes. Kyle, it's Tim. From a supply constraint point of view, as you recall, we said that in Q1, the December quarter, that would have constraints more than 6, and we clearly did have constraints more than 6. On March, we're saying that where we will have -- we will do better or have less constraints than we had in the December quarter. If you look at the commonality between different products, there is some. But generally, the challenge is on legacy nodes. And these legacy nodes are by supplier. And so it's much more focused on the supplier than anything else and versus us behind the curtain finding a place to take it. There's not -- none of that, but there is some of that. But largely, we have to take it where the shortages are.\nKyle McNealy: Okay. Great. Can you give us any other color on kind of the trajectory of iPad and what's impacting this quarter and where it might go in the March and the June quarter?\nTim Cook: Yes. The issue with iPad, and it was a very significant constraint in the December quarter, was very much on these legacy nodes that I had talked about. Virtually all of the problem was in that area. And so overall, we're not guiding by product constraint -- by product level. But at the -- but overall, we do see an improvement in the March quarter in terms of the constraints going down versus what they were in the December quarter.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.\nShannon Cross: Tim, could you talk a bit about the Mac business? Looking back, it's up about 50% from the calendar 2019 revenue. You did almost $11 billion this quarter, and you're still working through the M1 transition. So can you talk about where you see the opportunity to gain share? What are really sort of the target markets that you think you can go after in order to grow this beyond think it was about $37 billion in the last 12 months? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes. Shannon, thank you for the question. Mac set an all-time revenue record at $10.9 billion for the quarter. That was up 25%. And as you point out, the last 6 quarters for the Mac have been the top 6 revenue quarters of all time. And what's further very good about this is we set all-time revenue records in Americas, in Europe and the rest of Asia Pacific. And we set a December quarter record in Greater China. And so it's not narrowed to a particular geographic area that we're doing well in. It's almost -- about almost across the board. The response is very much because of M1. And we got even more response with the MacBook Pro that we launched in the -- during the Q1 time frame. The -- both the upgraders, which we had a record number of upgraders for the December quarter, but also in markets like China, 6 out of 10 sales are people new to the Mac. And so it's powered by both upgraders and switchers. Customer satisfaction is off the charts. And so what I see this as is a -- that will -- a product that will be very successful in a number of different markets from education, to business, to the creative industry and in all geographic markets. We're not limiting ourselves.\nShannon Cross : Great. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit more on services? Just obviously outperformed your guidance or your expectations as well as certainly where we were at. Where were the -- what were the things that really outperformed? And maybe what trends are you seeing that is driving the extra revenue?\nLuca Maestri : Yes, Shannon. It was -- I mean it was really great on all fronts. We said December quarter records in every geographic segment. And then as I mentioned earlier, an all-time record for cloud, for music, for video, for advertising, for payment services. December quarter record in the App Store. So we've done, as you said, better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter. This overperformance has been spread around the world and spread around our services categories. And the reality is this combination of factors, the fact that the installed base is growing, the fact that we continue to have more and more engagement of our customers on all the services -- paid subscriptions is a phenomenal story, right? We now have 785 million paid subs. We just -- we've increased 165 million in the last 12 months alone, right? And so all these things combined are really powering the business. Very, very pleased with the performance.\nOperator: We'll hear next from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Huberty : So first question just as it relates to some of the disruption you've seen on the component side, manufacturing and logistics over the past couple of years, are you starting to rethink your broader supply chain strategy or the manufacturing footprint on the back of the significant disruption? Are you happy with the overall geographic exposure that you see in the supply chain today?\nTim Cook: Katy, if you sort of step back and look at how we've done, our largest issue by far has been the chip shortage. That is industry-wide and on these legacy nodes, as I had mentioned earlier. And I think our supply chain actually does very good considering the shortages because it's a fast-moving supply chain. The cycle times are very short. There's very little distance between a chip being fabricated and packaged and a product being -- going out of factory. And so, no, I don't see that it makes a fundamental change in the supply chain.\nKathryn Huberty : Okay. And how are you thinking about the metaverse opportunity and Apple's role in that market?\nTim Cook: Well, that's a big question. But we're a company in the business of innovation. So we're always exploring new and emerging technologies. And I -- you've spoken at length about how this area is very interesting to us. Right now, we have over 14,000 AR kit apps in the App Store, which provide incredible AR experiences for millions of people today. And so we see a lot of potential in this space and are investing accordingly.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Amit Daryani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani : I have 2 as well. I guess both up on the supply chain side, I think these continue to be fairly volatile. I'd love to get your perspective, if you feel, if things or supply chain issues are starting to alleviate or they still remain challenging? And then maybe I missed this, but could you perhaps tell us how much revenue was left on the table in December because of the supply chain issues? And how does that number shake up in March?\nTim Cook: Yes. Amit, what we've said in terms of December and March was that it's very difficult to estimate with great precision the constraints. But we said that they would be more than the Q4 or more than the September quarter, and we're saying that March will be less than the December quarter. And so that's the kind of verbiage that we\u2019ve placed around it. In terms of is it still challenging? Yes, it is challenging. And for us, we pride ourselves on getting products to customers who really want them and try to do that in a fast basis. And so it's frustrating that we can't always do that at the speed that we would like. However, March is better than December. And so there's some encouraging sign there. We're not predicting, [which we do not know] overall, obviously because of the number of variables that go into such a prediction.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. Tim, I think one of the topics investors can struggle a fair a bit with Apple is really just sort of understand visibility around your product road map, and I think some of your tech peers tend to be more vocal about their initiative. Some of them go change their name when they find an initiative that\u2019s attractive I feel. You folks are spending, I think, $23 billion on R&D in '21. So you're really spending a fair amount. And maybe without telling us the road map, could you just talk about how do you think about where to focus your R&D resources on? And to some extent, is the way to think about this R&D spend, how much of it is really done on things that are more evolutionary in products that are out in the marketplace versus things that we haven't seen yet are on potential new offerings?\nTim Cook: We have a little different model. We try to announce things when they're ready or close to ready and try to maintain an element of surprise in there. And so that explains hopefully what we do with our road map. And I think that's proven successful for us, and other people can do it differently, of course, but it's pretty been good for us over time to do that. So we're going to continue to do that. In terms of deciding where we invest in, we look at areas that are sort of at the intersection of hardware, software and services. And because we think that, that's where the magic really happens and it brings out the best in Apple. And so there are areas that have more than peaked our interest, and we are investing in those. And you can tell through time that we've ramped our R&D spend even more than we were before. And so there's quite a bit of investment going into things that are not on the market at this point as there always are.\nOperator: We'll hear next from David Vogt with UBS.\nDavid Vogt: I just wanted to dive in perspective on China and sort of the macro climate there and how that sort of pertains to your business as we think about it going forward. And the reason why I'm asking is we've heard some concerns that current policies might have caused a pause in this market and smartphone inventory. Maybe more specifically the local vendors could be a little bit elevated going into Chinese New Year. So we just want to get your thoughts on what you're seeing in this market around, the sort of potential development and then maybe touch on sell-in versus sell-through in that market. And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Well, I can only comment on, for us. Our sales grew 21% there in the last quarter, and we're very proud of that. I'll stay away and let other people be the economist and make the macro determinations. But what we're seeing there was super impressive with all-time revenue records and a record number of upgraders and strong double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone, which is very important to us. And as I've mentioned before, we had the top 4 selling phones in urban China. And so there's a lot of good there. And I would remind you that iPhone was constrained in the quarter. And so I'm not sure where the statements are coming around about inventory, and I can't comment on whether other people have more or not, I don't know the answer to that. Thanks for the question.\nDavid Vogt: That's helpful, Tim. And then maybe just on the supply chain. Obviously, you've been managing it incredibly well over the last 12 to 18 months. And gross margins have actually performed relatively well, mix driven both between products and services. Can you help us think about sort of the quantifiable impact or maybe the costs that you're carrying due to the supply chain that may be sort of -- I don't want to use the word transitory, but we'd expect over the longer term, that might be sort of abate a little bit and you'll get a little bit of a benefit as we get past some of these supply chain issues over the next 12 months or so?\nTim Cook: We're seeing inflation, and it's factored into our gross margin and OpEx that Luca reviewed with you earlier. Logistics, as I've mentioned on a previous call, is very elevated in terms of the cost of moving things around. I would hope that at least a portion of that is transitory, but the world is -- the world has changed, and so we'll see.\nOperator: We'll take the question from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: I had a couple. The first question that I had was really on Apple TV+, and I know some of the other players in this market have talked about slowing subscriber growth as we exit the pandemic. So curious if you can share what trends you're seeing in Apple TV and Apple TV+ and how similar or dissimilar they are and how your content is maybe helping you on that aspect? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: We don't give out subscriber numbers for Apple TV+. What we do, do is give out a subscriber number for our subscription number for the total number of subscriptions that we had. And I think Luca mentioned earlier we ended the quarter at 785 million. And so we were incredibly pleased with that. That's a huge growth on a year-over-year basis of 165 million. And it counts, as you recall, both Apple branded and third party. In terms of how we're doing with TV+, we've been honored with 200 wins and 890 nominations. We're doing exactly like we had wanted to. We\u2019re giving storytellers a place to tell original stories and feel really good about where we are competitively and strategic position of the product.\nSamik Chatterjee: And if I can just follow up, and similarly on Apple Pay, can you just help us think about when you think about the next few years, where are the biggest opportunities, either be it in terms of like geographies or either segments -- customer segments that you may not be tapping into currently and have an opportunity in.\nTim Cook: Well, putting aside any kind of thing that sits on our road map for a second in that area, which we obviously wouldn't talk about in the call, I would say that I think Apple Card has a great runway ahead of us. It was rated to the #1 midsized credit carding customer set by J.D. Power and is getting -- has fast become people's main credit card for many, many people. And the growth of Apple Pay has just been stunning. It's been absolutely stunning. And there's still obviously a lot more there to go and because there's still a lot of cash in the environment. And so I think that both of these and whatever else we might do have a great future ahead.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James.\nChristopher Caso: Yes. So the first question is just a little bit of help in interpreting the guidance. And if you could speak to the March quarter, perhaps in terms of seasonality and seasonal performance. And Luca, as you mentioned last year, because of the later launch of the phone that some of that came into the March quarter, and that was better than seasonal performance in March. Should we interpret because the supply constraints are easing somewhat as you go into the March quarter that we should see something similar that March quarter would get some better than seasonal performance? Is that the correct way to interpret your guidance?\nLuca Maestri : Well, and we talked about it on a year-over-year basis because that's probably how most people look at it. And so just to recap what we said. First of all, we expect a record for the March quarter. We expect solid growth on a year-over-year basis. And -- but as Tim was saying, we still expect significant supply constraints but less than what we've seen in December. So I think on that basis, you can do the math around sequential. But given where we are in the environment, given the difficult compare both on iPhone, and as I mentioned on -- during my prepared remarks, on services, we're very, very happy with the way we're guiding and the way the business is going right now.\nChristopher Caso : Okay. As a follow-up, a follow-up question is on perhaps the sustainability and repeatability of the growth in iPhone after 2 very good years, well-received product and the 5G upgrade cycle. And I think there was a point in time when perhaps there's a view from some that iPhone was ex growth, and that's been proven wrong. Off of these very strong results, maybe you can speak to your level of confidence that iPhone continues to grow in the future? And kind of what are the avenues for that growth?\nTim Cook: Yes. Chris, it's Tim. What I would say is that iPhone has become an integral part of so many people's lives now more than ever. And the active installed base of iPhone continues to grow and is now at an all-time high. And during December, as we had mentioned, we had a record number of upgraders and grew switchers strong double-digit, which I think speaks to the strength of the product. And that's all baked into some -- an enormous customer satisfaction rating of 98% and doing well throughout the geographies. And I've mentioned some of the geos that we track and how many units that we have on the top-selling model charts. And so -- and even though this is the second product announcement that has 5G in it, we're still really in the early innings of 5G, meaning if you look at the installed base and look at how many people are on 5G versus not, and we don't release those exact numbers, but you can do some math and estimate those, we maintain a very optimistic view on iPhone long term.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ben Bollin with Cleveland Research.\nBenjamin Bollin : Tim, I'm interested in how you think about the relationship between the total iOS installed base and then the subsequent performance you see within the services or the paid subscriptions. And a second part to that is, how do you look at the existing services business in terms of the growth you get from customers who are already subscribers versus completely net new or greenfield subscribers?\nTim Cook: I think I'll let Luca comment on the second part of that. But if you back up and sort of look at how we're doing, even though we have 785 million subs, relative to the total number of products offered and the customers that's offered in, there's still a lot of room to grow there. And so I -- the way that I look at it is that we -- there's a lot more greenfield in front of us.\nLuca Maestri : And Ben, on the services engagement and how we think about customers, right, obviously, it's important for us that customers are engaged on our services platforms. And the ones that we have, we know that the more engaged they are, they're more likely to stay with Apple for the long term. So we just obviously track all those metrics, and they're very important for us. And that's why we continue to improve the quality of our offerings and the quantity over time. As you've seen, we launched a lot of new services. We obviously care a lot about new customers as well, and that's why we keep track of the installed base and a lot of other metrics on that front. It's very similar to what we do with products. I mean, also for products, we care a lot about upgraders. We care a lot about switchers. It's obviously the combination of the 2 that when you put it together provides the level of growth that you've actually seen in our Services business. I mean the last 12 months, we've done over $72 billion of revenue on Services. It's the size of a Fortune 50 company. It couldn't happen with our contribution from both existing and new customers.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar : First of all, congratulations on stellar quarter in December and all the records that the Apple community has set. Tim, I had a question on the content on Apple TV. When we look at the Apple content that you guys put all on TV original content, it's typically very socially responsible and healthy, for example, Ted Lasso. Has this, in effect, created a constraint or a hesitancy of some sort for Apple to go and purchase studios when they come up? Or have those decisions be primarily financial or otherwise?\nTim Cook: We don't make purely financial decisions about the content. We try to find great content that has a reason for being. And we love shows like Ted Lasso and several of the other shows as well that have reason for existing and may have a good message and may make people feel better at the end of it. But we're -- but I don't view that we've narrowed our universe, the things we're selecting from. There's plenty to pick from out there. And I think that we're doing a pretty good job of it as we speak.\nHarsh Kumar : Fair enough. And then my follow-up was the Apple vision of healthcare in the future. So you guys have sort of cautiously approached healthcare with iWatch and iPhone. It's mostly a preventative sort of approach. It provides you updates. But do you see a situation down the line where Apple perhaps plays a more active role, either through the Watch or some of the device where perhaps a doctor or a hospital mandates that the watch we want for effectively for critical and vital monitoring? And I was curious if you could just give us some color on how you guys think about health care and iWatch and that confluence?\nTim Cook: Well, the -- with the Apple Watch, there's literally not days that go by without me getting notes about someone that's received a health alert. Maybe it's to do with their cardiovascular health. Or more recently, a lot of people have told me that they fell and was knocked unconscious and couldn't respond and the watch responded for them to emergency contacts and emergency personnel. And so there's a lot that we're doing today. My sense has always been that there's more here. I don't want to get into a road map discussion in the call. But we continue to kind of pull the string and see where it takes us. But we're really satisfied with how we're doing in this area because we are fundamentally changing people's lives and, in some cases, saving people's lives. So it's an area of great interest.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple Podcast as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $89.5 billion for the September quarter. We achieved an all-time revenue record in India, as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle-East, South Asia and an all-time record in India. In services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continue to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us. We've continued to invest in the future and manage for the long-term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control, while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending. And we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has gotten such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year. Now let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup. The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras and the intuitive Dynamic Island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone15 Pro lineup has a beautiful strong and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5X Telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family and reviews have been off the charts. In Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions, as well as difficult compares against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips, M3; M3 Pro; and M3 Max. We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace. And our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our Pro users, while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. And according to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to iPad. Revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life, while giving students a window into the world around them. And in artist workshops, design studios and everywhere else, creative minds come together, iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas farther than they ever could before. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination. Apple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software, and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new face time features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more, faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving. Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and video, as well as the September quarter revenue record in Apple Music. Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school, or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day. Apple TV+ continues to delight customers as well, with new and returning shows like the Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry and Monarch. We're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+ and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch, just over four years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins. We also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home MLS cup. And nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China and the UK and expanded the Apple store online to Vietnam and Chile. And we have another store opening in China this week. In September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day and the energy and excitement were unbelievable. Every time we connect with the customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From simple joys of creating and sharing memories, to lifesaving features like emergency SoS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. And whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone, or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values. Our environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise, the best products in the world should be the best products for the world. We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation, because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped, unless everyone steps up and does their part. Our first ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using a 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third impact accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy. Apple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense a possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determined to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points. And on a constant-currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total, and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and Services grew double digits. Products revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year, due to very challenging compares on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on. At the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets. Our total installed-base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. Our performance in Services were broad based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category. Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion, diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India as September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia . Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switches. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips. Our installed base is at an all-time high and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. Also, we saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base with over half of the customers who purchase iPads during the quarter being new to the product and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year. We had a September quarter record in Europe and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product and customer satisfaction for the Watch was recently measured at 97% in the U.S. Services had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. And we're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our Services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Also our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love this new offering. Turning to enterprise. We are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction. Starbucks continuously invest in Apple technology to bring the best experience to the customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity. And in Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice, so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter. And our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares. Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment. Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. And we continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter, total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week. We expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax-rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hey. Good afternoon, and thank you very much for the questions. I just have a question on iPhone storage and demand versus iCloud. As demand for storage grows, are you seeing a mix-shift towards higher storage iPhone models or are consumers mostly opting for the same because of increased uptake of iCloud+? What are some of the strategic and financial considerations here and trade-offs, as you think about the mix shift towards higher storage models versus iCloud penetration? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Michael, it's Tim. As you probably know, we started the line with the iPhone Pro Max at 256, and so we are seeing a different mix, if you will, this year than last year. Outside of that, not significant changes.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you. And as a separate follow-up, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the market conditions on notebooks and desktops, and then any color that you can share regarding the timing of the Mac -- M3 MacBook Pros this year versus the M2 earlier in the calendar year? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah. We're thrilled to have announced the M3 lineup and get the new MacBook Pro, the new iMac out there. We couldn't be more excited about it. We -- as Luca said, with the lineup that we've got and the compare issue that we don't have during Q1, we anticipate a significant acceleration in the Mac space for Q1. To just repeat a little bit about the circumstances of the performance last quarter, in the year-ago June quarter, we had a factory disruption that lasted several weeks. The pent-up demand that resulted from that was filled in the September quarter, and that made the September quarter not only a record, but a substantial record. And obviously, we're now comparing against that for '23 and so that, I wouldn't look at the negative 34% as representative of the underlying business performance. It's sort of the net of it.\nMichael Ng: Excellent. That's very clear. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the execution in the quarter. I'm curious, if you could help us characterize what the demand environment you're seeing in China looks like. How has the reception been to the iPhone 15? And kind of similar question to the prior one, how would you characterize the mix within China as you go through this current product cycle? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yeah. If you look at how we did in Greater China for the quarter, we came in at, on a revenue basis, minus 2. But one thing to keep in mind here is that the FX impact was nearly 6 points. So we grew in constant currency. And underneath that, if you look at the different -- the categories, iPhone actually set a September quarter record in mainland China. And the -- what pulled down the performance was a combination, largely of Mac and iPad. Services also grew during the quarter and the Mac and iPad suffered from the same issues that the company did with the compare issues to factory disruptions in Q3 that were filled subsequently in Q4 of '22. We had the -- in addition to that, we had the top four selling phones in urban China for last year, and I was -- I just took a trip over there and could not be more excited about the interactions I had with the customers and employees and others.\nAaron Rakers: Yeah. And then, as a quick follow-up, I'm curious as we move towards more of an inflationary component pricing environment. Luca, how do we think about that effect? How you're thinking about the gross margin at the product level, as maybe component pricing starts to turn, what's been clearly very favorable over the last several quarters to more of an inflationary environment? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Well, as you've seen from our results in Q4 and the guidance for Q1, we're obviously experiencing very strong levels of gross margin. The 45.2% was a record for the September quarter. And then, the guidance for Q1 is obviously strong at 45% to 46%. Our gross margins are affected by multiple factors. Obviously, the commodity environment is one of them, as you mentioned. It's been a good environment in recent quarters. But equally important is the mix of what we sell. And obviously, growth in Services for us is favorable, and that has helped our company gross margin. Foreign exchange, on the other hand, has been a drag for us for several quarters, given the strength of the dollar. We don't provide guidance past the December quarter, which is a very important one for us because it's the beginning of the product cycle for many products. And so we feel very good, very confident about, this coming year, and I think the gross margin guidance reflects that.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Aaron. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Awesome. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Maybe if I start, Luca, I know that the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are constrained today, but I think some of your comments suggests you should be back to supply demand balance before quarter end. So, I guess, my question is, does your December quarter revenue guidance account for any supply constraints? And if so, is there any way to kind of quantify how much supply would be limiting your December quarter revenue performance? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. It's correct. We are constrained today on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. We're working very hard to get the product in the hands of all the customers that have ordered it. We expect, as of today, that we're going to be in supply demand balance by the end of the quarter. So the guidance reflects that.\nErik Woodring: Okay, very clear. Thanks. And then, maybe for you and Tim. You guys have been on the leading end of -- edge of innovation across hardware, software, silicon, services. And I'm sure there's plenty of technology in kind of longer-term projects that you're investing in. How should we think about your capital intensity as we look to fiscal year '24, just given over the last few years, CapEx as a percentage of revenue had been relatively low compared to the eight years prior? So should we expect a step-up or kind of similar capital intensity? And what are the more notable moving pieces, if any, that we should be thinking about? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Well, the big areas of investment for us are tooling and equipment for manufacturing plants. Our investments in data centers and our investments in our own facilities, both corporate facilities and retail stores. And so, both for the tooling in our plants and our data center investments, we tend to have a bit of a hybrid model where we share some of the investments with our partners and suppliers and so maybe that's why you see sometimes a bit of variability. But over the last few years, we've made all the investments that we needed to make. And obviously, we're planning to make all the investments that we believe are needed and appropriate in order to continue to innovate.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for the color, guys.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Eric. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys for taking my question. I know you covered China. I want to pivot to the US for a second. Obviously, iPhone and the business looks like it returned to growth in the quarter. But it's still relatively softer kind of where I thought it would be at this point in the cycle and some of the U.S. carriers obviously haven't been that particularly aggressive in promoting upgrades. So just wanted to kind of get a sense, first, what you're seeing from your partners in the U.S. kind of currently and going forward and what do you expect? And then, second, Luca, on the margins, I mean, is it fair to say that the mix in Q1 from a product versus services dynamic is kind of the key driver of the better gross margin guide as a whole relative to, let's say, the December quarter? Or is there anything else? I know you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces, but is that the primary driver of the uplift in the margin? Thanks.\nTim Cook: On the U.S. carriers and the U.S. business in general, it's really too early to call the iPhone cycle, particularly with the constraint around the Pro and the Pro Max and the U.S. tends to do quite well with those products. It's really too early to tell what the upgrade rates will be and what the switcher rates will be.\nLuca Maestri: On the margin side, if I understood your question correctly about the December quarter guidance, keep in mind that actually December is the quarter where our products business is tends to be very heavy because of the holiday season. And so the services gross margins that are accretive to total company had an impact, but not as meaningful as other quarters during the year and so I think that the main drivers of the guidance that we provided are the fact that we are seeing improved costs, and improved mix on our -- on the product side of the business, partially offset by foreign exchange, which continues to be a drag, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. So the weakness in iPad and Wearables are less of an impact on sort of the margin trajectory in the December quarter?\nLuca Maestri: That's correct.\nDavid Vogt: I guess?\nLuca Maestri: That's correct.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. Thanks, Luca.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, David. We'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first off, just the Services growth rate, there's a tremendous acceleration I think in September quarter, the 16% growth. And it sounds like it\u2019s going to hold there pretty well into December. Can you just talk about what is driving this acceleration? Are there a couple of products that have just stepped up in a very meaningful way? Just maybe flush out like what is driving this acceleration because it's fairly notable compared to what you've been seeing in the last few quarters.\nLuca Maestri: We had a really strong quarter across the border, Amit, because both geographically and from a product category standpoint, we saw very significant growth, I mentioned the records on a geographic basis. And from a category standpoint, literally, we set records in each one of the big categories. We had all-time record for App Store, for advertising, for cloud, video, AppleCare, payments and a September quarter record for Music. So it's hard to pick, one in particular because they all did well. And really then, we step back and we think about why is it that our Services business is doing well and it's because we have an installed base of customers that continues to grow at a very nice space and the engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. We have more transacting accounts, we have more paid accounts, we have more subscriptions on the platform and we continue to add. We continue to add content and features. We're adding a lot of content on TV+, new games on Apple Arcade, new features, new storage plans for iCloud. So it's a combination of all these things and the fact that the engagement in the ecosystem is improving, and therefore, it benefits every service category.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And then, maybe if I could ask you about Vision Pro, which I believe is supposed to be launched more broadly sometime in 2024, in the early part of the year. I'm curious how different do you think the launch and the consumer education of this product or a new category will be versus other things like AirPods or Apple Watch that you've done. And then, perhaps any themes I think that's set out to you from the developers that have been able to use this and the developer labs, what feedback have you gotten from them?\nTim Cook: Yeah. That's a great question. There is a tremendous amount of excitement around the Vision Pro and we're -- we've been very happy to share it with developers, and we have developer labs set up in different parts of the world so that they can actually get their hands on it and are working on apps and I've been fortunate enough to see a number of those. And there is some real blow away kinds of things that are coming out, and so that all looks good. To answer your question about is it similar to AirPods or Apple Watch, I would say, no. There's never been a product like the Vision Pro. And so, we're purposely bringing it out in our stores only, so we can really put a great deal of attention on the last mile of it. We'll be offering demos in the stores and it will be very different process than the -- a normal grab-and-go kind of process.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, thanks for the question and congratulations on tremendous execution in a very tough macro. Actually, Tim, the last question is a perfect segue here, given what you are doing with your Vision Pro. So lots of companies are experimenting with generative AI. I'm curious about what kind of efforts you have. I'm sure there are segues into Pro Vision that you have, but I was curious about if you can give us a glimpse on how you might be able to monetize some of these efforts of generative AI.\nTim Cook: If you kind of zoom out and look at what we've done on AI and machine learning and how we've used it, we view AI and machine learning as fundamental technologies, and they're integral to virtually every product that we ship. And so just recently, when we shipped iOS 17, it had features like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. AI is at the heart of these features. And then, you can go all the way to then lifesaving features on the launch end of phone like fall detection, crash detection, ECG on the watch. These would not be possible without AI. And so, we don't label them as such, if you will. We label them as to what their consumer benefit is. But at the fundamental technology behind it is AI and machine learning. In terms of generative AI, we have -- obviously, we have work going on. I'm not going to get into details about what it is, because -- as you know, we don't -- we really don't do that. But you can bet that we're investing, we're investing quite a bit, we're going to do it responsibly and it will -- you will see product advancements over time that where the -- those technologies are at the heart of them.\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Tim. Very clear. And for my follow-up, I had a philosophical question. So, you guys always try to provide the best experience for consumers. To that end, I think, over the last decade you in-sourced a lot of important chips in your phones, in your Macs, iPads, so on and so forth. And that was, I think, a function that ARM wasn't around in the industry from a merchant angle. But now, we see these the silicon guys, the chip guys moving to ARM architecture. So my question to you is, has the move to internal silicon been economically profitable proposition for Apple? Or is it -- or is it a strategic one, where you simply need to own this and it's vital to your products for the consumer experience or maybe there's a path back to chip vendors at some point in time?\nTim Cook: It's really enabled us to build products that we could not build without doing it ourselves. And as you know, we like to own the primary technologies in the products that we ship and arguably, the silicon is at the heart of the primary technologies, and so, no, I don't see going back. I am happier today than I was yesterday, than I was last week that we made the transition that we've made, and I see that benefit every day of it.\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Harsh. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, over the last decade, pretty much you've gained a lot of share in China. As you look, your -- some of the domestic players are starting to re-emerge, especially in the high-end phone space. I know you touched on China. But how would you see Apple's positioning and opportunity for continued share gains, particularly in China? And how was the linearity in China from a demand perspective? And I have a follow-up, please.\nTim Cook: In the September quarter, we set an iPhone record -- revenue record in China and we're very proud of that and we obviously grew. The market predictions that I've seen, we've had the market contracting. And so if that's -- if those are correct, then we gained share last quarter. And so we are very proud of that, I don't know what every quarter will hold. And obviously, we just give a bit of color on the current quarter. But over the long term, I view China as an incredibly important market and I'm very optimistic about it.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim. And as a follow-up, you obviously had a great Services quarter and part of your Services business has these licensing relationships with research partners, where you serve a very important distribution function for them. Can you talk about how you think about these relationships and potentially some of the options maybe Apple has to mitigate some of the risks, given some of the scrutiny on with some of the research partners? Thank you so much.\nLuca Maestri: They are important relationships. And as you know, we don't get into our commercial relationships in the call. I see them as important and we make decisions that are in the best interest of our users or what we feel is in the best interest of our users. And that's kind of what we've done in the past and how we've -- how we'll run the show in the future as well.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had two of them too. First one, Luca, thanks for the color on gross margin. And when I look at it over the last four quarters, even if on a year-over-year basis revenue declined, the gross margins have improved. And I understand Services definitely helped. I'm just kind of curious, when you look at on a go forward basis, are most of the big step functions and cost reductions like the Mac Silicon conversion, et cetera, that are done or is there more room for margin expansion from here? And then, I had a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Well, on the product side, as you know, we -- when we launch new products, the cost structures of those products tend to be higher than the products that they replace. It happens because we are always adding new technologies, new features, and then, we worked through the cost curve over the lifecycle of the product and we tend to get benefits as time goes by. The guidance that we provided for December reflects all that and so we're starting from a better position than a year ago or than, in the past, in general. There are other factors that play a role. For example, the mix of products that we sell. Not every product has the same gross margin profile, and so our guidance, our results are reflective of that. And also, within a specific product category, a lot depends on the kind of models that we sell because they have different margin profiles. I think one of the things that we've done well over the last few years is to offer more affordability solutions to our customers in the form of instalment plans, trading options, and spend -- low-cost financing in general. And what that has accomplished is reduced the affordability threshold for our customers and therefore, they can, buy at the top of our product ranges. That has been a big factor in the reason for our margin expansion. We don't provide guidance or color past the current quarter because there's so many different variables that affect gross margins, but we obviously feel very good about the trajectory that we've had in 2023 and now, the guidance that we provide for the beginning of our fiscal '24. And we need some of these things because, obviously, their foreign exchange environment has been difficult and has been a bit of a drag for us. But net-net, we're very pleased where we are.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks for that, Luca. And then, I have a follow-up for Tim. Obviously, you're seeing amazing momentum in India. I'm just kind of curious how do you look at -- when you look at the India growth opportunity on these hardware units, how to think about ASP relative to that versus like the rest of the geographies? And is there a way to compare or contrast India, growth momentum versus China maybe a decade ago or so at the same point in the rollout of, the share gains in that geography?\nTim Cook: Yeah. It's a great question. We had an all-time revenue record in India. We grew very strong double-digits. It's an incredibly exciting market for us and a major focus of ours. We have low share in a large market, and so it would seem there's a lot of headroom there. The ASPs, I haven't looked at them most recently, but I'm sure that they're lower than the worldwide. But that doesn't bother us at all. It just -- and in terms of the similarity, I would say, each country has its own journey. And I wouldn't want to play the comparison game. But we see an extraordinary market, a lot of people moving into the middle class, distribution is getting better, lots of positives. We put two retail stores there, as you know. They're doing better than we anticipated. It's still early going, but they're off to a good start and I couldn't be happier with how things are going at the moment.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. We'll now take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the question. Tim, I appreciate all your commentary around China. It was great to kind of hear about the growth potential there, your optimism. I wanted to also ask about the supply chain and where is your priority? Do you have a priority to diversify your supply chain? How do you feel about Apple's supply chain around the world? And in particular, what do you think about further investments in the U.S. as well?\nTim Cook: Our supply chain is truly global, and so we're investing all over the world, including in the United States, we were very focused on advanced manufacturing for the U.S. and have worked on a number of different projects in the U.S., whether that's our venture with Corning on the glass or Face ID module or semiconductors. And so all of these are our advanced manufacturing and I think exactly the kinds of things that the U.S. would be and are very, very good at. We also invested in other regions of the world and we're continually optimizing the chain. And so we -- the moment we learned something that didn't work exactly right, we are tweaking it. And so we're going to continue to do that. But at the end of day, it will still be a global supply chain.\nBen Reitzes: Got it. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nBen Reitzes: Next one for Luca. Just really quick on the extra week dynamic. There was also last year an issue with the iPhone production, where there was the COVID lockdowns in China. Is it possible to give some color around what that -- I guess, having a normalized supply chain somewhat this year, what that benefit is this year and maybe contrast that with the 7 point hit from the extra week? Thanks a lot.\nLuca Maestri: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ben. I mentioned during the prepared remarks the extra week is 7 points of revenue. We did have disruptions, supply disruptions last year on the phone, on the 14 Pro and Pro Max in the December quarter a year ago. And when we normalize for those two factors, and I said it during the call, we still expect to grow on iPhone. So you take into account the, the loss of the extra week, you compare it with the supply disruptions that are not going to repeat, hopefully, this year. And when you normalize for those two things, we still expect to grow on iPhone.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot everybody. Appreciate it, Luca.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. And we'll take the last question now.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thank you very much. Tim, first off, if we look over the past two years, Apple sales are about $18 billion higher and R&D is up by about 8% -- $8 billion or over a third higher. Can you give us a sense of some of the main components or drivers behind that increase in innovation spend? Is it Apple Silicon, is it new products like Vision Pro or is it content to support new services? I think that's one of the top questions investors have. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Sure. It's a number of things, Richard. It's the -- some things I can't talk about, its Vision Pro, it's AI and ML, it's the silicon investment that we're making, the transition with the Mac and other silicon. It's sort of all of those things and -- but I think you would find that the R&D expenditure in the aggregate looks very competitive versus others.\nLuca Maestri: And I would add, Richard, on this front. Some of the investments that we're making in R&D are also one of the drivers for the gross margin expansion. So I think it's important to think about it that way.\nRichard Kramer: That's great. And Luca, you mentioned -- or Tim mentioned college students choosing Mac. Then, you mentioned the record Services revenue. What other metrics do you think you could provide to help investors understand how Apple measures and increases customer lifetime value, especially when we see a lot of users entering the ecosystem with a relatively lower-priced products or even refurbished devices? So you're growing your ecosystem, but how do you think about growing customer lifetime value over the long run?\nLuca Maestri: Well, some of the metrics that I mentioned before, obviously, we look at the installed base of active devices. We see, we want to make sure that, the customers that we acquire remain with us and so we have good visibility over that, and we pay a lot of attention to the behavior of the installed base, both by product and by geography. And then, we look at the daily engagement in the ecosystem. So that's why we pay a lot of attention on things like transacting accounts, paid accounts, we want to see if, in fact, we are able to move our customers from a free model to a paid model over time. That's obviously very, very important for us. And so, on this, we keep track of all these things and that's -- and then what we do, because I think it's really important is that over time, we add new services and that, obviously, like, for example, the progress that we've made in payments in recent years, very, very important because we've attracted more and more people that are actually now using additional features on our devices and we are able to monetize that, right. So we take all that into account, we understand what happens when a customer joins us, when they buy a primary device versus a used device, we understand their behavior, in different markets and so on. So we have, I think, pretty good visibility. And I think the progress that we're making in Services, we did $85 billion in the last 12 months. It's -- that's a size of a Fortune 50 and significantly bigger than it was just a couple of years ago.\nRichard Kramer: Absolutely. Thanks very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Saori. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $81.8 billion for the June quarter, better than our expectations. We continued to see strong results in emerging markets, driven by robust sales of iPhone with June quarter total revenue records in India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE. We set June quarter records in a number of other countries as well, including France, the Netherlands and Austria. And we set an all-time revenue record in Services driven by more than $1 billion paid subscriptions. We continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including nearly 4 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to the prior year's quarter in aggregate and in the majority of markets we track. We continue to manage deliberately and innovate relentlessly, and we are driven by the sense of possibility those efforts inspire. To that end, before I turn to the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented innovations we were proud to announce at our Worldwide Developers Conference. In addition to extraordinary new Macs and incredible updates to our software platforms, we had the chance to introduce the world to spatial computing. We were so pleased to share the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro with the world, a bold new product unlike anything else created before. Apple Vision Pro is a marvel of engineering, built on decades of innovation only possible at Apple. It is the most advanced personal electronic device ever created, and we've been thrilled by the reaction from press, analysts, developers and content creators who've had the chance to try it. We can't wait to get it into customers' hands early next year. Now let me share more with you on our June quarter results beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $39.7 billion for the quarter, down 2% from the year ago quarter's record performance. On a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue grew, and we had a June quarter record for switchers, reflecting the popularity of the iPhone lineup. iPhone 14 customers continue to praise the exceptional battery life and essential health and safety features, while iPhone 14 Plus users are loving the new larger screen size. And with Dynamic Island, Always-On display and the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone, the iPhone 14 Pro lineup is our best ever. Turning to Mac. We recorded $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We are proud to have completed the transition of our entire Mac lineup to run exclusively on Apple silicon. We are also excited to have introduced the new 15-inch MacBook Air during the quarter, the world's best 15-inch laptop and one of the best Macs we've ever made. And we launched 2 new powerhouses in computing, Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra, which are the most powerful Macs we've ever made. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion for the June quarter, down 20% year-over-year, in part due to a difficult compare because of the timing of the iPad Air launch last year. Customers are loving iPad's versatility and exceptional value. There was a great deal of excitement from creatives when we brought Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro to iPad this spring. And with the back-to-school season in full swing, iPad has the power to help students tackle the toughest assignments. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Packed with features to empower users to live a healthier life, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Ultra continue to help people take the next step on their wellness journey. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we held our biggest and most exciting WWDC yet. We were thrilled to welcome developers from across the globe to Apple Park, both in person and virtually, and to share some stunning new announcements with the world. In addition to Apple Vision Pro and the new Macs that we introduced, we had the chance to reveal some truly remarkable new innovations to our software platforms. From exciting new features like Live Voicemail and StandBy in iOS 17, to new tools for users to work, play and personalize their experience in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, to a fresh design and new workout capabilities in watchOS 10, there's so much coming later this year to empower users to get more out of their devices, and we think they're going to instantly love these new features. It was also an exciting quarter for Services where revenue reached $21.2 billion and saw a sequential acceleration to an 8% year-over-year increase, better than we expected. We set an all-time revenue record for total services and in a number of categories, including video, AppleCare, cloud and payment services. Since we introduced Apple Pay almost a decade ago, customers have been loving how easy it is to make purchases online, in apps and in stores. We're also pleased to see Apple Card build on the success of Apple Pay. Designed with our users' financial health in mind, Apple Card has become one of the most successful credit card programs in the U.S. with award-winning customer satisfaction. And this spring, we introduced a new high-yield savings account for Apple Card customers, which has become incredibly popular, with customers already making more than $10 billion in deposits. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ continues to provide a spectacular showcase of imaginative storytelling. Recently, fans welcomed new series like Hijack and Silo as well as returning fan favorites like Foundation and The Afterparty. In the few years since its launch, Apple TV+ has earned more than 1,500 nominations and 370 wins. That includes the 54 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles that Apple TV+ received last month. It's also been an exciting time for sports on Apple TV+. Soccer legend Lionel Messi made his debut with Major League Soccer last month, and fans all over the world tuned in with MLS Season Pass. We are excited about our MLS partnership, and we're thrilled to see Messi suiting up with Inter Miami. And just in time for summer concert season, Apple Music launched new discovery features celebrating live music, including venue guides in Apple Maps and set lists from tours of major artists. These new features and others join a lineup of updates coming later this year to make Services more powerful, more useful and more fun than ever. Everything we do is in service of our customers, and retail is where we bring the best of Apple. During the quarter, we opened the Apple Store online in Vietnam, and we're excited to connect with more customers there. We also redesigned our first-ever Apple Store located in Tysons Corner, Northern Virginia, with inclusive, innovative and sustainable design enhancements. We opened a beautiful new store beneath our new London headquarters in the historic Battersea Power Station. And the performance of the stores we opened in India this spring exceeded our initial expectations. With every product we create, every feature we develop and every interaction we share with our customers, we lead with the values we stand for. We believe in creating technology that serves all of humanity, which is why accessibility has always been a core value that we embed in everything we do. On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we unveiled some extraordinary new tools for cognitive, vision, hearing and mobile accessibility that will be available later this year, including Assistive Access, which distills apps to their most essential features, and Personal Voice, which allows users to create a synthesized voice that sounds just like them. Building technology and service of our customers also means protecting their privacy, which we believe is a fundamental human right. That's why we were pleased to announce major updates to Safari Private Browsing, Communication Safety and Lockdown Mode to further safeguard our users. And as part of our efforts to build a better world, we announced that we've more than doubled our initial commitment to our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to more than $200 million. We will continue to do our part to support education, economic empowerment and criminal justice reform work. And while supporting efforts to advance equity and opportunity, we continue to build a culture of belonging at Apple and a workforce that reflects the communities we serve. Through our environmental work, we're making strides in our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. Last month, Apple joined with global nonprofit Acumen in a new effort to improve livelihoods in India through clean energy innovation, and we are as committed as ever to our Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our entire supply chain and the life cycle of our products. We've long held that education is the great equalizer. With that in mind, we're expanding Apple Learning Coach, a free professional learning program that teaches educators how to get more out of Apple technology in the classroom. Today, we welcome more than 1,900 educators across the U.S. to the program. By the end of the year, we'll offer Apple Learning Coach in 12 more countries. As we're connecting with teachers, we're also celebrating the graduations of students at our app developer academies around the world. From Detroit, to Naples, to Riyadh and more, we're excited to watch these talented developers embark on careers in coding and find ways to make a positive difference in their communities. Apple remains a champion of innovation, a company fueled by boundless creativity, driven by a deep sense of mission and guided by the unshakable belief that a great idea can change the world. Looking ahead, we'll continue to manage for the long term, always pushing the limits of what's possible and always putting the customer at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $81.8 billion, down 1% from last year and better than our expectations despite nearly 4 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. We set June quarter records in both Europe and Greater China and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets driven by iPhone. Products revenue was $60.6 billion, down 4% from last year, as we faced FX headwinds and an uneven macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, driven by a June quarter record for iPhone switchers and high new-to rates in Mac, iPad and Watch, coupled with very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $21.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and grew double digits in constant currency. Our performance was strong around the world as we reach all-time Services revenue records in Americas and Europe and June quarter records in Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.5%, a record level for the June quarter and up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards Services, partially offset by a seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 35.4%, down 130 basis points from last quarter due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 70.5%, decreasing 50 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.4 billion were below the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and decelerated from the March quarter. We continue to take a deliberate approach in managing our spend with strong focus on innovation and new product development. The results of these actions delivered net income of $19.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.26, up 5% versus last year, and very strong operating cash flow of $26.4 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year but grew on a constant currency basis. We set revenue records in several markets around the world, including an all-time record in India and June quarter records in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.K. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, thanks to a June quarter record in switchers. This is a testament to our extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at 98% for the iPhone 14 family in the U.S. Mac generated $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our Mac portfolio. And this past quarter, we were pleased to complete the transition to Apple silicon for the entire lineup. This transition has driven both strong upgrade activity and a high number of new customers. In fact, almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product. We also saw reported customer satisfaction of 96% for Mac in the U.S. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion, down 20% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air launch in the prior year. At the same time, we continue to attract a large number of new customers to the iPad installed base with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, with a June quarter record in Greater China and strong performance in several emerging markets. We continue to see Apple Watch expand its reach with about 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And this is combined with very high levels of customer satisfaction, which was recently reported at 98% in the United States. Moving on to Services. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $21.2 billion with year-over-year growth accelerating sequentially to 8% and up double digits in constant currency. In addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we also set June quarter records for advertising, App Store and Music. We are very pleased with our performance in Services, which is a direct reflection of our ecosystem's strength. First, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. Second, we see increased customer engagement with our services. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Third, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. This past quarter, we reached an important milestone and passed 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only 3 years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services. From 20 new games on Apple Arcade, to brand-new content on Apple TV+, to the launch of our high-yield savings account with Apple Card, our customers are loving these enhanced offerings. Turning to the enterprise market. Our customers are leveraging Apple products every day to help improve productivity and attract talent. Blackstone, a global investment management firm, is expanding its Apple footprint from their corporate iPhone fleet to now offering the MacBook Air powered by M2 to all of their corporate employees and portfolio companies. Gilead, a leading biopharmaceutical company, has deployed thousands of iPads globally to their sales team. Over the last 6 months, they have also doubled their Mac user base by making MacBook Air available to more employees with a focus on user experience and strong security. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $7.5 billion in maturing debt while issuing $5.2 billion of new debt and increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $109 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $24 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 103 million Apple shares. We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Saori referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of over 2 percentage points. We expect iPhone and Services year-over-year performance to accelerate from the June quarter. Also, we expect the revenue for both Mac and iPad to decline by double digits year-over-year due to difficult compares, particularly on the Mac. For both products, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter a year ago and were able to fulfill significant pent-up demand in the year ago September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 45%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on August 17, 2023, to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSaori Casey: Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We will go ahead and take our first question from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross: Tim, you mentioned -- and actually, Luca, too, you mentioned an uneven macro environment during the quarter several times on the call. I'm wondering if you can talk on a geographic basis about some of the trends you're seeing in iPhone. I'm specifically wondering how demand is trending within...\nLuca Maestri: Sure. Shannon, I'll answer it. I didn't get the end of your question.\nOperator: I think she has dropped.\nLuca Maestri: Okay. Well, let me answer the question for the part that I could follow. So on a geographic basis, we've had great performance for iPhone in emerging markets. We set June quarter records in many of the emerging markets. We grew in total double digits. And the performance was strong across the board in emerging markets from China, where our performance improved from minus 3% to plus 8% in the June quarter and we grew double digits in constant currency, to many other areas around the world from India, where, again, we set a June quarter record with very strong performance there, Indonesia, Southeast Asia, in general, Latin America, Middle East. And so it's been really good there. We -- also, as you can see from our geographic segments, we had a slight acceleration of performance in the Americas, primarily in the United States, but we declined there because the smartphone market has been in a decline for the last couple of quarters in the United States.\nShannon Cross: Sorry about that. I'm not sure why I cut off. In terms of gross margin, you were at the high end of the range [Technical Difficulty] and you guided to 45% at the high end, which is, I think, higher than I remember in 20 years of covering you. So how should we think about puts and takes of gross margin? And it seems like there's like a perfect storm of good things. So I just -- maybe if you can talk about how you're thinking about it more holistically.\nLuca Maestri: I think you remember correctly, Shannon, because the 44.5% for the June quarter is an all-time record for us in June. We were up 20 basis points sequentially. It was driven by cost savings and a mix shift towards Services, which obviously helps company gross margins, partially offset by the seasonal loss of leverage. We have a commodity environment that is favorable to us. Our product mix is quite strong at this point. And so with the exception of foreign exchange, which continues to be a drag, and it was a significant drag on a year-over-year basis, yes, we are in a good position right now. We are in a good position for the June quarter. And as I mentioned, we expect similar level of gross margins for the same reasons, frankly, for the September quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Luca, can you just give us a little more color around the guidance? Your overall revenue performance, you called out similar. Obviously, you absorbed a higher FX impact this quarter versus your guide. And you also noted Services acceleration. So just wondering, when you think about that comment on iPhone acceleration, is that on a reported basis? Is that constant currency basis? And is there something that's changing in terms of seasonality perhaps for you that is causing not as much step-up in product revenue as typical on a sequential basis? And I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So all our comments are in reported currency, not in constant currency in relation to the outlook. And we said acceleration sequentially for iPhone and for Services. But we're also pointing out -- and this is where I think, Wamsi, you're referring to some seasonality issues. We also said that for Mac and iPad, we expect to decline double digits. And the reason for that is that we have a very difficult compare versus last year. You remember that a year ago, in the June quarter, we had factory shutdowns for both Mac and iPad. And so we were able to fill the pent-up demand from those shutdowns during the September quarter. So an unusual level of activity that we had a year ago. And so now, obviously, the compare is difficult. So we expect both iPad and Mac to be down double digits, which offset the acceleration that I mentioned for iPhone and Services.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. And Tim, I was wondering if you could update us on what percent of iPhones are sold on some type of installment basis now versus full upfront payment on a global basis. And maybe some thoughts on if you expect similar promotional activity from carriers, especially in the U.S., that seem to be grappling with a lot of cash flow issues this particular year.\nLuca Maestri: Wamsi, I'll take it. We've done a really good job over the last few years with affordability programs around the world directly in our direct channel and with our partners around the world. The majority of iPhones, at this point, are sold using some kind of a program, trade-ins, installments, some kind of financing. And that percentage, which again, it's well over 50%, is very similar across developed and emerging markets. We want to do more of that because we think it really helps reduce the affordability threshold for our products. And we think it is also one of the reasons why our product mix has been very strong during the last couple of cycles. So we will continue to push on that front.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS.\nDavid Vogt: I just wanted to follow up on 2 points that both you, Tim, and Luca made about growth and maybe commodities. So just to be clear, I know you're talking about an acceleration in iPhone, but the comp is about 2 points easier from FX. So I just want to understand, is that on a like-for-like basis, excluding the currency improvement of about 2 points from the June quarter to the September quarter? And from a commodity perspective, I know last quarter, you talked about buying a lot of inventory at favorable prices, which was an incredibly smart strategy. Where do you sit today? And what's sort of the timing or the duration of that commodity sort of backlog that you have as we think about next quarter and the subsequent quarters? How far does that get you out into the future from this favorable cost dynamic?\nLuca Maestri: Let me start again. I just want to be clear about the guidance, the outlook guidance that we provided. We're referring entirely to reported numbers. So they take into account the fact that we have a slight improvement in foreign exchange. So when I talk about similar performance, I refer to reported performance in the June quarter and then the reported performance in the September quarter. And again, we expect, on a reported basis, our iPhone performance to accelerate, our Services performance to accelerate, and iPad and Mac to decline double digits. On the commodity front, as I mentioned, the environment is favorable. We always make sure that we take advantage of the opportunities that are available in the market, and we will continue to do that going forward.\nDavid Vogt: Luca, any sense of how long that gives you a run rate today based on what you currently have? Can you give us a sense for at least the short-term tailwind?\nLuca Maestri: I don't want to speculate past the September quarter because that's the horizon where we provide guidance. And I've said that the guidance for September is 44% to 45%, which you know is historically very high. And so obviously, that reflects a favorable environment for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: I have 2 as well. Maybe if we just start kind of big picture, Tim or Luca. I was wondering if you could just kind of share some incremental color on how you think the consumer is behaving today versus 90 days ago and maybe how that differs by region. Meaning, are there any signs that consumer is incrementally more willing to spend on things like consumer electronics? Or is there still relative caution in the market? Are there any regions where you're seeing more strength in the consumer? And how sustainable do you think some of that strength or weakness could be based on some of the KPIs you track? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes. David, it's Tim. If you sort of step around the world, we did exceptionally well in emerging markets last quarter and even better on a constant currency basis. And so emerging markets were -- was a strength. If you look at China, in China, we went from a negative 3% in Q2 to a plus 8% in Q3. And so in China, we had an acceleration. If you look at the U.S., which is in the -- obviously in the Americas segment, it is the vast majority of what's in there, there was also a slight acceleration sequentially, although the Americas is still declining somewhat year-over-year, as you can see on the data sheet. The primary reason for that is that it's a challenging smartphone market in the U.S. currently. And then in Europe, Europe saw a record quarter and -- for the June quarter, a record. And so some really good signs in most places in the world.\nErik Woodring: Awesome. And then maybe, Luca, a question for you. I think it's been about 3 quarters now where we've seen OpEx either grow below historical seasonality or come in below your expectations. I think this is the first time we've seen R&D grow less than 10% year-over-year since fiscal 2Q 2007. So can you maybe just talk about some of the cost actions you're taking? And as you look forward, what are the indicators that you're really evaluating that would give you greater confidence in perhaps returning back to a more seasonal cadence of OpEx spending? Or is this just a new normal that we should be expecting? That's it for me.\nLuca Maestri: Obviously, we look at the environment, and we know that this has been an uncertain period for the last few quarters. And so we decided to be deliberate in what we do in terms of controlling our spend, and there's many areas across the company that we're working on and we've been quite effective at slowing down the spend. We slowed down also the hiring within the company in several areas. And we're very pleased with our ability to decelerate some of the expense growth taking into account the overall macro situation. We will continue to manage deliberately. You can see that we continue to grow our R&D costs faster than the rest of the company. SG&A is actually growing at a much slower pace because obviously, our focus continues to be in innovation and product development, and we'll continue to do that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Ng: I just have 2 questions as well. First, it was encouraging to see the Services outperformance in the quarter, up double digits on an FX-neutral basis, and more Services acceleration next quarter on a reported basis. I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about key underlying drivers for the confidence in the Services acceleration next quarter, understanding that FX a little bit. But anything to call out as it relates to things in Apple Search Ads that's helping. You're obviously making a lot of investments in Apple TV+ between MLS and the Canal+ deal. So any thoughts there would be great.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Michael, you're correct. I mean clearly, we've seen an improvement in the June quarter, and we expect further improvement in the September quarter. In June, the performance was across the board. Tim and I mentioned we set records really across the board. We had all-time records in cloud, in video, in AppleCare, in payments and June quarter records in App Store, advertising and Music. So we saw improvement in all our Services categories. We think the situation will continue to improve as we go through September. And that's very positive because not only good for the financial results, but obviously, it shows a high level of engagement of our customers in the ecosystem, which is very important for us. And it's really the sum of all the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. It goes from the fact that our installed base continues to grow, so we've got a larger pool of customers, to the fact that our customers are more engaged as we have more transacting accounts and paid accounts on the ecosystem. And the subscriptions business is very healthy with growth of 150 million paid subscriptions just in the last 12 months. It's almost double to what we had 3 years ago. And of course, we are providing more and more content to our users. And so the combination of all these things gives us good confidence for September.\nMichael Ng: Great. And just as a related follow-up, it's about the hardware installed base and Services ARPU. I was curious when you talked about the Services strength, you talked about the 2 billion-plus installed base. When you think about the opportunity to increase the Services ARPU, do you really think about it internally on a per-active-iPhone user basis or on a per-device basis? Said differently, I'm just curious where you think about -- whether you think there's an incremental opportunity for those users that have multiple devices. Do you really see a big Services ARPU uplift in that respect?\nLuca Maestri: Well, we know that customers that own more than one device are typically more engaged in our ecosystem. And so obviously, they tend to also spend more on the Services front. I would say the biggest opportunity is that we know that there's a lot of customers that we have that are very familiar with our ecosystem. They are engaged in the ecosystem. But still today, they're using only the portion of the ecosystem that is free. And so we think that by offering better content and more content over time, we're going to be able to attract more of them as paid customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: I have 2 as well. I guess, Luca, maybe if you can talk about Wearables a bit. The growth over there, I think, in constant currency was fairly impressive at plus 6%. Can you just touch on maybe what's driving that? And then how do we think about the Wearables segment heading into the September quarter? I know you talked about a bunch of other ones, but how do we think about Wearables into September as well?\nLuca Maestri: Sorry, Amit, I didn't get the -- what are you referring to?\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Sorry. I was hoping you could talk a bit about the Wearables segment because the growth over there was fairly impressive. And then how do you think about it into September as well?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. On the Wearables front, we had really good performance in Greater China. And that's, again, very important for us. It was a June quarter record for Greater China. Very important for us because, again, it shows that the engagement with the ecosystem in a market that is so important for us like China continues to grow. It means that there's more and more customers that are owning more than the iPhone. Also, we continue to grow the installed base of the category very quickly because, as I mentioned, 2/3 of every buyer of Apple Watch during the course of the June quarter was new to the product. And so that is all additive to the installed base. So it's just great to see that the AirPods continue to be a great success in the marketplace for us. And so things are moving in the right direction there. It's become a very large business for us in Wearables, Home and Accessories. The last 12 months, we've done $40 billion of business, which is nearly the size of a Fortune 100 company. So it's become very important, and it's allowed us to diversify both our revenues and our earnings.\nAmit Daryanani: That's really helpful. And then if I could just follow up, the Europe growth, the growth in Europe at up 5% is totally notable as well. I think you have a few emerging markets that you put in Europe as well. But I would love to understand what's happening in Europe and if there's a way to think about sort of Western Europe or developed world versus emerging markets over there.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. It's been very good, primarily on the emerging market side of Europe. We include India and the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe into the Europe segment. But as we mentioned at the beginning of the call, we had a number of markets that did very well, like France, like Italy, the Netherlands, Austria. So it was a good quarter for Europe.\nOperator: Our next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar: I have one for Luca and then later on one for Tim. So Luca, for some time now, for many quarters, you've had a currency headwind or foreign exchange currency headwind. It's conceivable that as rates start to come down, hopefully next year that the dollar weakens. Could you take us through the mechanism of how that will work on your revenues and for your costs?\nLuca Maestri: So we tend -- we try to hedge our foreign exchange exposures because we think it's the right approach for the company in terms of minimizing the volatility that necessarily happens from the movements of currencies. We cannot effectively hedge every single exposure around the world because in some cases, it is not possible. In other cases, it is prohibitively expensive. But we tend to cover all the major currency payers that we have. About 60% of our business is outside the United States. So it's a very, very large and, I would say, very effective hedging program. And so we set up these hedges, and they tend to roll over very regularly. And then we replace them with new hedges at the new spot rate. So the impact that we're going to have on revenue and cost will depend on where the spot rates are at different points in time. And therefore, because of the way the program works, tends to be a bit of a lag in both directions as the foreign exchange moves over time.\nHarsh Kumar: Understood. Very helpful. And for Tim, Tim, historically, for the last many years, carriers in at least the U.S., which I think is your largest market for iPhone, have had programs to help folks upgrade, whether they give a cash rebate or you bring in your old phone, something like that. I was curious, as you get into your peak December quarter, if you're aware of these programs are in place. And the reason why I'm asking is I think earlier, you mentioned that more than 50% of your phones are sold through some kind of program. I assume the number is even higher in the U.S.\nTim Cook: I don't want to get into revealing specifics in the different carriers. But generally speaking, I would think that it would be quite easy to find a promotion on a phone, provided you're hooking up to a service and either switching services, carriers or upgrading your phone at the same carrier. I think both of those cases today that you can find promotions out there, and I would expect that you'd be able to do that in the December time frame as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: I have two as well. So first of all, I just want to kind of ask Tim. Strategically, as we think about the Services growth and kind of the content expansion behind that, I'm curious if you could help us maybe appreciate what you've seen from a sporting perspective in terms of the engagement with MLS, the engagement with Major League Baseball, and how strategically you're thinking about expansion in sports as a key driver of Services growth going forward.\nTim Cook: We're focused on original content, as you know, with TV+. And so we're all about giving great storytellers the venue to tell great stories and hopefully get us all to think a little deeper. And sport is a part of that because sport is the ultimate original story. And for MLS, we're -- we could not be happier with how the partnership is going. It's clearly in the early days, but we are beating our expectation in terms of subscribers, and the fact that Messi went to Inter Miami helped us out there a bit. And so we're very excited about it.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious, an update on -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks the continued growth that you've seen in India. I'm curious how we think about that market opportunity looking forward. Is there anything that you see evolving that could accelerate the opportunity for iPhone in that large mobile market?\nTim Cook: We did hit a June quarter revenue record in India, and we grew strong double digits. We also opened our first 2 retail stores during the quarter. And it's -- of course, it's early going currently, but they're currently beating our expectation in terms of how they're doing. We continue to work on building out the channel and putting more investment in our direct-to-consumer offers as well. And so I think if you look at it, it's the second largest smartphone market in the world. And it's -- so we ought to be doing really well there. And where I'm really pleased with our growth there, we're still -- we still have a very, very modest and low share in the smartphone market. And so I think that it's a huge opportunity for us. And we're putting the -- all of our energies in making that occur.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Your -- I just wanted to ask about the AI side of things. Your strategy on AI seems quite different than many of your peers, at least you don't talk too much about that, how much you invest in it. Maybe you can elaborate a little bit on that. But related to that, how do you see your investment in this area turning into financial performance in the future? Is it mainly through faster upgrade cycle, maybe higher ASP? Or are you thinking about maybe additional services that you can capitalize on that? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: If you take a step back, we view AI and machine learning as core fundamental technologies that are integral to virtually every product that we build. And so if you think about WWDC in June, we announced some features that will be coming in iOS 17 this fall, like Personal Voice and Live Voicemail. Previously, we had announced lifesaving features like fall detection and crash detection and ECG. None of these features that I just mentioned and many, many more would be possible without AI and machine learning. And so it's absolutely critical to us. And of course, we've been doing research across a wide range of AI technologies, including generative AI for years. We're going to continue investing and innovating and responsibly advancing our products with these technologies with the goal of enriching people's lives. And so that's what it's all about for us. And as you know, we tend to announce things as they come to market, and that's our MO, and I'd like to stick to that.\nSidney Ho: Okay. That's fair. Maybe as a follow-up is related to -- you talked about WWDC, where you actually introduced Vision Pro there. Clearly, a very big announcement there. How should we think about the revenue ramp related to the Vision Pro? Is there any catalysts that we should be thinking about that will drive an inflection of that product?\nTim Cook: Yes. There's enormous excitement around the Vision Pro. We're excited internally. Everybody that's been through the demos are blown away, whether you're talking about press or analysts or developers. We are now shipping units to the developer community for them to begin working on their apps. And we're looking forward to shipping early next year. And so we could not be more excited with that. I'm using the product daily. And so we're not going to forecast revenues and so forth on the call today, but we're very excited about it.\nOperator: We will take our last question from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: I have two of them as well. Number one, on iPhone, Tim, you mentioned about the record number of switchers in the quarter. I'm kind of curious how to think about, given the weak macro and consumer spending, how is the replacement cycle for iPhone? Is it similar, longer, shorter versus prior years? And can you talk a little bit about the demand linearity of iPhone during the June quarter? And then I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Switchers were a very key part of our iPhone results for the quarter. We did set a record. We set a record in Greater China, in particular, and it was at the heart of our results there. And we continue to try to convince more and more people to switch because of our -- the experience and the ecosystem and -- that we can offer them. And so I think switching is a huge opportunity for us. In terms of the upgrade cycle and so forth, it's very difficult to estimate real time what is going on with the upgrade cycle. I would say, if you think about the iPhone results year-over-year, you have to think about the SE announcement in the year ago quarter, the iPhone SE announcement in the year ago quarter. And so that provides a bit of a headwind on the comp. But as Luca said, as he talked about how we're viewing Q4, the September quarter, we see iPhone accelerating in Q4.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then my final question is on your retail stores, you obviously have a very large retail footprint and many of your stores seem to have been open for over a year now. How is the foot traffic there? And how do you think about sales or the retail trends in the June quarter and implications for the back half of this year on a seasonality basis?\nTim Cook: I'm sorry, are you talking about our retail stores?\nKrish Sankar: Yes, yes, your retail stores.\nTim Cook: Yes. The -- if you look at retail, it's a key part of our go-to-market approach, and it will be so key and such a competitive advantage with Vision Pro. It will give us the opportunity to launch a new product and demo to many people in the stores. And so it has many advantages in it. And we continue to roll out more stores. As you know, we just opened 2 in India last quarter. We're -- there's still a lot of countries out there that don't have Apple stores that we would like to go into. And so we continue to see it as a key part of how we go to market and love the experience that we can provide customers there.\nSaori Casey: A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, at a webcast of apple.com/investor and via telephone.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $94.8 billion for the March quarter, which was better than our expectations. We set an all-time record for Services and a March quarter record for iPhone. We were particularly pleased with the performance we saw in emerging markets and achieved all-time records in Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE, as well as a number of March quarter records, including in Brazil, Malaysia and India. This result is a testament, first and foremost to our teams around the world who are engaged every day in the work of bringing new innovations to life. It speaks to the incredible power of Apple products and services to enrich people's lives in indispensable ways. And whether it's in the design lab in Cupertino, or in one of the brand new retail stores in India, I am constantly inspired by the way our people come together to make a real difference in the world. During the March quarter, we continued to face foreign exchange headwinds, which had an impact of more than 500 basis points, as well as ongoing challenges related to the macroeconomic environment. Revenue was down 3% year-over-year as a result, while on a constant currency basis, we grew in total and in the vast majority of the markets we tried. Despite these challenges, we continue to manage for the long term and to push the limits of what's possible, always on behalf of the customers who depend on our products whether it's students exploring new frontiers, developers dreaming up their next big idea, or artists taking their creativity to a whole new level. Let me share how these results showed up across our lineup of products and services. Let's start with iPhone, which set a new March quarter record with revenue of $51.3 billion. The iPhone 14 and 14 plus continue to delight users with their long lasting battery and advanced camera. And our pro users continue to rave about the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone. This March, we were excited to expand emergency SOS via satellite to six new countries, bringing this important safety feature to even more users. We now offer this vital service in 12 countries, and I'm grateful for every note I've received from around the world about the life saving impact of our safety features. Now let's turn to Mac, which recorded $7.2 billion in revenue for the March quarter in line with our expectations. As we noted during our last call, Mac faced a very difficult compare because of the incredibly successful rollout of our M1 chip throughout the Mac lineup last year. And like our other product lines, Mac is facing some macroeconomic and foreign exchange headwinds as well. That said, the advancements we've made in power efficient performance continue to amaze our users. Our M2 Mac Mini customers are raving about the pro level powerhouse packed into an ultra-compact design, and users are marveling at the power and speed at the heart of every M2 powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which allowed them to sustain even the most demanding workloads. iPad revenue was $6.7 billion, which was also in line with our expectations. Similar to Mac, iPad revenue performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges, foreign exchange headwinds, and a difficult compare with last year when we launched the M1 powered iPad Air. iPad's versatility continues to be its greatest strength as we're helping students learn on the same family of devices artists use to create their next masterpiece. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue was $8.8 billion. With its exceptional range of game changing health and safety features, Apple Watch becomes more and more indispensable every day. Apple Watch Ultra is attracting adventures, athletes and everyday users with its breakthrough features built for endurance and exploration. And with summer travel season soon heating up, there's no better companion in the air or on the road than AirPods, the best and most popular headphones in the world. Meanwhile, Services set an all-time record with $20.9 billion in revenue for the March quarter. We achieved all time revenue records across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and payment services. And now, with more than 975 million paid subscriptions, we're reaching even more people with our lineup of services. Apple TV Plus continues to draw praise from customers and reviewers alike. During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series like Shrinking and The Big Door Prize and got to welcome Ted Lasso back into their homes for a third season. Movies like Tetris are captivating viewers with many more to come, including Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon later this year. Three years since its launch, Apple TV Plus programming has been celebrated across the globe, with over 1,450 nominations and more than 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, which won an Academy Award for best Animated Short Film. The first season of our historic tenure partnership with Major League Soccer is well underway with MLS season pass, we've created the ultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the ability to watch every match with no blackouts. And with baseball season in full swing, Apple TV Plus subscribers can watch their favorite teams with the return of Friday night baseball. This quarter, we launched Apple Music Classical, a standalone app that gives something special to classical music lovers. Apple Music Classical packs the largest library of classical music on Earth into a thoughtful and intuitive design that strikes all the right notes. Whether you're listening with AirPods or HomePod, the premium sound experience of Apple Music Classical will leave you with a feeling of being front row at the symphony just behind the conductor. In March, we also launched Apple Pay Later designed with users privacy and financial health in mind. Apple Pay Later allows users to split purchases into multiple payments with no interest or fees. And last month, we introduced Apple Card Savings Accounts to give users even more value out of their daily cash Apple Card Benefit. At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than retail, where our teams are dedicated to sharing the best of Apple with our customers. And we're constantly innovating to deliver exceptional experiences and meet our customers where they are. In the US, we launch Shop with a specialist over video, a new way for customers to learn about iPhone and find the one that's just right for them. And as I noted earlier, in a milestone for Apple, we just opened our first two Apple stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. I was there to see it for myself, and I couldn't have been more delighted by the excitement and enthusiasm of the customers, developers, creators and team members I got to spend time with. I've had the chance to connect with customers and teams all around the world in recent months, so many people shared with me that they were fans of Apple, not just because of the innovations we create, but because of the values that guide us, and that means a great deal to us. We're constantly striving to make a positive difference in people's lives and be a force for progress. We're investing in education to give students the skills they need to shape the future. We're helping to create pathways of opportunity for communities of color through our Racial Equity and justice initiative. And every day we're building an even more inclusive and diverse Apple rooted in our culture of belonging. To better understand how our work intersects with our values, look no further than what we're doing for the environment. We just celebrated Earth Day in April, and during that month, Apple announced that its global manufacturing partners now support over 13 gigawatts of renewable energy, a nearly 30% increase in just the last year. This translates to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. We're all investing up to an additional $200 million in our Restore Fund, which is designed to support innovative, scalable, nature based carbon removal projects, with the goal of removing 1 million metric tons of carbon every year. These are just the latest steps on our journey toward our 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our supply chain and lifecycle of our devices. At the same time, we're advancing renewable energy across our supply chain, we're also sourcing more recycled materials in our products. Last month, we announced our plans to have all Apple design batteries include 100% certified recycled cobalt by 2025, and we remain committed to one day using only recycled and renewable materials in our products. We have a deep sense of mission here at Apple. We believe in the power of innovation to build a better world. We are determined to do our best work on behalf of our customers and to give them the tools that can enrich lives. So we will manage for the long term, just as we always have, with our eyes to the horizon, with limitless creativity, and with a deep belief that we can achieve anything we put our minds to. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $94.8 billion, down 3% from last year and better than our expectations. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over five percentage points on our results, in line with what we had expected. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. In addition to the records in emerging markets that Tim mentioned, we also set March quarter records in Australia, Canada, Spain and Switzerland, among others. Products revenue was $73.9 billion, down 5% from last year, due to challenging compares on Mac and iPad. iPhone, however, reached a March quarter revenue record thanks to very strong performance in emerging markets from South Asia and India to Latin America and the Middle East. During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continued to grow at a nice pace thanks to extremely high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, on top of growing 17% in the March quarter a year ago. We reached an all-time services revenue record in Greater China and March quarter records in Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.3%, up 130 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards services partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.7%, decreasing 30 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 71%, up 20 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.7 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and continued to decelerate from the December quarter. We are closely managing our spend, but remain focused on long term growth with continued investment in innovation and product development. Net income was $24.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were a $1.52, unchanged versus last year, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a March quarter record of $51.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year despite significant foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We set March quarter records in several developed and emerging markets with India, Indonesia, Turkey and the UAE doubling on a year-over-year basis. Our active installed base of iPhone grew to a new all-time high and was up in all our geographic segments. We are very pleased by the results of the latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research, which measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion, down 31% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment coupled with a difficult compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined M1 MacBook Pros. Despite this, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments and we continue to see strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Also, the latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research reported customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac. iPad generated $6.7 billion in revenue, down 13% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. This performance was due to two key factors, a tough compare against the launch of iPad Air powered by the M1 chip in the year ago quarter and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments thanks to exceptional customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year-over-year as the category experienced the impact from the macroeconomic environment. However, we did set March quarter records both in the US and in Greater China. We continue to see strength in our Watch installed base, which set a new all-time record, thanks to very high customer loyalty and new two rates, nearly two thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to Services, we reached a new all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion. And in addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we set March quarter records for advertising Apple Care and Video. Despite these records, as we saw in recent quarters, certain services offerings such as digital advertising and mobile gaming continue to be affected by the current macroeconomic environment. Stepping back, however, the continued growth in Services is the reflection of our ecosystem strength and the positive momentum we are seeing across several key metrics. First, our growing installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. We continue to grow across every major product category and geographic segment, thanks to very high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. Third, paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We now have more than $975 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings from new content on Apple TV Plus to great new features available in Apple Pay and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love. Turning to the enterprise market, we see business customers continuing to invest in the Apple platform to drive higher employee productivity and satisfaction. In Brazil, Boticario Group, the world's largest cosmetics franchiser, originally starting with iPhone, 12 employees manage operations across a network of retail stores, franchisees and resellers. As it continues to digitize its business, Boticario has chosen to move all software development in house and adopted Mac as the standard device for all of their developer teams across the world. In small business, we see an increasing number of customers relying on Apple hardware, software and services to power their businesses forward, from accepting payments on iPhone, to tracking inventory on Mac or iPad, to managing employee devices with Apple Business Essentials. As we celebrate National Small Business week here in the US, we are proud to continue supporting the small business community. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by about $300 million, leaving us with total debt of $110 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the March quarter, we returned over $23 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19.1 billion through open market repurchases of $129 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.24 a share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of nearly four percentage points. For Services, we expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the March quarter, while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion. We expect OINE to be around negative $250 million excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on May 18, 2023, to shareholders of record as on May 15, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much for taking the questions. Tim, maybe if we start with you. If we go back to the December quarter and the shutdowns, the production shutdowns around the time I think the question a lot of us were asking was how should we think about the deferral of demand versus destruction of demand? March quarter was quite strong 2% year-over-year iPhone growth. And so as we sit here in May, how have you seen that customers that weren't able to purchase during the December quarter behave? Meaning, are you seeing that they deferred purchases to March and June? Could they be deferring purchases to later and hopes of buying a new iPhone? Just how should maybe we think about the cadence of that and then I have a follow up. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Yes. Hi, Erik. It's hard to quantify this, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter as we did see the iPhone performance accelerate relative to the December quarter. The production levels for the whole quarter were where we wanted them to be. So supply was not an issue during Q2.\nErik Woodring: Okay, perfect. Thank you for that color. And then, Tim, maybe to follow up, it's been three or four quarters now that you've mentioned emerging markets like India and others. And I imagine, having just opened two new stores in the country, clearly an important market for you. So maybe can you just talk about why you see India as such an important market and others, how you think about monetization trends in the country and specifically what you have to do within the country to really ensure that India becomes maybe a more material mix of your business? And that's it for me. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yes, sure. Looking at the business in India, we did set a quarterly record, grew very strong, double digits year-over-year. So it was quite a good quarter for us, taking a step back, India is an incredibly exciting market. It's a major focus for us. I was just there, and the Dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable. Over time, we've been expanding our operations there to serve more customers, and three years ago, we launched the Apple Store online, and then, as you just mentioned, we launched two stores just a few weeks ago, and they're off to a great start, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. We've got a number of channel partners in the country as well that we're partnering with, and we're very happy with how that's going overall. Overall, I couldn't be more delighted and excited by the enthusiasm I'm seeing for the brand there. There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it's great to be there. On other emerging markets, we had a stellar quarter in emerging markets overall, as I had mentioned, with records set in a number of different places, including Indonesia and Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE, and then quarterly records in Brazil, India and Malaysia. And so it was a great quarter for emerging markets in general, despite the headwinds of the currency that Luca mentioned. And so we're putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, et cetera, a great opportunity for us in those markets.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs.\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. It was encouraging to hear about the record installed base across iPhone and across all devices. It's been, I think, double digit growth over the last few years across the active devices. I was just wondering, is that a good way to think about the installed base growth going forward? And then for the iPhone installed base specifically, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of texture around how you think about the growth there, whether regionally or by first, smartphones versus switchers. And then I have a quick follow up.\nTim Cook: Yes. If you look at the installed base of active devices now, overall it's more than $2 billion. As you know, we announced in January that we surpassed that. And this quarter, our Q2 rather we set new records across each of the geographic segments and each of the major product categories. And that's despite declines in current quarter sales, in particular in Mac and iPad. This is a huge asset for us, and it's a testament to the overall customer satisfaction and engagement and loyalty of our customers. And so we view this as a major asset for us. The iPhone base is well over a $1 billion active devices. We see this as upgrade rates, and these sorts of things may change quarter-to-quarter depending upon macroeconomic. But if you back up and look at the installed base, we feel great about the size of it and the rate that it's growing.\nMike Ng: Great. Excellent. And then it was also encouraging to see the number of devices per iPhone user continue to grow. I was just wondering if you could talk about the opportunity to continue to increase that number of Apple devices per iPhone user and if you have any color around how the monetization per user may differ from those, for lack of better words, super users versus those that may not be as deep into the ecosystem. Thanks.\nTim Cook: We try really hard to design our products in such a way that they work seamlessly together, and so whether that's the watch or the Mac, so that you can start working on one device and finish it on the other. And so there are a good deal of people out there that have multiple Apple devices, and I think this is a testament to the customer satisfaction and loyalty that we've been able to get from the incredible design that our engineering teams do on our products.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Thank you for taking my question. Tim, can you talk a bit about AI? It's obviously more than the topic of the day. It seems like the topic of the year. Just how you think about it through your products and services. I know you use it in different ways, but also if you can just give us any thoughts you have on generative AI and I don't know where you see it going, not sure what you want to say on it, but I'm really curious for your take. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. As you know, we don't comment on product roadmaps. I do think it's very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things. And there's a number of issues that need to be sorted, as is being talked about in a number of different places. But the potential is certainly very interesting. And we've obviously made enormous progress integrating AI and machine learning throughout our ecosystem and we weaved it into products and features for many years as you probably know. You can see that in things like fall detection and crash detection and ECG, these things are not only great features, they're saving people's lives out there. And so it's absolutely remarkable. And so we are, we view AI as huge and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Thank you. And then can you talk a bit about your shift of manufacturing and diversification of manufacturing footprint? I'm curious. Obviously, you have a very tight network in China. So how is it going to move to some of these other regions? Are you seeing any impact from a margin perspective or just any thoughts you have on what you've seen as you started to shift more and more outside of China? Whether it's growth or it's actual production? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Our supply chain is truly global and we're investing all over the world. We're investing in the US. We're investing in a number of other countries as well. So we make products everywhere. We'll continue to invest everywhere, and we'll continue to look for ways to optimize the supply chain based on what we learn each and every day and week and so forth, to ensure that we can deliver the best products and services for our customers. If you sort of step back and look at how we've performed over the last three years on the supply chain, despite this parade of horribles, if you will, between the pandemic and the chip shortages and macroeconomic kind of factors, the supply chain has been incredibly resilient, and we feel good about what we are and what our plans are.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Tim, you had called out on December quarter earnings that Pro models were significantly constrained. Do you see a catch up on the Pro model specifically in the March quarter? And was the mix better than typical? And do you see that mix renormalizing here in the June quarter? And maybe you can comment on the channel inventory levels as well for iPhones, and I have a follow up.\nTim Cook: Sure. It's hard to quantify Wamsi, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter, and obviously we had to set the channel at the right levels. And we're very comfortable with the channel inventory that we have on a forward basis. So we do think there were some, but it's difficult to quantify it.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim. And Tim, as a follow up, you launched so many services around Apple Pay most recently, you mentioned Buy Now Pay Later high yield savings account. Where do you see the expansion and the payments ecosystem over time? And do you look at the payments ecosystem as a standalone revenue opportunity? Or is it more about making the devices even more inseparable from us? Thank you.\nTim Cook: What we're trying to do with our payments work is that sort of like we've done on the watch, where we're focused on helping people live a healthier day on our financial products. We're helping people have a better financial health and so things like the Apple Card and the fact that it has no fees, like the savings account, which has, as you mentioned, it's very attractive yield. So we're trying to help our users, but these things have to stand on their own, obviously. But we're very user focused, and so we're listening to them at what things provide them pinch points and orchestrate our roadmaps around that. Buy Now Pay Later is another one that we've just gotten out of the shoot. But on the savings account specifically, we are very pleased with the initial response on it. It's been incredible.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt of UBS.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Tim, I just wanted to go back to maybe kind of dig into the restocking of inventory in the channel versus what we're hearing from a demand perspective that appears to be a little bit softer in the March quarter from some of your larger carriers. That exhibited relatively weak upgrade rates. So I just want to kind of get a sense for where you're seeing demand signals today vis-\u00e0-vis how you were thinking about it maybe a month ago or even three months ago. And is there sort of an acceleration in demand or any sort of signals that you might want to share with us at this point? And then I have a follow up.\nTim Cook: I don't want to go into what we're seeing in Q3 other than the guidance that Luca has given. But for Q2, I think you're probably referencing primarily US carriers. And if you look at our geographic distribution of our performance, it was lower in the Americas, which is primarily predominantly the United States. And a part of that is, I believe it's macroeconomic. A part is that there was more promotional activity in the year ago quarter. And so I think that's what you're seeing there, where our results were really stellar during this quarter, was really in the emerging markets, and we couldn't be prouder of the results that we had there.\nDavid Vogt: Great. That's helpful. And then just quickly on Services, are you seeing anything in terms of consumers behavior other than sort of the macro that you mentioned and tough comps on digital advertising and mobile gaming? Are you seeing users of all the disparate services change and what they're using and how they're using it and time spent with an Apple Service? Now that we're technically, hopefully fully past COVID, with China almost fully reopened, I'm just trying to get a sense for how user or consumer behavior has changed over the last three to six months. Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: David, it\u2019s Luca. As you said, of course we got the issue around the macroeconomic environment, particularly in advertising and in mobile gaming, but outside of those areas the behavior of customers continues to be pretty consistent. We are doing particularly well, obviously in some of the services that we've launched more recently, like payments where our growth rates are very strong as the adoption of Apple Pay and Apple Card and now the new services that Tim mentioned, the adoption continues to increase. Cloud is an area that continues to grow very consistently. Users want to store more photos and videos and more content on their devices and so they adopt our cloud services and in general the model in the App Store around paid subscriptions continues to grow very strongly. I mentioned we now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions on the platform and that's almost twice as much what we had only three years ago. So obviously, the growth in subscriptions is very strong.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe I can follow up on David's question here on services. And in the past, pre-pandemic the growth rate there was more about sort of mid-teens. The growth rates today, where you stand, even if I back out FX impact is more about low double digit. So one of the questions that we get often from investors and want to get your thoughts on is even as the installed base growth seems to have accelerated, are these more cyclical drivers that are depressing growth at this point from returning to that level or do you see more of a rollout on the monetization that you have need to do to get back to those growth levels. and I have a follow up, please.\nLuca Maestri: Samik, that the areas where we are seeing the impact on the macroenvironment, as I mentioned, is digital advertising. As you know, obviously the macroenvironment is not helping on that front. And mobile gaming, where we've seen a bit of a slowdown, partly due to the macroenvironment, partly due to the fact that we had very elevated usage during the COVID years. But outside of those areas, we continue to see very healthy growth rates.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And maybe if I can just follow up and this is more of a macro question. I don't know if Luca, you or Tim want to take this, but obviously the macro is not sort of helpful at this point. But what you're sort of implying in terms of your guide is momentum for your products remains pretty stable. You're actually guiding to a modest uptick FX for the overall business. I mean, what are you seeing in terms of customer sort of spending trends? And overall, does the consumer sort of continue to deteriorate in terms of spending patterns? And is your sort of momentum here just a function of share gains? How should we think about sort of where the consumer is versus what your products are doing independent of that?\nLuca Maestri: Part of Samik is what Tim was talking about. We're having great momentum in emerging markets, and those are markets where our share is low, gives us a great opportunity to grow over time. It also helps us with the growth of the installed base, because you can imagine that in places where our market share is low, we tend to add a lot of switchers people that are new to the Apple ecosystem. That increases the install base. And over the longer term, it obviously improves our ability to monetize on services as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: I have to as well. I guess, first off on gross margins for the June quarter. They seem to be holding up fairly well, especially given the fact that sales are going down on a sequential basis. So, Luca, I'm wondering if you can just touch on what's driving the strength in gross margin sequentially. It's offsetting the lack of leverage, if you may. And then I also noticed that the range of your gross margin guide is 50 basis points, it's typically 100. What does that entail? What does that mean?\nLuca Maestri: So you're right. I mean we are guiding to a fairly stable level of gross margins at a very high level. We're very happy with the gross margins that we're having this cycle. For the first time in several quarters, foreign exchange, we expect foreign exchange to be flat on a sequential basis at the gross margin level. Unfortunately, it's still a headwind at the revenue level, but at gross margin level, sequentially, we expect foreign exchange not to be a factor. And so the seasonal loss of leverage that you're referring to, we expect to be offset by cost savings. And so that should give us that level of margins. As you know, you were asking about the 50 basis points. We have guided to 50 basis points of a range before as well, this year in particular, because of the 14th week during the December quarter, we're a bit late in the calendar year, right. And so we have a bit more visibility around margins for the June quarter.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, Tim, if I just go back to the India discussion a bit, perhaps you could just contrast what you're seeing in India at today versus what you saw in China maybe a decade or so ago. Is that a reasonable ramp to think India would have, or could it be different from the lessons you've seen in China?\nTim Cook: I think each country is different and has their own journey, so I hesitate to compare too much. But what I do see in India is a lot of people entering the middle class, and I'm hopeful that we can convince some number of them to buy an iPhone and we'll see how that works out. But right now, it's working out well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar of TD Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question I had is for Tim. Tim, you're primarily been a consumer centric company, but it seems like the line is blurring with the iPhone, iPad, the hardware products being used for corporate applications. So is there a way to segment how much of your revenues today are coming from enterprise versus consumer? And does the slower corporate IT spend impact your outlook for iPhone, iPad, Mac, et cetera, and then I have a follow up.\nTim Cook: Internally, we have our estimates for how much is enterprise versus consumer. And the enterprise business is growing. We have been focusing a lot on BYOD programs and there's more and more companies that are leaning into those and given employees the ability to select which is plays to our benefit, I believe, because I think a lot of people want to use a Mac at work or an iPad at work. And so but we're certainly primarily a consumer company in terms of our revenues, obviously.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, Tim. Thanks for that. And then just as a follow up, obviously a lot of questions on the India retail opening. I'm just kind of curious. You also mentioned that you hope to convert a lot of folks into iPhone there. Where do you think the biggest opportunity? Is it like primarily a hardware business like the iPhone, iPad wearables, et cetera? Or do you think there is a service opportunity in India longer term too? Thank you very much.\nTim Cook: I think there's an opportunity across the board, including in services. Obviously, the ARPUs are lower in India for whether you're talking about TV and movie streaming or music, the ARPUs are much lower than other regions. But if you look at it over a long arc of time, I think there's a good opportunity across the board.\nOperator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first question is that I want to go back to kind of the geographical dynamics. I'm curious, as we all think about the reopening attributes of China, just how you would characterize the shaping of demand you saw through the course of this last quarter and kind of how you're thinking about the impact of that reopening playing out over the next couple of quarters.\nTim Cook: If you look at China, our revenue came in at negative three for the quarter year-over-year, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis, and we also accelerate rated as compared to the December quarter, which, as you know, had 14 weeks in it and was a negative seven on a reported basis. And so we were pleased with how we did and with the acceleration that we saw with the reopening, and we'll see how we do this quarter. But if you look at the top selling smartphones in urban China, based on a survey from Kantar, we have four out of the top five. And I think in all of the third party data I've seen on the market itself, in the smartphone space, we believe we gained share during Q2. So we feel good about it. Also, China has a lot of very good metrics in terms of new buyers. For example, on the Mac, about six out of ten customers are buying the Mac for the first time. Same thing on iPad. If you look over at the watch, it's more than three out of four customers are buying the watch for the first time. And so the buyer metrics, if you will, are very, very good. And our services business hit an all-time record in China during the quarter.\nAaron Rakers: Very helpful, Tim. As a quick follow up, I want to go back to Amit\u2019s question on gross margin. You talked about FX, the lessening impact there. I'm just curious when you look at your gross margin, obviously got mixed attributes, kind of potentially continuing to drive that higher. But I'm curious on the current environment, how you would characterize the component pricing dynamics and what you're thinking about in this current quarter's Guidance.\nLuca Maestri: The environment on the component side is favorable. We've seen component prices decline during the March quarter, and we expect the same during the June quarter.\nOperator: Our next is from Sydney Ho of Deutsche Bank.\nSydney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you can talk about the linearity of the March quarter and perhaps the first four and a half weeks of the current quarter. It looks like things are slowing down quite a bit elsewhere, but if my math is right, your fiscal third quarter guidance implied product revenue will be a little bit lower than seasonal average on a sequential basis, any color would be helpful. Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: We said that we expect our performance during the June quarter at the revenue level to be similar to the one that we just reported for the March quarter. Keep in mind, we always have differences in the launch timing across our products, and also that especially over the last few years, we've seen a certain amount of supply disruptions. Sometimes it was COVID related, sometimes it was related to specific component shortages. Just to remind you, in the June quarter a year ago, at the full quarter impact of the launch for both of the iPhone SE and the iPad Air, which leads to a more difficult compare. So I think it's important to keep those things in mind.\nSydney Ho: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe a quick follow up. You talk about Apple Pay Later. How has the feedback been so far? And how do you expect the adoption of that service over the next few quarters? Thank you.\nTim Cook: The feedback for both Apple Pay Later and the savings products have both been really good. And we think both of them help customers live a better or healthier financial life. And so we're very excited about the first days of both of them.\nOperator: Our next question is from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar: Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Tim, you're one of the largest chip companies. You're not a component maker. You actually use your own products. But we almost never hear in any context of you guys being a beneficiary, Apple being a beneficiary for either the Chip Act money or the R&D tax credit that's being proposed. I was just curious if you are eligible for any of those. And then I've got a follow up.\nTim Cook: I don't see Apple participating in the Chips Act directly, but we would be a beneficiary indirectly because some of our partners would hopefully be recipients of it and therefore put in additional capacity. And so on that sort of indirect basis, we would have a benefit.\nHarsh Kumar: Understood. And thanks for clarification. Luca, I wanted to clarify your comments about June. When you're saying June performance will be similar to March, I assume on a year-on-year basis, which would be June should be down about two something odd percent. Is that a fair way? And then my question that I wanted to ask, maybe another one for Tim was where do you think is the largest opportunity in your services offering? You're doing a great job, you just set a record. But surely there must be areas where you think you can do better.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. So to your question around the June performance yes, on a year-over-year basis, so comparable to the March quarter on year-over-year basis.\nTim Cook: Harsh, I think we can do better on everything. And so I wouldn't just point to one of them. If you look at the number of active devices and the growth of active devices, I think, our services are underpenetrated in a number of different ways. And so the way that I look at it is there's opportunity in many of them.\nSuhasini Chandramouli : All right. Thank you, Harsh.

Today's call is being recorded.  And now at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nTejas Gala: Thank you. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTimothy Cook: Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us.  Today, we're reporting revenue of $117.2 billion for the December quarter. We set all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India. As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year-over-year. But I'm proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day.  Let me discuss the 3 factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact. On a constant currency basis, we grew year-over-year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track.  The second factor, which we described in a November 6 update was COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continued to prioritize people and worked with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker. Production is now back where we want it to be.  The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances, from inflation to war in Eastern Europe, to the enduring impacts of the pandemic. And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same. We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage for the long term. We adapt quickly to circumstances outside our control while delivering with excellence in the things we can. We invest in innovation, in people and in the positive difference we can make in the world. And we do it all to provide our customers with technology that will enrich their lives and help unlock their full creative potential. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of, and it's so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our customers are loving what we create.  Let me talk now about what we saw across our product categories. Starting with iPhone. Revenue came in at $65.8 billion for the quarter, down 8% year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what users can do with a smartphone.  During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7 billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare because this time last year, we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity for Mac.  Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro and M2 Max. These chips enable unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good for the environment but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac mini, which will supercharge productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful a Mac mini can be.  During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4 billion. The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints. Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it's the new iPad Pro now powered by the M2 or the newly designed iPad 10th Generation with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors.  Revenue for Wearables, Home and Accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year-over-year driven by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category. As an example, a few weeks ago, we announced the next-generation HomePod, which is an indispensable addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We're also helping users make their homes safer with sound recognition. This feature, arriving later this spring, allows HomePod to send a notification directly to a user's iPhone if a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm sound is identified.  We continue to hear wide praise for Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, which has set a new standard for what's possible with a wearable. From a whole host of health and safety features to incredible new capabilities for extreme athletes, there is something for everyone in these amazing products. Customers are excited about some phenomenal new features we've made available across many of our products as well. One of the highlights is emergency SOS via satellite, which launched for iPhone 14 customers in the U.S. and Canada in November and for customers in France, Germany, Ireland and the U.K. in December. This is a feature we hope our users will never need, but it is incredibly heartening to get e-mails from people describing the life-saving impact our new safety features have had on them.  We're always looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate. In December, we released Freeform, a brand-new app that lets users take their ideas wherever they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. Freeform has already received praise from reviewers for its flexibility and simplicity as it works seamlessly across iPhone, iPad and Mac.  Today, we are very excited to announce that we've achieved a truly incredible milestone. Thanks to our deep commitment to innovation, incredible customer loyalty and satisfaction and a large number of switchers, we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base, double what it was just 7 years ago. This is an incredible testament to our products and services and the strength of our ecosystem.  We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services, which was better than what we had expected. We achieved double-digit revenue growth from App Store subscriptions and set all-time revenue records across a number of categories, including cloud and payment services. All told, Apple now has more than 935 million paid subscriptions.  Apple has also just begun a historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer. Just yesterday, we launched MLS Season Pass, which will give fans in more than 100 countries access to every live MLS regular season game as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup, all with no blackouts. And while we're providing more content to sports fans than ever before, Apple TV+ continues to showcase powerful characters and moving storytelling. We were thrilled to celebrate the holidays alongside our Apple TV+ subscribers with the hit movie Spirited. And we're delighted to see how much people are enjoying new and returning series like Shrinking, Slow Horses and Truth Be Told. And we have some great upcoming movies in Sharper and Tetris, along with Emmy Award winner Ted Lasso returning this spring.  During the quarter, we made some great updates to Fitness+ as well, expanding our catalog of more than 3,500 workouts and meditations to include a new kickboxing category and a new sleep theme for meditations. Our latest artist spotlight series features the music of the incomparable Beyonce, and we're excited to take a stroll with guests appearing on our fifth season of Time to Walk. And we continue to build on our decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive when we announced Apple Business Connect. This new tool gives business owners even more control over how billions of people see and engage with their products and services every day. Businesses of all sizes can now customize key information for users across Apple Maps, Messages, Wallet, Siri and other apps.  Meanwhile, in retail, we celebrated 25 years of the Apple online store and also opened Apple Pacific Centre in Vancouver and Apple American Dream in New Jersey. And I'm grateful to all the teams who helped our customers throughout the busy holiday season. At Apple, we spend a lot of time focused on creating an unparalleled experience for our customers and every product and service that we offer. We're also just as dedicated to leading with our values in everything we do. As part of that work, we strengthened our deep commitment to privacy and security, giving users 3 new tools to protect their most sensitive data: iMessage contact key verification, security keys for Apple ID and advanced data protection for iCloud.  At Apple, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to leave the world better than we found it. We're also a year closer to 2030, and we were ever focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade. As an example, the latest Mac mini and MacBook Pro models all use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosure and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. And in a first for HomePod, we're using 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. In honor of Black History Month, we released the Black Unity collection, including the Special Edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a new matching watch face and iPhone wallpaper. Through our racial, equity and justice initiative, we're expanding our support of 5 organizations focused on lifting up communities of color through technology. And we are committed as ever to building on our progress around inclusion and diversity.  During the quarter, we also announced that since the inception of our Giving program 11 years ago, we've donated more than $880 million to humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, childhood education and more. And over the last 16 years through our partnership with (RED), Apple-supported grants have helped more than 11 million people get the care and support services they need.  As we look ahead in 2023, we are excited about the year to come. At Apple, we are always looking forward, always focused on the next challenge, always determined to do great things with unmatched creativity and unrivaled innovation. And that makes me more confident about the future of Apple than I have ever been.  With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points. In other words, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis. And in fact, we did so in the vast majority of markets.  Second, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter was markedly more challenging than 12 months ago. Third, we experienced significant supply shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December. On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter that Tejas just mentioned at the beginning of the call.  Products revenue was $96.4 billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product category. We're proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed base. This continued growth in the installed base is due to extremely strong levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products.  The installed base growth also helped our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion, up 6% over a year ago. We achieved this new milestone despite more than 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached all-time services revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and a December quarter record in Greater China. We also set records in many Services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services, payment services and music and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70 basis points from last quarter due to leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points sequentially. And Services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially, both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin.  Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and grew at a slower pace than in the past as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was $30 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $34 billion.  Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances, we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy and Spain, and saw strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, the installed base of active iPhones continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments.  In emerging markets, in particular, the installed base grew double digits, and we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue to love their experience with our products with the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14 family.  Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. There were 3 key drivers for our Mac results. First, we had a challenging compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Max. Second, we believe that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds. At the same time, however, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Customer satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research.  iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year despite significant FX headwinds. This performance was driven by 2 key items. First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply constraints, while this year, we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product.  Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record thanks to the largest number of customers new to our smartwatch that we've ever had in a given quarter. In fact, nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product.  Moving to Services. We generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in total and for many Services offerings in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment, and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew Services revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year ago.  We remain focused on the large long-term opportunity in this category, and we continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem. For example, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record.  Paid subscriptions also continued to grow nicely. We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last 12 months alone and nearly 4x what we had just 5 years ago.  And we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings. For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions. And we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season.  Finally, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem, and it continues to grow even during difficult macroeconomic conditions, which speaks to the exceptionally high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction and our ability to attract new customers to our platform. The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.  Turning to the enterprise market. we are seeing continued adoption of our Services for business like Apple Business Essentials, AppleCare, Tap to Pay and Apple Financial Services. For example, Mars Incorporated has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant annual savings in the process.  Let me now turn to our capital return program and our cash position. We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $54 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time.  As we move into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.  In total, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the December quarter. This represents an acceleration in our underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited from an extra week. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of 5 percentage points.  For Services, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance. For Mac and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits year-over-year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds.  We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.  Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock payable on February 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023.  With that, let's open the call to questions.\nTejas Gala: Thank you, Luca. [Operator Instructions]. Operator, may we have the first question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from David Vogt with UBS.\nDavid Vogt: So Tim, and maybe this is for Luca as well. You talked about the supply chain returning back to normal after a very difficult October, November, but we're still seeing some disruptions across tech products, whether it's enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or builds that you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow items going forward?\nTimothy Cook: This is Tim, David. From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, we're now at a point where production is what we need it to be. And so the problem is behind us.  In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere. There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world, and the final assembly coming from 3 countries in the world on just iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We'll continue to optimize it over time and change it to continue to improve.  I think when you sort of zoom out and back up from it, the last 3 years have been a pretty difficult time between COVID and silicon shortages and the like. And I think it's -- I think we have had a very resilient supply chain in the aggregate.  In terms of supply for this quarter, which I think was one of your points, I think we're in decent supply on most products for the quarter currently.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross: Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into the commentary on gross margins. The guidance, especially at 43.5% to 44.5%, is obviously quite strong. So I'm wondering what's helping you out there, assume mix and some other things. And then how should we think about what currency and hedge is going to do as we look forward? And then I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Shannon, yes, I mean, we've had good margin for the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December, we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business, but we also had favorable mix across the board.  Of course, foreign exchange is an issue right now. In the December quarter on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months.  For March, yes, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%. We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating. The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully, things will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position on margins.\nShannon Cross: And then, Tim, can you talk a bit about China? What you're seeing -- obviously, you've had the issues with production, but I mean more on the demand side. As we've gotten through Chinese New Year and the opening, I'm just wondering, are you seeing the Chinese consumer come back? What are they buying? And how are you thinking about your position there?\nTimothy Cook: Shannon, last quarter, we declined by 7% on a reported basis, but we actually grew on a constant currency basis. And that was despite some significant -- the supply constraints that we talked about earlier. And obviously, the sort of the COVID restrictions throughout China that happened in various different places throughout the country also impacted the demand during the quarter.  When you look at the opening that started happening in December, we saw a marked change in traffic in our stores as compared to November. And that followed through to demand as well. And I don't want to get into January. We've obviously -- January is included in the guidance, or the color rather, that Luca provided earlier. But we did see a marked change from December compared to November.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: Maybe, Tim, first one for you. That 2 billion installed base -- device installed base figure, that's up, I believe, 200 million units year-over-year. That implies the strongest annual gain in new devices in your installed base basically as far back as you've provided those data points. And so I guess my 2 questions are: one, do you -- can you provide the installed base for the iPhone at year-end? And then two, is there anything that you see in this new cohort of users that might look different or similar to past cohorts, either by demographic or regions or monetization ramp? And then I have a follow-up.\nTimothy Cook: Yes. The installed base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based change. Two -- I'll correct one thing you said, it's up over 150 million year-over-year. The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it's 150 million, which we're very proud of. We also saw strong double-digit in several of the emerging markets, which is very important to us. For example, India and Brazil as just 2 examples. So very, very strong. And obviously, it bodes well for the future.\nErik Woodring: And then, Luca, obviously, the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges. Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of across the iPhone broadly? And then what the data that you're seeing so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind of iPhone demand destruction and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the year rather than into the March quarter? And that's it for me.\nTimothy Cook: Yes. Erik, I'll take that one as well. The channel inventory levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December quarter below our target inventory range because of supply challenges in the year ago quarter. Not related -- not the same issue, but just as a point. And so that hopefully gives you some flavor of that.  In terms of what we're seeing in January, we've included in our color that Luca provided kind of our thinking. It's very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what would have happened and how many people bought down. And it takes a while to get that -- to get those reports in during the quarter. And so we've made our best guess at it.  In terms of the sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate, although not with precision, is that we would -- I thought we believe iPhone would have grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages. So hopefully, that provides you a little bit of color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers: I have two as well, if I can. I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line. Pretty good guidance into this March quarter. I'm curious if you unpack that a little bit specific around what you're seeing as far as maybe benefits from component pricing in the guidance, if you're embedding any of that at this point.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Of course, with our guidance, we try to capture every aspect of our cost structure. And obviously, components are a big portion of that. So definitely, that's included. And keep in mind, again, that foreign exchange -- I mentioned earlier, I think to Shannon, that the sequential negative on FX is 50 basis points, versus a year ago, it's 270 basis points. Obviously, the U.S. dollar has moved a lot over the last 12 months. So obviously, we need to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to be able to provide this kind of guidance. And so obviously, components are a big part of that.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. And then kind of from a strategic perspective, given kind of the things that we're seeing out in some of your peer group, I'm curious, Tim, how you think about the role of AI in your strategy as far as particularly in the Services segment, whether you're not -- you see opportunities to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base and whether or not AI, is it something that you're implementing a bit more strategically there.\nTimothy Cook: Yes. It is a major focus of ours. It's incredible in terms of how it can enrich customers' lives. And you can look no further than some of the things that we announced in the fall with crash detection and fall detection or back a ways with ECG. I mean these things have literally saved people's lives. And so we see an enormous potential in this space to affect virtually everything we do. It's obviously a horizontal technology, not a vertical. And so it will affect every product and every service that we have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: I guess the first one I have is, Tim, I think based on your earlier comments that iPhones would have grown ex the production issue that implied that maybe it's a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from the production challenges on the high-end models. I'm sure it's tough to see what happens this time around. But I think historically, when you've had production issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior being typically? Do they tend to go down towards the lower end models and get the phone they want quickly? Or do they just defer the production? Just from a historical perspective, I think do you typically recover what's deferred out or no?\nTimothy Cook: It's very hard to estimate is the real answer because you have to know a lot of data, and it's usually only in hindsight that you have a more reasonable view of it. And so we put our best views in the color that Luca provided. That's kind of what I would say.\nAmit Daryanani: All right. And then I guess maybe if I think about Services as you go forward. I know you had really good growth in Services, I think, over the last several years. But as you go forward in Services, what do you think drives the growth more so? Is it the expansion of your installed base? Or is it more going to be driven by ARPU going higher for you? I'm just curious, how do you think about those 2 buckets as you go forward?\nLuca Maestri: Amit, there's a number of things, and I've mentioned a few of them during the call. The first step is always the installed base. Installed base is the engine for Services growth. And the fact that the installed base is growing very nicely, and it's growing in a lot of emerging markets, it's growing even faster, that gives us a larger addressable pool of customers. So that's incredibly important.  The second one is that we are seeing that the level of engagement of our customers already in our ecosystem continues to grow. We -- I mentioned that both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits. And so that bodes very well for the future. And we have a lot of transacting accounts that kind of moved to paid accounts over time.  The other aspect that is very important for us is to continue constantly to improve the reach and the quality of our services. And I give the example of Apple Pay, which it's a great example because we started off primarily in the United States. Now we've taken it to 70 markets, millions of merchants. And so obviously, payment services are -- continue to set new highs all the time for us.  And then as you've seen over the last few years, we also launched new services over time, and that obviously contributes to the growth. We're very excited. And when we look at the behavior of our installed base, we think it's very promising for the continued growth of our Services business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar: Tim, I had a quick question on emerging markets. Seems like you're making a lot of strides in India. Potentially wanted to understand the kind of share you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it's units or revenues? And I was hoping to draw on your experience and maybe what you've seen in other countries where you've had some longer presence.\nTimothy Cook: And looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year-over-year. And so we feel very good about how we performed, and that was -- that's despite the headwinds that we've talked about. Taking a step back, India is a hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020. We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there.  We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear. And I don't have the exact market shares in front of me, but I think you would see that from a market share point of view that we grew around the world last quarter despite -- on iPhone despite the challenges that we've had on the supply side. And I wouldn't expect to have a difference in those 2 markets.\nHarsh Kumar: Understood. And for my follow-up, I had a sort of interesting theoretical question on pricing. Assuming we get the CHIPS Act passed, and there's a whole bunch of manufacturing that happens in U.S. and other territories that are potentially somewhat more expensive than the ones you might be now, have you -- has the company done any studies to gauge the elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in your products?\nTimothy Cook: We have experience in that, but I wouldn't necessarily draw the same conclusion that you have in terms of the cost of the product. I -- we don't know at this point exactly what that will be, but we're all in, in terms of being the largest customer for TSMC in Arizona. I'm very proud to take part in that. That's what I would say about that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Tim, you've done a phenomenal job of driving consumer choice towards higher-end products within your portfolio. How would you compare this cycle for iPhones if you were to segment the Pro versus non-Pro models versus the cycles from the past few years? And do you think this move to higher ASPs is sustainable? Or do you think it reverses in a tighter consumer spending environment? And I have a follow-up.\nTimothy Cook: The Pro has been a -- the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max have done extremely well up until the point where we had a supply shortage and couldn't provide them -- couldn't provide the total of the demand. And so it's definitely a strong Pro cycle. I think there's a number of reasons for that, but the most important one is always the product. And I think the innovations and the product speak for themselves. And we feel very good about the product that we announced back in September and are happy to now be at a point where we're shipping to the demand.\nWamsi Mohan: And Tim, do you think that this move to sort of higher ASPs that has happened over the last few years is sustainable? Or could it sustain in this very tough macro environment that you've cited?\nTimothy Cook: I wouldn't want to predict, but I would say that the smartphone for us, the iPhone has become so integral into people's lives. It contains their contacts and their health information and their banking information and their smart home and so many different parts of their lives, their payment vehicle and -- for many people. And so I think people are willing to really stretch to get the best they can afford in that category.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Great. And Tim, you clearly emphasize the focus and importance of the installed base. If we think about the absolute grit of the installed base from 1 billion to 2 billion over 7 years from a device standpoint, how should we think about the penetration of services or the growth in paying customers on services or that time frame? Is that penetration rate increasing or decreasing? How fast is that growing relative to the growth of the overall installed base?\nLuca Maestri: Wamsi, it's Luca. Yes, of course, we keep track of that. It's really important for us. Over the last 7 years, as we doubled the installed base, we've seen a growing engagement of our customers on the platform. That happens, first of all, by customers transacting on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some of the services. That percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time. We've seen it in developed markets. We see it in emerging markets. And that is due to some of the reasons that I was explaining earlier, including the fact that we made it easier for our customers to get engaged on the platform. For example, we offer multiple payment methods in many countries. And we've made it easier to explore for more services because we've added a lot of services on the platform over the last 7 years. So to your question, of course, higher engagement means a higher percentage of paid accounts over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer of Arete Research LLP.\nTejas Gala: Operator, can we move on to the next?\nOperator: Next, we'll hear from Jim Suva of Citigroup.\nJames Suva: Tim and Luca, you both mentioned earlier on the Q&A a little bit about India. I was wondering if we're now entering a situation of even more opportunity because we've exited COVID, we've exited countries with different COVID criteria. We've also seen India build out its higher speed transmissions. And your market is -- shares tremendously underrepresented there. And it appears with the supply chain, you're looking at diversifying kind of operational risk not specific to any country, but just overall. Now you look at potentially opening up stores and stuff. Am I right that, that's the way you look at it is it's even more prime for opportunity now than ever? And once you start opening up stores there, you could just see a complete green shoot of adoptions or any additional commentary on your view on India as now we've navigated COVID and supply chain and so many challenges over the past 2 years?\nTimothy Cook: Yes. Jim, we actually did fairly well through COVID in India. And I'm even more bullish now on the other side of it, or hopefully, on the other side of it. And that's the reason why we're investing there. We're bringing retail there and bringing the online store there and putting a significant amount of energy there. I'm very bullish on India.\nJames Suva: And then as my quick follow-up, you had mentioned that Services, not necessarily specific to India, but Services overall were better than expected. And of course, supply chain was more challenged than expected. So what was the bridge factor of Services being better than expected on upside? Was it like advertising or apps or paid monthly subscriptions? Or what were kind of the things that really surprised you to the upside on Services?\nLuca Maestri: It was -- Jim, it's Luca. It's primarily the -- this level of engagement we saw, which then reflects into the, as you said, the paid subscriptions. We saw very good results in our cloud services business in payment services. Music was very strong. So we had a number of categories that set new records, all-time records. And they did a bit better than we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.  And so Tim mentioned that during, I think, his prepared remarks that when you look at it in constant currency, we grew services double digits. And that was on top of a 24% increase a year ago. So it's very sustained growth that we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company.\nKrish Sankar: I have 2. The first one, Tim and Luca, you mentioned how the macro did soften, and it has an impact. And as consumers tighten their belt, when you look across your hardware products and service businesses, where are you seeing the biggest impact and where are you seeing the least impact from the softening macro? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nTimothy Cook: We think there were some impact across the products and in Services. Probably, the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and Wearables. You can see that in those numbers. And probably, the least would have been iPhone.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a quick follow-up on the Mac. The PC industry is expecting a decline in PC shipments this year also. How do you think about the Mac relative to kind of like where the PC industry as a whole is expecting the shipments to end up? Is there any color you can give on that?\nTimothy Cook: The industry is very challenged, as you say. It's -- the industry is contracting. I think from us, though, is -- and I don't know how this year will play out, so I don't want to predict the year. But over the long run, we have a market that is a reasonable-sized market, a big market. And we have low share, and we have a competitive advantage with Apple silicon. And so strategically, I think we're well positioned in the market, albeit I think it will be a little rough in the short term.\nTejas Gala: A replay of today's call will be available for 2 weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and Services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year-over-year. We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the Rest of Asia Pacific, as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the UK, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today. And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with Private Cloud Compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, with systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December, with even more powerful Writing Tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration, as well as localized English in several countries, including the UK, Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months, as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16, powered by A18, is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. An iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life. Turning to Mac, revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple Silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows, and they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them, whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best Pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible, mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year-over-year. iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini, featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever, while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users, including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition. We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watch in people's lives. With AirPods 4, we broke a new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing test, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives. I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver spatial experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2, as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago, and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the craft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and dive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking. Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows, earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able to buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device. Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers worldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better, with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, and other lenders right at checkout. Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue, where energy and enthusiasm filled the air. And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun. Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, helping with everything from access to technology, to educator resources, to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch. These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term, because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today. He has helped manage Apple for the long term, thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look forward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you, Tim, for the very kind words. Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were a $1.64, up 12% year-over-year, and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the US, the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Urban China, the UK, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family, with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the US. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air. Customers have been loving the performance of Apple Silicon on Mac and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the US. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year. In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, down 3% year-over-year. The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for watch in the US. Our Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. Services continue to see strong momentum with the growth of our installed base of active devices setting a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago. And as always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and pay with installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+. This past quarter, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Apple Card, which was ranked #1 in customer satisfaction among co-branded credit cards by J.D. Power for the fourth year in a row. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees. We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first hospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.6 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $7 billion, leaving us with total debt of $107 billion. As a result, net cash was $50 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow double-digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments. And our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2024 to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two. The first one is for Tim on Apple Intelligence. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on some of the early feedback to Apple Intelligence both for iOS 18.1, but also the developer beta so far, and whether you would attribute Apple Intelligence to any of the strong iPhone performance that we've seen to date. Thanks.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Michael. As I noted in my comments, just this week on Monday, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This includes things like systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural conversational Siri, more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies, simply by typing a description, which is really cool, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, and this will include even more powerful Writing Tools and visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features, as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the UK, Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then, as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out, starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you very much. And my second one just for Luca. First, congratulations again, Luca, on the new role and it's been a real privilege being able to spend some time with you. A question that I think will overlap with your new role as well. Could you just talk a little bit about the CapEx outlook and whether investments in things like Private Cloud Compute could change the historical CapEx range of roughly $10 billion a year? Thank you very much.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Michael. On the CapEx front, I've mentioned before a number of times, we have a bit of a hybrid model in the way we run our data centers. In some cases, we use our own data centers. In some cases, we use, third-party providers. So, our CapEx numbers may not be fully comparable with others. But, obviously, we are rolling out these features, Apple Intelligence features already now, and so we are making all the capacity that is needed available for these features. You will see in our 10-K the amount of CapEx that we've incurred during the course of fiscal '24, and we will -- in fiscal '25, we will continue to make all the investments that are necessary, and of course, the investments in AI-related CapEx will be made.\nMichael Ng: Great. Thank you, Tim. Thank you, Luca.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thanks, Mike. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. And if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down and being more price sensitive? And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: There's a lot there. On Apple Intelligence, we believe it's a compelling upgrade reason. And we'll -- but we just launched it three days ago and so what we've got now from a data point point of view is the number I just referenced that 18.1 has twice the adoption rate of 17.1. So, that clearly shows a level of interest out there. In terms of exiting the December quarter with demand greater than supply, that's not my recollection that, that happened for all four of the years. We clearly had cases during COVID where there were disruptions and that's the some spilled over, but in a more regular environment where we're not having something, a 100-year flood kind of thing, we would -- our desire is to get into balance as quickly as possible. We don't want customers having to wait for products. And so, if you look at how we've done this year, we did that very quickly on the 16, on the 16 Pro family, the Pro and the Pro Max, we've been constrained in October, but we believe that soon we'll be out of constraint. And so, that's a good sign from our point of view. Keep in mind that, that's a function of supply and demand, not one side or the other. And we've been preparing for the quarter for a while. So that's what I would say there.\nErik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah, thank you.\nErik Woodring: And then, Luca, if I just turn to you, obviously, it's been a pleasure working with you, and we wish you all the best in the next role. There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input costs and commodity prices, and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be, or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward? Thanks so much.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Erik. As you know, our gross margins are a factor of many, many variables. Commodities, of course, are important. They're not the only factor. But specifically on commodities, I can tell you that both for the September quarter and what we expect for the December quarter, most commodities are going to move down in price, while NAND and DRAM increased during the course of the September quarter and we expect them to increase during the December quarter. We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year. The entire fiscal year of '24, they're really, for our company, record levels of gross margin, and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products, with all the new features that Tim has talked about, a lot of new products across the board, I think it's a very good sign.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much, Luca.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes from Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. And I'll echo those comments about Luca. Miss you, and good luck. And my question is with regard to iPhone again, and with regard to the fourth quarter, is my first question -- or sorry, the fourth calendar quarter, your first quarter. When you look at mid- to low-single-digit revenue growth, do you expect the iPhone to grow faster? And what are you thinking about in the answer to that question with regard to China, which keeps improving each quarter? Thanks very much. And then, I have just a follow-up. Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Ben, we are not providing that level of color today. Yes, we've said that we expect total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits. Keep in mind, Apple Intelligence, as Tim said, is rolling out over time, both features and languages. And we just had a number of exciting launches just this week from the Apple Intelligence feature to the new Mac. So, we leave it at that. We've given you the total for the company and some pretty good direction on Services, which we expect to continue to grow at a similar rate than what we've seen in fiscal '24.\nBen Reitzes: Great. Thanks, Luca. Hey, Tim, I wanted to ask you, I mean, you guys are well aware a lot of the noise out there, people chattering about builds, lead times, and you guys are guiding for mid- to low-single-digit growth. That certainly doesn't sound like alarm bells here, vis-a-vis what you guys must be hearing. And I know you guys are just running your business and doing the best you can, but you have a lot of perspective now, Tim. What are people missing here? And it certainly just sounds like -- you guys are typically conservative. That guide for revenue is certainly sounds like [this guy is certainly not falling] (ph), and you have a pretty good product cycle. So, what do you think people are missing and what are you excited about? Thanks so much, Tim.\nTim Cook: Ben, I could not be more excited about Apple Intelligence and the rollout that we've got in front of us. I'm on the -- I'm obviously on future releases as well, working on it and it's changing my daily life. I'm super excited about the health features that we're rolling out. If the number of emails I'm already getting from customers that have taken a hearing test and are using their AirPods Pro 2 as a hearing aid, are just -- are staggering and heartwarming to read. I'm also thrilled about sleep apnea and the notification there that we'll have through the watch. This week is a very exciting week for us because we just rolled out three days -- three launches of different, Macs and desktops and laptops. And so, we have a lot of things on the docket and it's definitely the strongest lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season. In terms of the noise, I tune it out, because if not, it would just be, deafening. And so that that's what I do, I can't speak for everybody else, but that's what I do.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Tim. Appreciate it.\nTim Cook: Thanks, Ben.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two as well. And Luca, best of luck in the future. It's been a pleasure working with you. I guess the first one I have is, away from iPhones, on the Services side, you're adding $100 billion run rate with Services today, which is a phenomenal achievement by itself. As you look at the Services portfolio today, can you just talk about how much of this business do you think is reoccurring versus transactional? And are the growth rates different between the subscription portfolio over here versus transactional portfolio?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit, I'll take this one. Yes, we are, first of all, very, very happy with -- it's an important milestone. Of course, we've got to a run rate of $100 billion. You look back just a few years ago, and the growth has been phenomenal. We're very pleased. We've got a very diversified portfolio of services. And over the years, the amount that is recurring in nature has grown and is growing faster than the transactional piece. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions on our platform right now between our own services and third-party services. That continues to grow strong double-digits. So, we feel very, very good. And, essentially, to your question, yes, the recurring portion is growing faster than the transactional one.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. If I can just follow-up, if I look at the growth rates across the different geographies, there's always concern around China when it comes to iPhone demand, I feel, but the performance in September looks fairly good. I wonder if you just touch on, what are you seeing from a demand perspective in China? If the recent stimulus plan in China could essentially be a catalyst for iPhone? And then, EMEA really stood out with double-digit growth. Maybe you can just flush that out as well for us. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah, I'll take the China question. If you look at how we did for the quarter, we were relatively flat year-over-year. And a key component of that improvement relative to the year-over-year performance that we had been achieving is that there was a sequential improvement in foreign exchange. And so that helped us out. As you know, it's been a headwind that we've been reporting for a period of time. And -- but the other parts that are -- what else is going on there is that our installed base of the active devices reached an all-time high. We had the top two selling, smartphones in Urban China according to Kantar. The level of new customers that we have buying the products like Mac and iPad are well over 50%. Watch is over three quarters that are new to the product. And so, there's several positive signs there. In terms of the stimulus, it's a clear focus of the team there, but I'm not an economist and don't want to ad lib on the effect of it.\nLuca Maestri: On the Europe side, Amit, a number of things. As you see from our results during the quarter, Europe grew double-digits, 11%, and really, it was really good growth across the board, the different segments. They all did well. Keep in mind, our definition of Europe in our segment reporting includes a number of emerging markets, like Turkey, where we've grown very strongly, the Middle East. Tim mentioned a number of records in Saudi, in UAE, and we also include India where we set an all-time revenue record during the September quarter. But I have to say also Western Europe grew nicely. So, we've seen very good results for us in the entire segment.\nAmit Daryanani: Great. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks everyone for taking my question, and congratulations, Luca. I know Luca, and I know Tim, you don't want to give a lot of granularity, but if I just try to pull together your comments about what the demand environment looks like, are we to assume based on sort of the commentary that there is a risk that maybe the product revenue portfolio could be down in the December quarter if I take your numbers at face value? And if that's the risk, is that more iPhone-related, Mac-related, given the strength that you've seen in iPad related? Just trying to get a handle on kind of what potentially is giving you that degree of, I don't want to say caution, but maybe balanced for you going into the December quarter. And then, I have a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: As I said, David, we're not providing that level of color. We're giving you some data on services. I would repeat what I said earlier. We're very early in the cycle, very early in the cycle with a lot of new products and features that that we are launching. And we're very excited about them, but it's early. And the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to happen over time, not across the world as normally we do with software releases.\nDavid Vogt: Right. Okay. So maybe a follow-up for, Tim. When you think about to Luca's point about the rollout being staged over the next several quarters across the world, do you think that has any impact on sort of the normal historical demand cadence across different regions? So, should we see something different, let's say, in the December quarter, the March quarter, the June quarter, et cetera, relative to history, given the timing of the rollout and where customers are probably waiting for the devices to be enabled to have the operating system? Would just love to kind of get your perspective on how we think about the demand cadence, how it might be different than maybe historically? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah, David. It's clearly, as you point out, a different cadence, if you will, than we would normally do. As we talked about at WWDC, we wanted to give a comprehensive vision of Apple Intelligence, and we said then that it would rollout over time. And we're right on the, what we said, at WWDC, and so we're executing well. In terms of the demand curve, I would just say that what we believe here is that it's a compelling reason for upgrading. And, it's -- that's both my personal experience and feedback that I'm getting and so we'll see. We're not projecting, beyond the current quarter obviously. We just don't do that.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, Tim, and best of luck, Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Luca, we will miss you on these calls. Tim, maybe for you, as you think about this staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence, can you help us think through potentially how much of the global installed base of phones will have access to Apple Intelligence in their native language, in their region within the next year or maybe in the next two years? And what are some of the gating factors in the rollout? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: If you look at our schedule, we started in the -- with US English, that started on Monday. There's another release coming that adds additional features that I had referenced in December in not only US English but also localized for UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. And then, we will add more languages in April. We haven't set the specifics yet in terms of the languages, but we'll add more in April and then more as we step through the year. And so, we're moving just as fast as possible while ensuring quality. That's what we're doing.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nWamsi Mohan: And then, as a follow-up, maybe this is a little premature, but how is Apple at a high level prepared to potentially deal with any tariffs that might come post the selection cycle? And if not exactly how, perhaps you can just help investors think about some of the things Apple has done already to try to insulate from some of these impacts, potential impacts?\nTim Cook: I wouldn't want to speculate about those sorts of things. And so, I'm going to punt on that one.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Wamsi. May we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. And again, thanks Luca for all your help with analyts and investors. My first question is on R&D. Given how much your tech peers are spending on AI, does this new era of Apple Intelligence actually require Apple to invest more in R&D beyond your current 7% to 8% of sales to capture this opportunity? And then, I had a follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Krish, as you know, we've been investing heavily in R&D over the last several years. Our R&D growth has been significant during the last several years. And obviously, as we move through the course of fiscal '24, we've also reallocated some of the existing resources to this new technology to AI. And so, the level of intensity that we're putting into AI has increased a lot, and you maybe don't see the full extent of it because we've also had some internal reallocation of the base of engineering resources that we have within the company.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks for that, Luca. And then, another quick follow-up. I understand Apple Intelligence is a feature on the phone today, but do you think that, in the future, it could potentially have or benefit the services growth business, or is that too -- are these too bifurcated to even make a call on the [indiscernible]? Thank you.\nTim Cook: I think, just to keep it in mind, Apple Intelligence is also available on the Mac for the M-series products and on certain models of iPad, and in addition to the phone. And so, it's on all three. You're quite -- what was your follow-on question?\nKrish Sankar: Tim, it does on -- can the Apple Intelligence actually help the Services growth rate?\nTim Cook: Keep in mind that we were have released a lot of APIs and developers will be taking advantage of those APIs. That release has occurred as well and of course more are coming. And so I, definitely believe that a lot of developers will be taking advantage of Apple Intelligence in a big way. And what that does to Services, I'll not forecast, but I would say that from an ecosystem point of view, I think it will be great for the user and the user experience.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Krish. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. And Luca, congrats on the new role and pleasure working with you these years. I guess, if I could, for my first one, start with mix on the iPhone side? And what I'm really curious about if you have any thoughts given that Apple Intelligence is now going to be a consistent feature set across all the four sort of iPhones on the iPhone 16 series that you launched and going back to iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. Are you seeing any change in behavior from a consumer perspective in terms of which sort of on the mix front within the iPhone series where consumer adoption is given that there's more consistency of the features when it comes to Apple Intelligence across the board? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: It's tough to answer your question, because we've been constrained in October on the Pro and the Pro Max. And so, it's really too early in the curve to call the precise mix on the consumer versus the Pro. So, we'll see.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. And for my follow-up, Tim, during the quarter I think over the last 90 days, we had the quotes come out in relation to the DOJ relative to the Google sort of revenue sharing agreement that you have with them. How do you sort of look at it going forward in terms of emphasizing the role that Apple has in that ecosystem with Safari and sort of the potential outcomes that you're looking at? Thank you.\nTim Cook: I don't want to speculate on that from a legal point of view. It's an ongoing case, and I will save that for another day.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you, Samik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. My first one, Tim, I'd like to ask about some of the components in Services where despite your installed base, some parts of the Apple One bundle, like Music and News and Arcade and Fitness, are not obviously the market-leading offerings. And maybe what might change that and what other services could you call out as growing faster, having wider -- widening addressable markets like we've seen in pay or advertising?\nTim Cook: The way that I view it is that we have lots of opportunity in all of those. And so, there's lots of customers to try to convince to take advantage of it, and we're going to continue investing in the Services and adding new features and -- whether it's News+ or Music or Arcade, that's what we're going to do. Keep in mind that for us, we're more focused on being best than being most. And so, in some cases, not in every case, some of the services that you -- the majority of the services that you mentioned are not cross platform. We make them for our customers only and so that in some cases changes the person who's going to sell the most perhaps, but that's -- our objective is to make the best.\nRichard Kramer: Okay, thanks. And then, Luca, one piece of unfinished business was your pledge to get to a net-neutral cash position. And over the last two years, you stayed around $50 billion of net cash. We've clearly seen instances in the past where elevated marketing spend or other programs brought increases in market share. I guess my question looking back on your tenure is, at your scale now of $57 billion of OpEx, do you still see incremental ways to put that cash to work in the business? Or will we just continue to see increased shareholder returns?\nLuca Maestri: Well, obviously, as you've seen, our OpEx has gone up over the years. We've also seen at the same time a significant expansion in gross margin, maybe to a level that I would have not expected a few years ago, but we've done a very good job on a number of fronts. And so, I would say we -- when we plan -- every time we plan for the upcoming year, we think about all the different areas where we can deploy our resources and we make them available to grow the business. I think we've done very well over the long term and -- but our fundamental philosophy is to look after the business first. And then, if we have excess cash, we will continue to return it to our shareholders and the plan has worked quite well so far.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. We'll take our last question, please, operator?\nOperator: Our last question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Thank you for squeezing me in. It seems to us that the spec differentiation between iPhone 16 Pro and base model isn't as big as prior years. All iPhones have new A18, A18 Pro chips and there wasn't an increase in ASPs versus last year. Can you share with us if there is a shift in your strategy in terms of...\nOperator: Unfortunately, Mr. Malik's line has dropped.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Sorry, Atif. We'll connect offline. Thank you, everybody. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts as a webcast on apple.com/investor and via telephone.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook : Thank you Suhasini. Good afternoon everyone and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And we set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud compute, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13 and 15 inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020, is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 and 13 inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And With the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and Musicians can take advantage of the cutting edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered by the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieve revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins to-date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs our best ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie task to a user's voice. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third-parties from tracking you across the internet or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri : Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74% down 60 basis points from last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion, diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year, but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate a customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth of our installed base of active devices, sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reach a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses, leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Maybe Tim, if we start with you, you know, I thought some of the color you provided before the call about iPhone 15 performing better than the iPhone 14 was interesting. So just with that context, can you maybe help us understand where you see iPhone replacement cycles today, where you think the size of the base of iPhones that are aged and likely to upgrade are, and what that translates to in potential pent-up demand, as we enter a new iPhone cycle. And I have a follow-up, thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, hi Eric. The installed base hit an all-time high during the quarter and so we were very happy about that. iPhone in general grew in constant currency. And the 15, as you point out, if you look at the same number of weeks of the 15 from launch and compare that to the 14, the 15 is doing better than the 14. And so that's kind of a state of where we currently are. In terms of upgrade rates, it's very difficult mid-cycle to call upgrade rates. I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited about the level of value that we're going to provide to users. And we believe that -- that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade.\nErik Woodring: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, Tim. And then second, can you maybe dig into the China dynamics a bit? Sales down 6% this quarter, 3% in constant currency, an improvement from last quarter on a tougher compare that came on the back of some iPhone discounting. So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yeah, Erik, as you point out, we decreased by 6.5% year-over-year for the whole of Greater China. And if you look at it on a constant currency basis, we declined by less than 3%. So over 50% of the decline year-over-year is currency related. That is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and so we're happy to see the acceleration. If you look at iPhone in particular for Greater China, the installed base set a record. We also in Mainland China set a June quarter record for upgraders and so that's a very strong signal and in fact from Kantar -- the survey from Kantar this quarter showed that iPhones were the top three models in urban China. Also, if you look at -- one of the things we look at is the 15 family compared to the 14 family for the same number of weeks from launch. So this goes all the way back to the September of 2023. If you look at that, the 15 is outperforming the 14. And so those are some of the color I would provide. In addition, one of the things that we're very focused on is the level of new customers buying our products. And so if you look at this on the Mac and iPad, in Mainland China, the majority of customers buying or buying for the first time, buying that product for the first time and the watch, the vast, vast majority of people are buying a product for the first time. And during the quarter, I should say also that iPad returned to growth in Greater China, as it did around the world. And so we continue to be confident in the long-term opportunity in China. I don't know how every chapter of the book reads, but we're very confident in the long-term.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yeah.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Erik. Operator, may we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Hey, Tim, you know, now that you've launched or announced Apple intelligence, do you have any ideas on how it may impact services. Would it \u2013 do you feel like it'll accelerate your Services business augmented? And maybe folks will need to buy more storage and some other things. How are you thinking about it as a catalyst for Services into next year? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nTim Cook: We started the rollout of Apple Intelligence this week with developers, so some of the features are out there as of Monday. And we couldn't be more excited about getting them out there. Obviously, this will enable developers to take their apps to the next level. And so we are taking the first step in getting the beta out there, and we can't wait to see what kind of amazing things they do with it.\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks. And then Luca, with regard to gross margin, it's been -- there's been some component price inflation and mix. Do you mind just giving us a little more color on how you are managing that sequentially and how you feel about the current component environment as an impact on margins? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Sure, Ben. I think I'll give you a bit of the walk for the June quarter and then get into the outlook that we provided for the September quarter. At the total company level, we've reported 46.3%. It is down 30 basis points sequentially, and it was really driven by a different mix. Within products, of course, we launched very important products like the iPad during the course of the quarter. But we had an offset from a shift in mix towards Services, and we got some good cost savings. And so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, we are up significantly on the margin front. And keep in mind that foreign exchange continues to be a bit of a headwind for us. As we go into the September quarter, we are guiding 45.5% to 46.5%, which is kind of within the guidance that we provided last quarter. Again similar dynamics, we expect a slightly different mix. We expect foreign exchange to have a minimal impact sequentially, although a more significant impact on a year-over-year basis. On the commodity side, I think that is what you are referring to, yes we have seen some increases on the memory front, but the rest of the commodities, we see a continuous decline. So in general, we feel -- we're well positioned. And as you know well, these are very high levels of gross margin for us and we are pleased where we are.\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Ben. Operator may we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMike Ng: Hi, good afternoon. I just have two questions. First, I was wondering if you could talk about whether or not you've seen a shift in demand for iPhone 15 Pro, Pro Max models since WWDC that could potentially foreshadow consumer demand for Apple Intelligence enabled phones?\nTim Cook: We just announced the sort of the requirements at the system and the silicon level in June. And so we had very limited time during the quarter. So it's really too early to tell.\nMike Ng: That's fair. And then with the focus on upgrader potential over the next several years, I was just wondering if you could talk about what you are expecting from the US promotional environment from your channel partners, whether that's US wireless carriers, given the importance of device sales for those partners during an upgrade cycle. Or any retail support on what could be a very strong smartphone upgrade period? Thank you.\nTim Cook: We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and what it brings, and it is another compelling reason for an upgrade. I'd leave the promotional question for the sort of the carriers themselves to answer. But I believe it will be a very key time for -- and a compelling upgrade cycle.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon everyone. And I have two as well. I guess, Tim, maybe back to the Apple Intelligence dynamic. There's clearly a lot of excitement from consumers around what Apple Intelligence could mean for them. Can you just touch on your -- do you think the intent is to launch all the Apple Intelligence features at the same time to consumers, or do you think they end up getting staggered a bit? And if they are staggered, do you think it impacts how consumers come out and buy the next-generation iPhone?\nTim Cook: The rollout, as we mentioned in June, sort of -- we've actually started with developers this week. We started with some features of Apple Intelligence, not the complete suite. There are other features like languages beyond US English that will happen over the course of the year, and there are other features that will happen over the course of the year. And ChatGPT is integrated by the end of the calendar year. And so yes, so it\u2019s a staggered launch.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess your Services growth rates have been extremely impressive for several quarters and it seems like it is accelerated recently. Can you just touch -- talk about when you look at this double-digit growth, how much of that do you think is coming from the installed base growth versus better ARPU or better monetization of the installed base? And how do you kind of see that mix changing as you go forward?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit, it is Luca. It's a combination of a number of factors. The installed base growth is very important of course, because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our Services. We are seeing and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now. We see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people using the ecosystem both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters. Now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they are growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services, fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we are doing also a very good job at improving the quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We are very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because, particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Amit. Operator we will take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Tim, you announced Apple Intelligence, but you also announced partnerships with OpenAI and presumably more coming down the road. How should investors think about the monetization models around these partnerships where the CapEx investments are clearly being made by these potential partners. But you're obviously -- they're leveraging your distribution to your very attractive installed base. So in the long-term, do you see the Apple Intelligence part -- the Services growth from Apple Intelligence being the larger contributor over time? Or do you see these partnerships becoming a larger contributor over time? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: I think the way that I look at it is that Apple Intelligence is the on-device processing and the Private Cloud Compute. And a lot of that will be things with a personal context. And then for world knowledge, we are integrating with ChatGPT initially, and that will be focused on world knowledge as I said. And so the monetization model, I don't want to get into the terms of the commercial agreements because they are confidential between the parties. But I see both aspects as being very important. People want both.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks. As a follow-up maybe for Luca. Just stepping back to the gross margin discussion again. If I look at calendar 2023, you had on average 150 basis points increase in product gross margins on a year-on-year basis. In 2024 so far, it had been more flat year-on-year. When we think about that, is the incremental headwind, I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years. So ex-FX, are there other incremental headwinds that are either temporary or structural in nature that are perhaps limiting further upside to what are obviously very strong gross margins? Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. Of course, as you said, the foreign exchange continues to be -- this is incremental on a year-over-year basis. And it is one of those things that is outside of our control. We try to hedge our exposures. But it is what it is. We know that when the dollar is strong, our gross margins are affected. The other element that I think it's always important to keep in mind is that within the Products business, our products have different margin profiles. And depending on the relative success in the marketplace, our products' gross margin tends to move. And so the mix of our products has an impact on gross margins, right? And so we need to pay attention to that. Of course, we just launched an iPad and that is one of the factors. But we want all our products to be very successful in the marketplace. And that's why we always look at gross margin dollars as the first order of priority, and gross margin percentage tends to follow from that. The other factor that obviously has an impact, a significant impact is the state of the commodity markets, and they tend to go in cycles. And so we will see how that plays out over time. But in general, we feel good about the level of gross margins that we have for our products business, and we think we are in a good position there.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks Wamsi. Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the strong results. The first one for Luca or Tim. We keep hearing about these increasing silicon content for AI edge devices. And also, I think, Luca you spoke about increasing commodity costs. So I'm curious how to think about margins for these new AI devices. And Tim, do any of these Apple Intelligence features need more hardware updates than what we have today? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nTim Cook: Maybe I'll take the second one first and then pass it over to Luca. In terms of the requirements to run Apple Intelligence, there are system requirements and there are silicon requirements. And so from an iPhone point of view, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max will run Apple Intelligence and the successor products obviously. If you look at the Mac, it starts with the M series of silicon that started in 2020. And the iPad is the same, and so it starts with the M series of silicon. And so there are system requirements and silicon requirements that go with each of those.\nLuca Maestri: And from a gross margin standpoint, as you know, we don't provide any color past the current quarter, and we just provided guidance for the quarter 45.5% to 46.5%. It is essentially broadly in line with what we reported for the June quarter. So we'll take it quarter by quarter and we will report as the time goes by.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for Tim. Thanks for the color on China. We also see many other consumer discretionary and luxury brands talk about a weak China. And I think Tim, you said half the details was FX related. I'm curious, the other half of the weakness, was that more China macro related or do you think it is kind of like specific to Apple with domestic competitors? Any other color you could give would be very helpful. Thank you very much.\nTim Cook: Well, certainly, the competitive environment there is the most competitive in the world. I've said that before and that remains to be the case. The macroeconomic factors have been in the press too, and I'm not an expert on those. I can only tell you what we're seeing. And we were pleased that the business showed improvement from the first half of the year.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Krish. Operator, can we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Two, if I may also. Tim, first one for you. I know it is early days, and you talked about the developers just getting their hands on Apple Intelligence. But when you think about the categories that are currently in the App Store and kind of what you think app developers could do with this new technology, what's your instinct say in terms of -- are these going to be iterative applications to currently available applications? Is there any sort of category that you think lends itself more naturally to Apple Intelligence? Is it games? Is it more creative? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're thinking about it. And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\nTim Cook: If you look at how we've deployed Apple Intelligence or are deploying Apple Intelligence, we've really thought about it at pretty much all of the apps that you use every day. And so we've thought about it from Notes to Mail to Messages and all the rest. And so there is been a deep level of thinking about how it affects those apps. And that's going to surface Apple Intelligence in a way that is natural to the user, in a way that will I think, get them very excited about it and get usage. Similarly, I think the developers will do that on a broad basis with their apps as well. And so I think, it is profound and we'll see what the developers do. But we're very excited to get the initial seed out there this week and see what they do. I think it will be amazing, yes.\nDavid Vogt: Yes. No, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And Luca, just maybe -- I know you didn't give a full rundown of product categories in your prepared remarks. But if I kind of take your comments at face value, I guess what I'm trying to think about is for the next quarter, it sounds like with Services being relatively strong and FX easing a little bit. You are effectively saying that product revenue in the September quarter is going to basically be flat with the September quarter last year ahead of a product launch. And so I'm just trying to get a sense for, what are the puts and takes in that sort of outlook particularly as you have Apple Intelligence hopefully stoking the fire for demand going forward? Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: Well, we have provided -- let me repeat what we provided. We think that we are going to be growing total company revenue at a rate that is similar to what we reported, so the plus 5%, right? In spite of the fact that we are going to have some foreign exchange headwinds, and we said about 150 basis points in the December quarter. And we said that we will grow Services double digits at a rate that is similar to what we've reported for the first three quarters of the fiscal year. We are not going into the other categories. I think there is a lot of good math that you can do from what we've given you here. Keep in mind on the Mac that we will have a challenging compare from a year ago, given the fact that we launched and we had the full quarter impact of the launch of the MacBook Air 15-inch a year ago. And also on the iPad, we reported 24% growth in the June quarter. Clearly we had the benefit from the launch in the June quarter of the new products, the iPad Air and the iPad Pro. So important to keep that in mind on a sequential basis.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you David. Operator may we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first one is for Tim. I know it's early days. The feedback on Apple Intelligence software features like notification summary and reduced interruption focus from the developers who have tried the iOS 18.1 beta version this week is very positive. My question is in response to an earlier question, you talked about a staggered launch on some of these software features. So are you expecting most of the features that you announced at WWDC to be part of iOS 18? Or we should be thinking that some of these features could potentially be part of iOS 19 next year?\nTim Cook: Our objective that we said in June is to roll out US English starting in the fall and that is to users, and then proceed with more functionality, more features, if you will, and more languages and regions coverage as we proceed across the next year. And so we sort of gave a time frame that -- and we're tracking to that.\nAtif Malik: Understand. And the next one for Luca. Luca the Services growth momentum seems very strong. Are you seeing any impact from changes made to comply with the DMA rules?\nLuca Maestri: Well, as you know we have introduced some changes to the way we run the App Store in Europe already in March. And we are seeing a good level of adoption from developers on those changes. We are on an ongoing basis, discussing with the European Commission how to ensure full compliance with the DMA. It is obviously early stage, but in general, our results for the Services business and for the App Store have been pretty good until now. Again to just provide you a frame of reference, the percentage of revenue that we generate from the European Union on the App Store is about 7% of the total.\nAtif Malik: Very helpful. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli : Thank you Atif. Operator may we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Tim, if I can just ask you about Apple Intelligence as well. There is a regulatory aspect as well in certain geographies. You mentioned the staggered launch that you are aiming for and the timelines you're thinking. How are you thinking about the complexity of the regulatory process, in particular like EU and maybe China? And does -- in terms of your timelines of the rollout, are you sort of embedding in the regulatory aspect here? And how should we think about timing then including that? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nTim Cook: We are engaged as you would guess, with both regulatory bodies that you mentioned. And our objective is to move as fast as we can, obviously because our objective is always to get features out there for everyone. We have to understand the regulatory requirements before we can commit to doing that and commit a schedule to doing that. But we're very constructively engaged with both.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. And a quick one on the Wearables category, Luca. I know you mentioned the acceleration there on a sequential basis. Maybe you can just sort of parse that out in terms of what -- which categories drove the acceleration because that's been a category that has been lagging a bit in terms of revenue trends for the past couple of quarters. So just curious what is starting to sort of drive it to accelerate on a sequential basis? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes, I'll take that one. I think the important thing to remember when you look at the Wearables, Home and Accessories categories is that we have a difficult launch compare. And we've been running that for a few quarters and we still have that because last year had the continued benefit from the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the very first Watch Ultra. And so it is important to keep that in mind. If you sort of take a step back, however and look at the business across the trailing 12 months, it is grown -- the Wearables, Home and Accessories business has grown to almost $40 billion, which is double what it was five years ago.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you Samik. Operator, may we have the last question please.\nOperator: Our last question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks. Thanks very much. Tim, you referenced the investment in innovation, and your R&D sales ratio reached what I think was a June quarter record even before launching Apple Intelligence. Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the Services usage as they roll out, given that they are so new for consumers? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Clearly, we have increased R&D over time. We have been investing in AI and ML for years. And in addition to investing more, we've also redeployed certain skills onto AI and ML. And so the growth in sort of embedded in our numbers that we've shared here, it is increasing year-over-year. On the CapEx part, it is important to remember that we employ a hybrid kind of approach, where we do things internally and we have certain partners that we do business with externally where the CapEx would appear in their respective businesses. But yes, I mean you can expect that there is -- we will continue to invest and increase it year-on-year.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up for Luca. When we look at the free cash flow margins for the first nine months, they are up materially. And given this year's product mix, can you describe to us what exactly in the Services mix or cost control is driving what seems to be structurally higher free cash flow margins across the business?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, I'm glad you noticed that. We are pretty pleased with that fact. And I think you probably also noticed that we've increased our return of capital to shareholders this quarter. This one was a record quarter for us. Well, it's a combination of a number of things. Of course, an improvement in the top-line helps the margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay, as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Thanks.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

We do appreciate your participation."}, {"symbol": "AAPL", "quarter": 2, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-05-02 17:00:00", "content": "Suhasini Chandramouli: Good Afternoon, and welcome to the Apple Q2 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Today's call is being recorded. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions. These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin-America and the Middle East, as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential. In services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year-ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. We estimate this one-time impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described. Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They describe the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes and they share their amazement and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room. It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market. For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before, and this is just the beginning. Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in-store. We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in Generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create. As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do. Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year. We faced a difficult compare over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier. However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets, including Mainland China, and according to Kantar during the quarter, the two best-selling smartphones in Urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone. And just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future. Turning to Mac. March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and it\u2019s even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it. In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year, due to a difficult compare with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th Generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and performance. For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year-ago due to a difficult launch compare on Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10, and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day. Across our watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine-learning to power lifesaving features like a regular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need. As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments. Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ Originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins. Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers. Turning to retail, our stores continued to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold. And across the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time. Everywhere we operate and everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and lead the world better than we found it, whether we're making Apple podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing. Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal of being carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet. Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same time period. And we're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before. Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with a new M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S. and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices. And we're working with partners in India and the U.S. to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next two decades. Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects. And last month, we welcomed two supplier partners as new investors, who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund. Whether we're enriching lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. And I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. And thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix to services, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion, diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year, due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier. Adjusting for this one-time impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. And during the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan. And the iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air, powered by the M3 chip. Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac. Also customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S. iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging compare against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation from last year. At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. In addition, the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the US. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch compare. Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high and customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S. In services, as I mentioned, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year with our installed-base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business as we continued to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. And paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over $1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. We continued to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay. Turning to enterprise, our customers continued to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the Mac. In Healthcare, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for healthcare organizations like Emory Health to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use. And since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing at Porsche to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise. Taking a quick step back, when we look at our performance during the first-half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds. We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets, as we set first-half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin-America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey. These results, coupled with double-digit growth in services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open-market repurchases of $130 million Apple's shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash-neutral over time. We are also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continued to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024 to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low-single-digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points. We expect our services business to grow double-digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first-half of the fiscal year. And we expect iPad revenue to grow double-digits. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% to -- and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please?\nOperator: Certainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I have two, first, I'll ask about the June quarter guidance. The revenue outlook for low-single digits growth, I was wondering if you could run through some of the product assumptions, iPhone, like what kind of gives you confidence around that? And then on the service momentum, what was better than expected in the quarter? And then I just have a quick follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Hey, Mike. It's Luca. On the outlook, what we said is we expect to grow low-single-digits in total for the company. We expect services to grow double-digits at a rate that is similar to what we've done in the first-half of our fiscal year. And we've also mentioned that iPad should grow double-digits. This is the color that we're providing for the June quarter. In services, we've seen a very strong performance across the board. We've mentioned, we've had records in several categories, in several geographic segments. It's very broad based, our subscription business is going well. Transacting accounts and paid accounts are growing double-digits. And also we've seen a really strong performance both in developed and emerging markets. So very pleased with the way the services business is going.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you. And I wanted to ask about, as Apple leans more into AI and Generative AI, should we expect any changes to the historical CapEx cadence that we've seen in the last few years of about $10 billion to $11 billion per year or any changes to, you know, how we may have historically thought about the split between tooling, data center and facilities? Thank you very much.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. We are obviously very excited about the opportunity with Gen AI. We obviously are pushing very hard on innovation on every front and we've been doing that for many, many years. Just during the last five years, we spent more than a $100 billion in research and development. As you know, on the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners on the manufacturing side, we purchased some of the tools and manufacturing equipment. In some of the cases, our suppliers make the investment. On the -- and we do something similar on the data center side. We have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties. It's a model that has worked well for us historically and we plan to continue along the same lines going forward.\nMike Ng: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Awesome. Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Tim, can you talk about the implications to Apple from the changes driven by EU DMA? You've had to open up third-party app stores, clearly disposes some security risks on the one-hand, which can dilute the experience, but also lower payments from developers to Apple. What are you seeing developers choose in these early days and consumers choose in terms of these third-party app stores? And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: It's really too early to answer the question. We just implemented in March, as you probably know, in the European Union, the alternate app stores and alternate billing, et cetera. So we're focused on complying while mitigating the impacts to user privacy and security that you mentioned. And so that's our focus.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you, Tim. And Luca, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the product gross margins, the sequential step down. You noted both mix and leverage. Any more color on the mix, if you could share if customers are at all starting to mix down across product lines or is this more a mix across product lines? Just trying to get some color on customer behavior given some of the broader inflationary pressures. Thank you so much.\nLuca Maestri: On a sequential basis, yes, we were down. It's primarily the fact that we had a slightly different mix of products than the previous one. Obviously, leverage plays a big role as we move from the holiday quarter into the -- into, you know, a more typical quarter. So I would say primarily leverage in a different mix of products. I mean, we haven't seen anything different in terms within the product categories, we haven't seen anything particular.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you so much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Wamsi. We'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Maybe my first one, Tim, you've obviously mentioned your excitement around Generative AI multiple times. I'm just curious how Apple is thinking about the different ways in which you can monetize this technology because historically software upgrades haven't been a big factor in driving product cycles. And so could AI be potentially different? And how could that impact replacement cycles? Is there any services angle you'd be thinking? Any early color that you can share on that? And then I have a follow up, please. Thanks.\nTim Cook: I don't want to get in front of our announcements, obviously. I would just say that we see Generative AI as a very key opportunity across our products. And we believe that we have advantages that set us apart there. And we'll be talking more about it in as we go through the weeks ahead.\nErik Woodring: Okay. Very fair. Thank you. And then Luca, maybe to just follow up on Wamsi's comments or question. There's a broad concern about the headwind that rising commodity costs have on your product gross margins. Wondering if you could just clarify for us if we take a step back and look at all of the components and commodities that go into your products kind of collectively, are we -- are you seeing these costs rising? Are they falling? What tools do you have to try to help and mitigate some rising costs if at all, rising input costs if at all? Thank you so much.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. I mean during the last quarter, commodity costs, and in general, component costs have behaved favorably to us. On the memory front, prices are starting to go up. They've gone up slightly during the March quarter. But in general, I think it's been a period not only this quarter, but the last several quarters where, you know, commodities have behaved well for us. Commodities going cycles and so there's obviously always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. And so we're starting from a good point. As you know, we try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us. And so we will try to mitigate if there are headwinds. But in general, we feel particularly for this cycle, we are in good shape.\nErik Woodring: Thank you so much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Great. Thank you, Erik. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks for the question. And hey, Tim, I was wondering if I could ask the China question again. Is there any more color from your visit there that gives you confidence that you've reached a bottom there and that it's turning? And I know you've been -- you've continued to be confident there in the long-term. Just wondering if there was any color as to when you think that the tide turns there? Thanks a lot. And I have a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Yes, Ben, if you look at our results in Q2 for Greater China, we were down 8%. That's an acceleration from the previous quarter in Q1. And the primary driver of the acceleration was iPhone. And if you then look at iPhone within Mainland China, we grew on a reported basis. That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier. And if you look at the top-selling smartphones, the Top 2 in Urban China are iPhones. And while I was there, it was a great visit and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic, and so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. And so I maintain a great view of China in the long-term. I don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week. But over the long haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.\nBen Reitzes: Okay. Hey, thanks, Tim. And then my follow-up, I want to ask this carefully though. It's a -- there's a fear out there that, you may lose some traffic acquisition revenue. And I was wondering if you thought AI from big picture and it doesn't have to be on a long-term basis, I mean from a big picture, if AI is an opportunity for you to continue to monetize your mobile real estate, just how you -- how maybe investors can think about that from a big picture, just given that's been one of the concerns that's potentially been an overhang, of course, due to, you know, a lot of the news and the media around some of the legal cases? And I was wondering if there's just a big-picture color you could give that makes us kind of think about it better and your ability to sort of continue to monetize that real estate? Thanks a lot.\nTim Cook: I think AI, Generative AI and AI, both are big opportunities for us across our products. And we'll talk more about it in the coming weeks. I think there are numerous ways there that are great for us. And we think that we're well-positioned.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Ben. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Again, sorry to beat the AI haul. But Tim, I know you don't want to like reveal a lot. But I'm just kind of curious, because last quarter you spoke about how you're getting traction in enterprise. Is the AI strategy going to be both consumer and enterprise or is it going to be one after the other? Any color would be helpful? And then, I have a follow-up for Luca.\nTim Cook: Our focus on enterprise has been and you know through the quarter and the quarters that preceded it on selling iPhones and iPads and Macs and we recently added Vision Pro to that. And we're thrilled with what we see there in terms of interest from big companies buying some to explore ways they can use it. And so I see enormous opportunity in the enterprise. I wouldn't want to cabin that to AI only. I think there's a great opportunity for us around the world in the enterprise.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then for Luca, you know, I'm kind of curious on -- given the macro-environment, on the hardware side, are you seeing a bias towards like standard iPhone versus the Pro model? The reason I'm asking the question is that there's a weaker consumer spending environment, yet your services business is still growing and has amazing gross margins. So I'm just trying to like square the circle over there. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: I'm not sure I fully understand the question, but in general, what we are seeing on the product side, we continued to see a lot of interest at the top of the range of our products. And I think it's a combination of consumers wanting to purchase the best product that we offer in the different categories and our ability to make those purchases more affordable over time. We've introduced several financing solutions from installment plans to trading programs that reduce the affordability threshold and therefore, customers tend to buy -- want to buy at the top of the range that is very valuable for us in developed markets, but particularly in emerging markets where the affordability issues are more pronounced. But in general, over the last several years and that is also reflected in our gross margins, over the last several years, we've seen this trend, which we think is pretty sustainable.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thank you very much, Luca, and thanks, Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. You know, I guess, first off on capital allocation, you folks have about $58 billion of net cash right now. As you think about eventually getting to this net cash-neutral target, do you think at some point, Apple would be open to taking on leverage on the balance sheet and continuing the buyback program? Or is it more like once you get to this neutral position, it's going to be about returning free cash flow back to shareholders? I'm just wondering, how do you think about leverage on your balance sheet over time and what sort of leverage do you think you'd be comfortable taking on?\nLuca Maestri: Hey, Amit. This is Luca. I would say one step at a time, we have put out this target of getting to net cash-neutral several years ago and we're working very hard to get there. Our free cash flow generation has been very strong over the years, particularly in the last few years. And so as you've seen this year, we've increased the amount that we're allocating to the buyback. For the last couple of years, we were doing $90 billion, now we're doing $110 billion. So let's get there first. It's going to take a while still. And then when we are there, we're going to reassess and see what is the optimal capital structure for the company at that point in time. Obviously, there's going to be a number of considerations that we will need to look at when we get there.\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. I figure it's worth trying anyway. If I go back to this China discussion a bit and, you know, Tim, I think your comments around growth in iPhones in Mainland China is really notable. Could you step back, I mean, these numbers are still declining at least Greater China on a year-over-year basis in aggregate. Maybe just talk about what are you seeing from a macro basis in China and then at least annual decline -- or year-over-year declines that we're seeing. Do you think it's more macro driven or more competitive driven over there? That would be helpful.\nTim Cook: Yes, I can only tell you what we're seeing. And so I don't want to present myself as a economist. So I'll steer clear of that. From what we saw was an acceleration from Q1, and it was driven by iPhone and iPhone in Mainland China before we adjust for this $5 billion impact that we talked about earlier did grow. That means the other products didn't fare as well. And so we clearly have work there to do. I think it has been and is through last quarter, the most competitive market in the world. And I -- so I, you know, wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before, and I believe that it was last quarter as well. And -- but if you step back from the 90-day cycle, what I see is a lot of people moving into the middle class, a -- we try to serve customers very well there and have a lot of happy customers and you can kind of see that in the latest store opening over there. And so I continue to feel very optimistic.\nAmit Daryanani: Great. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Amit. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. I'm going to roll the two together, so you guys have them both. So Luca obviously, I'm trying to parse through the outlook for the June quarter. And just based on the quick math, it looks like all things being equal, given what you said, the iPhone business is going to be down mid-single-digits again in the June quarter. And if that's the case and maybe this is for Tim obviously, how are you thinking about the competitive landscape in the context of what you just said maybe outside of China and what changes sort of, the consumer demand or receptivity to new devices because we've been in this malaise for a while. Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing? And do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward? Or is it just really more of a timing issue in terms of the replacement cycle is a little bit long in the tooth, and we see a bit of an upgrade cycle at some point, maybe later this year into next year? Thanks.\nTim Cook: I do see a key opportunity, as I've mentioned before with Generative AI with all of our devices or the vast majority of our devices. And so I think that if you look out that that's not within the next quarter or so and we don't guide at the product level, but I'm extremely optimistic. And so that -- that's kind of how I view it. In terms of the -- I'll let Luca comment on the outlook portion of it. I think if you step back on iPhone though and you make this adjustment from the previous year, our Q2 results would be flattish on iPhone. And so that's how we performed in Q2.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, David, on the outlook, I'll only repeat what we said before, and this is the color that we're providing for the quarter. We do expect to grow in total, low-single-digits. And we do expect services to grow double-digits, and we expect iPad to grow double-digits for the rest. I'll let you make assumptions and then we will report three months from now.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys. I'll get back in the queue.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, David. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question, and I have a couple as well. Maybe for the first one, your services growth accelerated from 11% growth to 14%. If you can sort of dig into the drivers of where or which parts of services did you really see that acceleration? And why it isn't a bit more sustainable as we think about the next quarter? Because I believe you're guiding more to sort of averaging out the first half of the year for the next quarter. So just curious what were the drivers and why not have it a bit more sustainably sort of improve as we go through the remainder of the year? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: So a number of things on services. First of all, the overall performance was very strong. As I said earlier, all-time records in both developed and emerging markets. So we see our services do well across the world. Records in many of our services categories. There are some categories that are growing very fast also because they are relatively smaller in the scheme of our services business like cloud, video, payment services. You know, those all set all-time revenue records. And so we feel very good about the progress that we're making in services. As we go forward, I'll just point out that if you look at our growth rates a year ago, they improved during the course of the fiscal year last year. So the comps for the services business become a bit more challenging as we go through the year. But in general, as I mentioned, we still expect to grow double-digits in the June quarter at a rate that is very similar to what we've done in the first half.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Got it. And for my follow up, if I can ask you more specifically about the India market. Obviously, you continue to make new records in terms of revenue in that market. How much of the momentum you're seeing would you associate with your sort of retail strategy in that market, retail expansion relative to maybe some of the supply change or the sort of manufacturing changes or strategy you've undergone or taken in that market itself. Any thoughts around that would be helpful?\nTim Cook: Sure. We did grow strong double-digit. And so we were very, very pleased about it. It was a new March quarter revenue record for us. As you know, as I've said before, I see it as an incredibly exciting market and it's a major focus for us. In terms of the operational side or supply chain side, we are producing there, from a pragmatic point of view, you need to produce there to be competitive. And so yes, there the two things are linked from that point of view. But we have both operational things going on and we have go-to-market, and initiatives going on. We just opened a couple of stores as last year, as you know, and we see enormous opportunity there. We're continuing to expand our channels, and also working on the developer ecosystem as well. And we've been very pleased that there is a rapidly-growing base of developers there. And so, we're working all of the entire ecosystem from developer to the market to operations, the whole thing. And I just -- I could not be more excited and enthusiastic about it.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for that.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Samik. Operator, we'll have the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the questions, and I think I have to have two as well like everybody else. I guess, I'm going to go back to the China question. I guess, at a high level, the simple question is, when we look at the data points that have been repeatedly reported throughout the course of this quarter, I'm curious, Tim, you know, what are we missing? Like where do you think people are missing, Apple's iPhone traction within the China market, just at a high level, you know, given the data points that were reported throughout this course of the last quarter?\nTim Cook: I can't address the data points. I can only address what our results are. And we did accelerate last quarter, and the iPhone grew in Mainland China. So that's what the results were. I can't bridge to numbers we didn't come up with.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, I know you guys haven't talked about this, you know, quantified it in quite some time. But I'm curious how we would characterize the channel inventory dynamics for iPhone?\nTim Cook: Sure. The -- for the March quarter, we decreased channel inventory during the quarter. We usually decreased channel inventory during the Q2 timeframe. So that's not unusual. And we're very comfortable with the overall channel inventory.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Aaron. Operator, we'll take the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Please go ahead.\nRichard Kramer: Thanks very much. I'm not going to ask about China, but you regularly call out all the rapid growth in many other emerging markets. So is Apple approaching a point where all of those other emerging markets in aggregate might crossover to become larger than your current $70 billion Greater China segments, and maybe investors could look at that for driving growth for the wider business? And then I have a follow-up for Luca. Thanks.\nLuca Maestri: I think, Richard, you're asking a really interesting question. We were looking at something similar recently. Obviously, China is by far the largest emerging market that we have. But when we started looking at places like India, like Saudi, like Mexico, Turkey, of course, Brazil and Mexico and Indonesia, the numbers are getting large, and we're very happy because these are markets where our market share is low, the populations are large and growing. And our products are really making a lot of progress with the -- in those markets. The level of excitement for the brand is very high. Tim was in Southeast Asia recently, and the level of excitement is incredibly high. So it is very good for us. And then -- and certainly, the numbers are getting larger all the time. And so the gap as you compare it to the numbers in China is reducing, and hopefully, that trajectory continues for a long time.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. And then as a follow-up, maybe for either of you, I mean, you're coming up on four years from what was incredibly popular iPhone 12 cycle. And, you know, given you're struggling to reduce your net -- your -- reach your net neutral cash position and your margins are sort of near highs, do you see ways to deploy capital more to spur replacement demand in your installed base either with greater device financing, more investment in marketing, more promotions. I mean, do you feel like you needed to produce those sort of margins or is it a more important to spur growth with replacement? Thanks.\nTim Cook: I think innovation spurs the upgrade cycle, and as one thing, of course, there's economic factors as well that play in there. And what kind of offerings there are from our carrier partners and so forth. And so there's a number of variables in there. But we work all of those, and you know, we price our products for the value that we're delivering. And so that's how we look at it.\nLuca Maestri: And if I can add to Tim's comments, Richard, one of the things that when you look over the long arc of time that maybe is not fully understood is that we've gone through a long period of very strong dollar. And what that means given that our company sells more than 60% of our revenue is outside the United States. The demand for our products in those markets is stronger than the results that we report just because of the translation of those local currencies into dollars, right? And so that is something to keep in mind as you look at our results, right? And so we are making all the investments that are needed and Tim has talked about innovation. Obviously, we made a lot of progress with financing solutions, with trading programs and so on, and we will continue to make all those investments.\nRichard Kramer: Okay. Super. Thanks, guys.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Richard. Operator, can we take our last question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions, and I have two questions as well. First for Tim, for enterprise, specifically, what are some of the top two or three use cases on Vision Pro you're hearing most excitement? And then I have a follow-up for Luca.\nTim Cook: Yes, the great thing is, I'm hearing about so many of them. I wouldn't say that one has emerged as the top, right now. The most impressive thing is that similar to the way people use a Mac, you use it for everything. People are using it for many different things in enterprise, and that varies from field service to training to healthcare related things like preparing a doctor for pre-op surgery or advanced imaging. And so the -- it commands control centers. And so it's an enormous number of different verticals. And you know our focus is on -- is growing that ecosystem and getting more apps and more and more enterprises engaged. And the event that we had recently, I can't overstate the enthusiasm in the room. It was extraordinary. And so we're off to a good start, I think, with the enterprise.\nAtif Malik: Great. And then Luca, I believe you mentioned that for the March quarter, the commodity pricing environment was favorable. Can you talk about what you're assuming for commodity pricing on memory and et cetera for the June quarter and maybe for the full-year?\nLuca Maestri: Yes, we provide guidance just for the current quarter. So I'll tell you about the, you know, the guidance. We're guiding to again to a very high level of gross margins, 45.5% to 46.5%. Within that guidance, we expect memory to be a slight headwind, not a very large one, but a slight headwind. And the same applies for foreign exchange. Foreign exchange will have a negative impact sequentially of about 30 basis points.\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Atif.

I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\nTim Cook: Thank you. Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year. And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year. Now, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SoS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact. Turning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game. A favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to-device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continue to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video, as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Usher. Turning to Retail. In recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity Collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do a central work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by core belief in the transformative power of innovation. And so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long-term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and return to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Mac\u2019s, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000 plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?\nOperator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Hey guys, good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. And congrats on the nice quarter here. Luca, maybe if we start with you. Can you unpackage some of the Services drivers a bit for us. Obviously, really nice outperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations. A record gross margin implies your higher margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about Services growth for the March quarter? And then, speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter and then in the March quarter, what the different puts and takes would be? And then, I have a follow-up please. Thank you.\nLuca Maestri: Thanks, Erik, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up 11%, $23.1 billion is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in The Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pac. So it was pretty broad-based geographically, and very strong across all the Services categories, because we had all-time revenue records for cloud, for payments, for video, and for advertising and December quarter records for the App Store and for AppleCare. Obviously, last year, we had an extra week, so the 11% is stronger than -- the underlying performance is stronger than the 11% that we have reported. I think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is obviously very important. And paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double-digits. Just as a reference, we have more than a billion paid subscriptions across all the services on our platform. This is more than double the number of paid subscriptions that we had only four years ago. So, obviously, very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double-digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter. We don't provide guidance around the different services categories. So, we will provide more color when we report in three months.\nErik Woodring: Okay. Thank you, Luca. And then, Tim, really nice to see your installed base reach a record high, again, against all products and geos. I'm wondering if you could share a bit more detail about the new users you were able to on-board over the last 12 months. Meaning, how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts, either in terms of geographic representation or SKU to certain products or even how their monetization trends might differ from past cohorts. And that's it from me. Thanks so much.\nTim Cook: Yes. Hi, Erik. I would say emerging markets are -- have been a very key area of strength for us. If you look at it, India grew -- in revenue terms grew strong double-digits in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets like Indonesia also hit a quarterly record. And we had several regions, with records from Latin America to the Middle East. And that theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters that -- of the year as well. And so, emerging markets, very, very important. And I feel like we are doing a great job there.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Erik. Operator, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. I just have two questions as well. First, on Services. Just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as of December quarter. I'm just wondering why not -- why won't it be potentially faster, given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra week comp, and I'd also think that some of the pricing uplifts on select Apple One services that were implemented last winter should help in the March quarter? Any additional thoughts there would be great in terms of what some of your assumptions are. And then, I have a quick follow-up.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. We'll see how the quarter develops. I would point to two things. One is the fact that we mentioned that we expect a couple of points of negative foreign exchange in the March quarter, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for us in the December quarter. So, you've got a bit of a headwind there. And then, when you look at our other progression of our Services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than the compares for December.\nMike Ng: Great. Thank you, Luca. And then, my second question. It was very interesting to hear about some of the enterprise customer investments into Vision Pro. Could you maybe just talk about some of the efforts to support Vision Pro developer ecosystem. And it was also good to hear about the potential upcoming announcements on AI. So any thoughts there would also be helpful. Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yeah. Hi. It's -- we are incredibly excited about the Enterprise opportunities with Vision Pro. I've seen several demos from different companies. Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing collaboration -- design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. Really all over the map, there are applications that are for control center, command center kind of things. SAP has really gotten behind it and, of course, SAP is in so many of companies. I think there will be a great opportunity for us in Enterprise, and we couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We are obviously looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple. And really, it took a whole of company effort to bring it to this far. In terms of generative AI, which, I'd guess, is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so, we're going to hold that to this as well. But we've got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.\nMike Ng: Wonderful. Thank you, Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I have two questions as well. First on iPhone. There have been concerns around replacement cycles lengthening, China competition intensifying, and you still beat iPhone revenues despite the weaker performance in China. Curious how you're thinking about the 15 cycle overall, given what you saw in the December quarter. And I've a follow-up.\nTim Cook: Hi, it's Tim. The -- we were up 6%, as we mentioned in the opening remarks. We are happy with that performance. Underneath there, we had really strong performance in several parts of the world with all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. As I mentioned earlier, we did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East. And we set December quarter records in India and Indonesia. And so, really some spectacular broad-based reactions to iPhone. We also importantly set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders. And the installed base hit a new all-time high consistent with the -- our overall devices. And so, there's lot of good things. Luca mentioned in his opening comments that iPhones were four out of the top five smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan and four out of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all top five in Australia, and the customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%. If you look at iPhone 15 since the announcement of it and shipment in September, so this is including some of Q4 and you compare that to iPhone 14 over the same period of time, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14. And so, we feel very good about that, and the upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.\nWamsi Mohan: Great. Thank you, Tim. And as a follow-up, obviously, you're just launching the Vision Pro and it's an entirely new category. It's a price point that's a much higher starting price point relative to most of your other, probably over the last decade, product introductions, but just wondering how would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time and which Apple products adoption curve would you look at as potentially the most similar? And is there a way in which we could think Vision Pro could eclipse maybe something like the iPad in revenue over time. Thank you.\nTim Cook: You know, each product has its own journey. And so, I wouldn't want to compare it to any one in particular. I would just say we couldn't be more excited. Internally, we've got an incredible amount of excitement from developers and from customers that can't wait till tomorrow to pick up their units. And we are incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the U.S. starting tomorrow for people that are -- that want to check it out. And so, we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5,000 patents in the product and it's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning. All the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. And so, we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in the store for tomorrow and see the reaction myself.\nWamsi Mohan: Thank you so much, Tim.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Wamsi. Operator, we'll take the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. I have two as well. I guess, first off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in China right now. I think from a geographic basis, one of the few places that was down double-digits, while everything else was growing. So, I'm hoping you spend a bit of time discussing what are you seeing there from a competitive perspective and more importantly, from a demand perspective in China?\nTim Cook: Yeah. If you look at iPhone in China Mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest, and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on iPhone. And so, it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year-over-year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year-over-year in Mainland China and we had four of the top six smartphone models in urban China. Also, IDC just put out a note, that you may have seen, that we were the top brand in -- for the full year and for the December quarter. And so, there's some good news along with \u2013 obviously, we'd prefer not to [contract] (ph).\nAmit Daryanani: Fair enough. And then, as a follow-up, you folks have implemented a fair bit of changes around the App Store in Europe post the DMA implementation there. Can you just touch on what are some of the key updates? And then, Luca, as a net of it all, do you see it having any significant impact financially to your services or a broader Apple P&L statement? Thank you.\nTim Cook: Yes. You know, the -- let me try to answer a little bit of both and then Luca can add some comments to it. We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March. So, the last month of the first calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Those are -- some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores, our marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps. And so, these are some of the things we announced. The -- if you think about what we've done over the years is, we've really majored on privacy, security, and usability. And we've tried our best to get as close to the past in terms of the things that are -- that people love about our ecosystem as we can, but we are going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply, because we need to comply with the regulation. And so, in terms of predicting the choices that developers and users will make, it's very difficult to do that with precision. And so, I will see what happens in March.\nLuca Maestri: Yes, Amit. As Tim said, these are changes that we're going to be implementing in March. A lot will depend on the choices that will be made. Just to keep it in context, the changes applied to the EU market, which represents roughly 7% of our global app store revenue.\nAmit Daryanani: Perfect. That's a really good perspective to have. Thank you very much.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Amit. Operator, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I have two as well as you would imagine. I guess, the first question I wanted to just ask maybe unpack a little bit more, just remarkable trends that we're seeing in your product gross margin specifically. So, I'm curious as we look forward, I guess on this last quarter, where there any kind of benefits you're seeing from like just the purchase component, obligations that you've put in place, let's say, a year ago, and that flowing through. And how are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking-forward?\nLuca Maestri: Yes. On the product side and then maybe I'll make a comment in total for the company. On the product side, our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points. So, obviously, a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models. And leverage, of course, it's the biggest quarter of the year for us and so we get the leverage effect. We had a partial offset, negative impact from foreign exchange. But net-net, obviously, very significant improvement. And we had very similar dynamics on the Services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also, in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so, the combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9% at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.\nAaron Rakers: Okay. And then, the second question I was just going to ask. Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out for me is that, your capital expenditures has actually come down this last year. I'm curious as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for generative AI, kind of platform as we move forward? Just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies.\nLuca Maestri: I'll take the question, Aaron. We've always said, we will never underinvest in the business. So, we are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, services development. And so, we will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level. And we're very excited about what's in store for us for the rest of the year.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thanks, Aaron. Operator, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one for Luca, a clarification on a question. The $5 billion impact in March quarter, is that for product revenue or is that total company revenue. And along the same part, you highlighted the strong gross margins. And I understand last year, some of the commodity costs were deflationary, buy looks like it\u2019s going to be inflationary right now. And also you've done some of the Mac conversions that -- the silicon conversions. So I'm just trying to figure out how much juice is there more to squeeze on the gross margin side? And then I'll follow up for Tim.\nLuca Maestri: Yes. The -- so the first part of the question was around -- oh, the $5 billion. The $5 billion, as I mentioned, a year ago we had this disruption of supply on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because of the factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 situation. And so, essentially there was pent up demand as we exited December quarter, they got fulfilled and we also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter. So close to $5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to iPhone. On the gross margin side, obviously, we are at very high levels of gross margin. And I'll repeat what I said before, we've had good expansion over the last few quarters and now we are guiding to 46% to 47% and that takes into account everything that is going on, which is, the commodity environment, which is the foreign exchange situation, and obviously the product and services mix. And the outcome of this is the guidance, which obviously is very strong and we're very happy with it.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks a lot, Luca. And then I have a follow-up for Tim. Tim, it was very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise. And historically, Apple has been a consumer centric company. And now with Vision Pro, Mac, it's sort of penetrating more into the enterprise. I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future? Would it still be consumer centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise focused also as we get into the future? Thank you very much.\nTim Cook: We've really concluded that we can do both. That if you look at it, what has happened over the last several years is that, employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them. And so, it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple, because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well. iPad has also benefited from that. Vision Pro, it's -- when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600 plus that are -- have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of Enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of Enterprise in a long time. And so, I think there's a like there is for the Mac and iPad, and of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone. I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.\nKrish Sankar: Great. Thanks a lot Tim. Very interesting to hear. Thank you.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Krish. Operator, can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks guys. And I have two questions as well. So, Tim and Luke, I appreciate the strength in the emerging markets like India and the other names that you kind of listed on the call, but can you maybe spend some time on the Americas? Obviously, that was relatively flat, you touched on China, but what are you seeing in that market from the carriers here in the States? And is the sales cycle elongating or the replacement cycle elongating? And in your view what has to change to kind of maybe re-accelerate that business in the America's, particular in the iPhone business? And then on sort of -- I just want to make sure I understand sort of the guide. So when I think about the $5 billion pull forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I back it out last quarter or I back it up this quarter, the March quarter, this would be sort of the softest quarter since the COVID pandemic. Obviously, I know the Americas as I just touched on is a little bit softer than China, which you cleared up earlier. But how do you think about the differences in sort of the macro conditions by region? And again, do you have a sense for are we nearing a trough from a macro demand perspective or how long do you think this particular weakness persists? Thanks.\nTim Cook: Let me take the first part of your question about America. If you look at the U.S., which obviously drives the vast, vast majority of the revenue in America, we grew in the December quarter from an iPhone business point of view and the install base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point. And so, what we focus on internally a lot is the active install base and the -- obviously, the sales over usually a cycle and we feel better about those things. If you look at the -- who's selling what in the U.S., the iPhone is four out of the top five selling smartphones in the US. And of course, the customer satisfaction in the U.S. as we alluded to earlier is 99%. So we feel very, very good about what our position is in the U.S.\nLuca Maestri: And I would add to that, keep in mind, obviously, the extra week that we had a year ago that obviously makes the compare more -- a bit distorted. On the March quarter guide, I would point to you that, obviously, the COVID years had a lot of, let's say, turmoil in it, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see. If you look at our sequential progression from December to March this year versus pre-COVID versus like a more normal environment, it's actually stronger than those years.\nDavid Vogt: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, David. Operator, can we have the last question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Yes. Hi. Thanks. Appreciate it. Two questions, if I can sneak them in. Just wanted to clarify on China. Tim, I think last quarter you still thought it was a growth market. Obviously, there's some concerns with the -- recently and given what we saw in the quarter, is there something that we can kind of point to where you feel that that market can resume growth in the future? And I'm wondering if you're still upbeat about that prospect. And then I just have a quick follow up.\nTim Cook: Ben, we've been in China for 30 years. And I remain very optimistic about China over the long term. And I feel good about hitting a new install base number, high watermark and very good about the growth in upgraders year-over-year during the quarter.\nBen Reitzes: Great. Thanks Tim. And just in terms of AI, I know you're not going to talk about your plans, but do you believe -- are you a believer in the edge thesis that AI and processing on smartphones and devices like yours is going to have a huge role in AI and AI apps and that it's something you guys can take advantage of.\nTim Cook: Let me just say that, I think there's a huge opportunity for Apple with GenAI and AI. And without getting into to more details and getting out in front of myself.\nBen Reitzes: Thanks Tim.\nTim Cook: Yes, Thanks, Ben.\nSuhasini Chandramouli: All right. Thank you Ben.
