Based on the earnings transcript, Apple Inc. reported strong sales for the March quarter, driven by robust iPhone and iPad sales, and achieved new records for iTunes sales. The company also announced a significant expansion of its capital return program, increasing it to $100 billion by the end of 2015. This move, along with the increased dividend and share repurchases, is expected to provide a boost to Apple's stock price. However, the company's guidance for the June quarter indicates a potential slowdown in revenue growth and gross margins, which may lead to some short-term volatility in the stock price. Overall, the earnings report suggests a positive outlook for Apple's future, driven by its strong ecosystem and innovative product pipeline.
