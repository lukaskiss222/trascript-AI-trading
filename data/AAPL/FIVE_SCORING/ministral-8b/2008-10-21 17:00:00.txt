The company also provided detailed non-GAAP financial measures to offer more transparency into its performance. Management highlighted the success of the iPhone 3G, which contributed significantly to the company's revenue and net income. The iPhone 3G's success led to Apple becoming the third-largest mobile phone supplier globally, measured by revenues. The company also discussed the App Store's success, with over 5,500 applications available and the 200 millionth application expected to be downloaded in the near future. Apple's retail stores also performed well, with record sales and a significant increase in the number of stores. The company's gross margin was better than expected, driven by higher-than-anticipated gross margin and lower costs associated with the iPod product transition. However, the company warned that the economic downturn could impact its business, but management remains confident in its product lineup and cash position. The company's guidance for the December quarter was also provided, with revenue expected to be between $9 billion and $10 billion, gross margin between 30% and 31%, and EPS between $1.06 and $1.35. Overall, the earnings call was positive, with strong results and a solid product lineup, but the economic uncertainty could impact the company's performance in the near term.
