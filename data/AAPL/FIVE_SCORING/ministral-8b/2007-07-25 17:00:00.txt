**Analysis:**

Apple reported strong Q2 results, with record Mac sales and iPhone sales exceeding expectations. The company's gross margin was higher than expected due to favorable commodity costs and a more favorable product mix. Management expressed confidence in the iPhone's long-term growth potential and reiterated their goal to sell 10 million iPhones in 2008. However, the company guided for lower gross margins in Q3 due to back-to-school promotions, higher commodity costs, and product transitions.

**Conclusion:**

The earnings report was positive, with strong sales and margin growth. However, the lower guidance for Q3 may cause some short-term pressure on the stock. The iPhone's long-term potential and the company's focus on non-iPod, non-Mac products could provide upside in the long run. Given the strong results and management's confidence in the iPhone's future, the short-term impact on the stock is likely to be positive.
