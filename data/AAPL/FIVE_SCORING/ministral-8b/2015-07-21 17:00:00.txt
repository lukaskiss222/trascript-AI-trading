Based on the earnings transcript, Apple Inc. reported strong financial results for the June 2015 quarter, with revenues of $49.6 billion and earnings of $10.7 billion. The company's year-over-year growth rate in the fiscal third quarter accelerated over the first half of fiscal 2015, with revenues up 33% and earnings per share up 45%. The iPhone unit sales grew 35%, which is almost three times the rate of growth of the smartphone market overall, and the company gained share in all geographic segments. The iPhone revenue grew even more strongly, up 59%. The company also reported strong results for Mac, App Store, and services revenue, with App Store revenue growing 24% and services revenue setting a new all-time record.

However, the company's guidance for the September quarter was lower than expected, with revenue expected to be between $49 billion and $51 billion compared to $42.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company also expects gross margin to be between 38.5% and 39.5%, which is lower than the 40.8% reported in the June quarter. The company's cash position also decreased by $9.3 billion to $202.8 billion, which was driven by a $10 billion issuance of term debt.

The company's management also addressed the impact of the strong US dollar on its international business, noting that the currency movement has reduced its growth rate and has had to reprice in some markets. However, the company reported that iPhone sales have been resilient in spite of the price increases.

Overall, the earnings report was generally positive, with the company reporting strong financial results and a more cautious outlook for the September quarter. The stock price may experience some short-term pressure due to the lower-than-expected guidance and the impact of the strong US dollar on the company's international business. However, the company's strong performance in the June quarter and its continued investment in new products and services suggest long-term potential.
