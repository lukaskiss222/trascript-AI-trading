**Analysis:**

Apple Inc.'s Q1 2019 earnings call revealed mixed results, with a 5% decrease in revenue compared to the previous year, primarily driven by weaker demand in Greater China and other emerging markets. The company's Services business grew by 19%, but this was partially offset by a 15% decline in iPhone revenue. Management attributed the iPhone slowdown to lower than expected upgrades, foreign exchange headwinds, and reduced carrier subsidies. Despite these challenges, Apple maintains a strong balance sheet and a robust pipeline of products and services. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:**

The stock will fall. [-2]
