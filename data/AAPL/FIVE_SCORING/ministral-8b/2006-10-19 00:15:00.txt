### Analysis:

Apple Inc.'s Q4 earnings call provided a mixed bag of news. The company reported strong revenue growth and impressive sales figures for both Macs and iPods. However, several factors suggest potential short-term headwinds. The lower ASPs and gross margins due to price reductions on new iPod models could impact earnings. Additionally, the delay in the shipment of the Shuffle and the potential slowdown in the Mac business ahead of the Leopard launch next year could pose risks. The company's guidance for the December quarter was slightly below expectations, which may lead to some short-term uncertainty in the stock price.

### Conclusion:

The earnings call highlighted both strong performance and potential risks. While the company's financial results were impressive, the lower ASPs and margins, along with the delayed Shuffle shipment and potential slowdown in the Mac business, suggest short-term challenges. This may lead to some short-term volatility in the stock price. However, the long-term growth prospects, driven by innovation and strong product pipelines, remain promising.
