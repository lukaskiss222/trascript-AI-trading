**Analysis:**

The Apple Inc. earnings call for Q3 Fiscal Year 2023 revealed a mixed bag of results. Revenue of $81.8 billion was down 1% year-over-year, primarily due to FX headwinds, but this was better than expectations. iPhone revenue was down 2% year-over-year but grew on a constant currency basis, driven by strong emerging markets and a June quarter record for switchers. Services revenue set an all-time record, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 8%. However, Mac and iPad revenue declined due to difficult compares against last year's shutdowns. The company maintained a strong gross margin of 44.5%, driven by favorable commodity prices and a mix shift towards Services. Management provided guidance for the September quarter, expecting similar revenue performance, FX headwinds, and double-digit declines for Mac and iPad. The company also announced a $24 billion shareholder return program.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on Apple Inc.'s stock is likely to be positive due to the company's strong performance in Services and emerging markets, as well as the guidance for the September quarter. The stock may experience some volatility due to the FX headwinds and the decline in Mac and iPad revenue. However, the overall outlook is positive, and the stock is likely to rally in the short term.

**Rating:** 1
