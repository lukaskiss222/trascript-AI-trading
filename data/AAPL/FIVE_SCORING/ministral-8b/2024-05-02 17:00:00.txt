Based on the earnings transcript, Apple Inc. reported strong results for Q2 Fiscal Year 2024, with revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53. The company highlighted growth in services, Mac, and iPhone, but saw a decline in iPad and Wearables, Home, and Accessories. Management provided guidance for the June quarter, expecting low-single-digit revenue growth. The company also announced an additional $110 billion for share repurchases and a 4% increase in the dividend. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key products like iPhone and iPad. However, the company's strong services growth and strategic investments in AI and enterprise market provide long-term potential.
