### Analysis:

The earnings call for Apple Inc. (AAPL) revealed a mixed bag of results. While the company reported record sales for the March quarter, driven by strong performance in emerging markets and Services, the overall revenue growth was down 3% year-over-year. The company attributed this to foreign exchange headwinds and macroeconomic challenges. Despite these headwinds, Apple's installed base of active devices reached an all-time high, indicating strong customer satisfaction and loyalty. The company also guided for similar revenue performance in the June quarter, indicating stability in the business.

### Conclusion:

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the mixed results. The strong performance in emerging markets and Services may provide some support to the stock, while the guidance for similar revenue performance in the June quarter may temper any significant upside. Overall, the stock is likely to experience modest volatility in the near term.
