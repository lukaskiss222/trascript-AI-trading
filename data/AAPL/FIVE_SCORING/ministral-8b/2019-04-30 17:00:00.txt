**Analysis:**
- **Key Points:** Apple reported strong Q2 results with $58 billion in revenue, driven by a 22% increase in iPad sales, 50% growth in Wearables, and a 16% increase in Services revenue. The company's guidance for the June quarter is $52.5 billion to $54.5 billion, with a 300 basis point negative foreign exchange impact year-over-year.
- **Management's Tone:** Tim Cook and Luca Maestri expressed confidence in Apple's growth prospects, particularly in Services and non-iPhone categories. They highlighted the positive impact of pricing adjustments and trade-in programs in China and other markets.
- **Guidance:** The guidance for the June quarter is slightly lower than expected, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange and the settlement with Qualcomm. The company expects gross margin to be between 37% and 38%, with operating expenses between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion.
- **External/Macro Influences:** The U.S.-China trade dialogue and stimulus programs in China have positively impacted Apple's performance. However, the ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and potential tariffs on iPhones could pose risks.

**Conclusion:**
The Q2 results and guidance indicate a mixed picture for Apple. While the company's growth prospects are promising, particularly in non-iPhone categories and Services, the guidance is slightly lower than expected due to foreign exchange and the Qualcomm settlement. The ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions and potential tariffs on iPhones could pose risks to Apple's performance. Overall, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral, given the mixed signals in the earnings report and the ongoing trade tensions. Therefore, the rating is:
