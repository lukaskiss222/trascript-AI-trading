Based on the earnings transcript, Apple Inc. reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012, with record sales and earnings driven by the launch of new products like the iPhone 5, iPad Mini, and iMac. The company also saw growth in its retail stores and iCloud services. However, the guidance for the December quarter was lower than expected, with revenue projected to be $52 billion, which is down from $56.8 billion in the September quarter. The company also saw a decline in gross margin, which was attributed to the launch of new products and a stronger U.S. dollar. Despite these challenges, the company remains confident in its ability to deliver strong results in the coming quarters.

The stock price of Apple Inc. is likely to face short-term pressure due to the lower-than-expected guidance and the decline in gross margin. However, the company's strong product lineup and growth in emerging markets like China suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to remain volatile in the short term, but investors should remain focused on the company's long-term prospects.
