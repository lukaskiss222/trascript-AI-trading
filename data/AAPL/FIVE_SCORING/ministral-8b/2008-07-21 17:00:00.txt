The earnings call for Apple Inc. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 revealed strong financial performance, with record sales and earnings. The company's revenue grew by 38% year-over-year, driven by robust sales of Macs, iPods, iPhones, and iTunes. The company also achieved an operating margin of 18.6%, which exceeded expectations. Despite the strong performance, the company's guidance for the September quarter was conservative, with revenue expected to grow by 25% year-over-year, and gross margin expected to decline to 31.5% due to the back-to-school promotion and a product transition.

The company's management expressed confidence in its ability to meet demand for the iPhone 3G, despite widespread stock-outs in the U.S. They also discussed their plans to launch the iPhone 3G in 22 countries by the end of July, and to continue expanding its retail presence in Europe and Asia. The company's management also addressed concerns about the health of the U.S. consumer and the impact of the economic environment on its business. They noted that they had not seen any obvious impact on the business in the June quarter, and that they had considered the economic environment among other factors in preparing their guidance.

Overall, the earnings call for Apple Inc. in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 was positive, with the company reporting strong financial performance and expressing confidence in its ability to meet demand for its products. However, the company's conservative guidance for the September quarter may temper expectations for the stock price in the short term.
