The earnings call reveals Apple’s strong financial performance in Q4 2014, boosted by the successful launch of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices. The company KJset records for iPhone and Mac sales, and its operating cash flow. Furthermore, the introduction of Apple Pay and Apple Watch as new growth categories bodes well for the company’s future. However, the currency exchange fluctuations create a headwind for the current quarter, and the iPad’s declining sales are a concern. Overall, Apple's strong product pipeline and positive outlook should contribute to moderate positive stock movement in the short term.
