Weakness in both top-line growth and margins characterized Apple's Q4 earnings. While iPhone sales grew an impressive 26%, this growth failed to boost margins, facing pressures from a strong US dollar and increased investment in customer experience enhancements, including free software updates. The pending release of new iPad products also dented margins. With a lower gross margin forecast for Q1 2014, and companies like Samsung gaining ground in the tablet market, Apple's future prohibition looks challenging. The stock is likely to face pressure in the short term. [-1]
