Apple's Q2 results exemplified the company's success in diverse markets, with exceptional growth in iPhone sales and strong Mac and iPod performance. The iPad's strong initial sales have provoked optimism, despite concerns about potential mac cannibalization. The June quarter guidance reflects the impact of aggressive iPad pricing and various transitional factors. Apple's ecosystem of innovative products, services, and accessories, coupled with its expandability strategies, positions it well for future growth, though some analysts seek clarity on iPad's impact. The stock is likely to experience a positive, yet moderate, short-term impact.
