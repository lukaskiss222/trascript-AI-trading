Apple's Q3 earnings call reveals a complex mix of results. Strong iPhone sales are a standout, contradicting saturation concerns, with emerging markets growth a positive. However, iPad sell-through declines and tepid guidance impact sentiment. Management's focus on future products and services, including iOS 7 and iWork for iCloud, hints at potential, butdataframe investors seek clarity on new offerings. The stock will feel pressure in the short term due to uncertain growth prospects.
