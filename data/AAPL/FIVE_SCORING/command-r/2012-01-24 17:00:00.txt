Apple's Q1 earnings transcript revealed impressive results driven by record-breaking iPhone and iPad sales. The 128% iPhone growth rate outpaced the market significantly. Management highlighted strong international demand and enterprise adoption. However, the March quarter guidance indicates a significant decline in revenue and gross margins due to the absence of a 14th week, higher operating expenses and a strong U.S. dollar. The stock is likely to face Richtung pressure due to these short-term factors. [0]
