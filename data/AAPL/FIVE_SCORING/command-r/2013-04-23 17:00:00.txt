Apple's Q2 earnings call reveals continued high performance despite slow growth rates and decreased margins. Management attributes the latter to strategic pricing decisions for iPad mini and iPhone 4. A robust ecosystem, strong customer satisfaction, and pending innovations in hardware, software and services are optimistic signs. However, the impending saturation of the smartphone market and rising competition trivializes Apple's market share gains. Their emphasis on long-term growth strategies and doubling down on share repurchases is a mixed signal for short-term investors.cwd
