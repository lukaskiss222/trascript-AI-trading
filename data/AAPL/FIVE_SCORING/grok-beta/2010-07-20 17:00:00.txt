Appleâ€™s strong earnings beat expectations with record revenues, driven by robust sales of iPad, iPhone, and Macs. The guidance for the next quarter is encouraging, reflecting confidence in continued strong demand and operating leverage benefits. However, negative factors include potential antenna issues with the iPhone 4 and a sequential decline in gross margins, primarily due to product transitions and higher-cost structures. The overall sentiment from management suggests optimism for future growth, but the current demand/supply challenges and the resolution of iPhone-related concerns could temper short-term stock movement expectations.
