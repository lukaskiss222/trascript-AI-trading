Apple's Q3 FY2011 earnings call showcased remarkable growth with record revenue and sales figures, particularly for iPhone and iPad, underscoring the strong market demand for these products. The surpassing of expectations, coupled with an improving supply situation for iPad, and the anticipation of launching Mac OS X Lion, iOS 5, and iCloud, supports a short-term positive outlook. However, the guidance for the next quarter was conservative, potentially factoring in new product transitions and the back-to-school period, which might cap expectations. 

Stock impact: Anticipated to rise with a positive investor response to the earnings and forward-looking statements, although tempered by conservative guidance for the next quarter.
