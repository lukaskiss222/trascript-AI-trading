Apple reported a stellar March quarter with outstanding results that exceeded expectations, highlighted by record iPhone sales, a strong Mac performance, and a successful market entry for the iPad. However, the June quarter guidance is conservative, expecting revenue growth but with significant gross margin compression due to aggressive iPad pricing, a transition in Mac hardware, currency impacts, and seasonal market dynamics affecting other product lines. 

Given Apple's ability to surprise with the iPad's demand and the increasing importance of software and services, there is a potential for the stock to maintain positive momentum in the short term, despite the margin concerns. However, the cautious guidance suggests that investor reaction might be mixed initially.
