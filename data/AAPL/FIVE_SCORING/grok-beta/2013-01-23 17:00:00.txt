Apple's Q1 earnings call indicates a very positive short-term impact on the stock price with record iPhone and iPad sales, a broadening ecosystem, and the fastest iPhone rollout ever. However, concerns include potential cannibalization of Mac sales by iPads, manufacturing constraints on new products, and a slight deceleration in year-over-year iPhone growth. The company's strategy to not fear cannibalization, especially in the context of iPad vs. PC market, suggests optimism for future growth and product diversification.
