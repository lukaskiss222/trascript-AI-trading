Apple's Q4 earnings call indicates a positive trajectory with several factors likely to influence its stock price in the short term. Record-breaking iPhone sales, strong Mac growth, particularly in non-U.S. markets, and impressive iPad demand suggest a continued upward trend in stock value. The cautious tone regarding supply chains from the Japanese earthquake introduces slight uncertainty, but this has been factored into guidance. Given the company's historical performance and product momentum, coupled with no major negative surprises, a neutral to slight positive impact is expected. [0]
