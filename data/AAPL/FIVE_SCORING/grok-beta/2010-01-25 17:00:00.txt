Apple showcased an exceptional Q1 fiscal 2010 performance, with unprecedented revenue, record sales for Macs, iPhones, and growth in international markets mirroring the company's strong demand for its products. Despite challenges like legal battles and potential supply constraints in components, the overall business momentum, new product anticipation, and the increasing enterprise adoption of iPhones appear to set a positive trend for at least the short-term. However, the cautious guidance for the March quarter and commodity market dynamics suggest a possible slight dip in gross margins. Given the record-breaking performance and steady growth in key markets, the short-term trajectory for Apple's stock looks positive.
