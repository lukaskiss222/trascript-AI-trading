The earnings report shows robust demand for Apple's new iPhone 3GS and a positive outlook for the immediate future due to upgrades and a significant acceleration in sales. However, gross margins are expected to decline due to increased component costs and promotions, which might slightly offset the positive momentum. Mac sales also performed well, surpassing market expectations despite inventory constraints on certain models. Given these factors, the stock is expected to experience a positive, though moderate, impact over the next couple of weeks.
