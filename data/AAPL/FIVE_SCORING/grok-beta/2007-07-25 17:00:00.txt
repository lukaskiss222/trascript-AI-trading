Apple's Q3 2007 earnings exceeded expectations with strong Mac and iPod sales. The launch of the iPhone garnered significant interest and despite some initial activation hiccups, customer satisfaction was extraordinarily high, suggesting a positive sentiment. However, the decision to recognize iPhone revenue over 24 months and the cautious September quarter guidance due to back-to-school promotions, product transitions, and commodity cost increases could temper investor expectations in the short term, especially given the substantial difference between this quarter's EPS and the forecasted one for the next quarter.
