Apple's Q2 2009 earnings call showcased robust performance with record non-holiday quarter results, exceeding expectations. Despite a challenging economic environment, growth in iPhone and iPod sales, particularly the iPod Touch, has been positive. However, Mac sales were down, though in line with the market, and the delay in revenue recognition for new iPhones due to OS 3.0 affects short-term outlook. Forward-looking declines in revenue and gross margin reflect seasonal trends and lower iPhone ASPs. Overall, the call suggests a likely stable to slight positive impact on Apple's stock in the upcoming weeks, anticipating the launch of OS 3.0 and muted expectations for the next quarter.
