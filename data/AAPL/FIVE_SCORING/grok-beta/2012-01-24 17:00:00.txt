Apple's fiscal Q1 2012 results were exceptionally strong, surpassing expectations across numerous categories like record iPhone sales, iPads, Macs, and a booming iTunes Store. Management's confidence in continued innovation and the positive customer response to new products like iPhone 4S and iOS 5 indicate robust momentum carries into the next quarter. Despite a minor sequential drop in gross margin due to lower leverage and non-recurring items, the long-term outlook remains very optimistic, suggesting potential upward pressure on stock price in the short to medium term.
