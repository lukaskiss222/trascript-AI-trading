Apple's Q2 earnings exceeded guidance, with strong growth in both the music and Mac segments despite the transition to Intel-based products. The anticipation of new Intel-based products and delays in universal application releases likely contributed to a pause in Mac sales, potentially affecting short-term stock performance. Nevertheless, the company's increased retail traffic, expansion in international markets, and continued excitement for future products provide a bullish outlook, suggesting a positive yet tempered reaction from the market over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
