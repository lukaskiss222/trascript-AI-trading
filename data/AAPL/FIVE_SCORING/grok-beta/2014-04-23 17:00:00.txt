Apple's Q2 2014 earnings call highlighted several positive points, including a new record in quarterly revenue with strong iPhone sales, a disciplined approach to capital allocation with increased dividends and share repurchases, and growing markets like Greater China showing triple-digit growth in iTunes. However, lower iPad sales than analyst expectations due to channel inventory adjustments and pricing challenges in the competitive U.S. smartphone market could potentially cap the stock's upward movement. The significant commitment to innovation and future products signals long-term confidence. The stock is expected to appreciate moderately due to strong earnings growth and the positive news of increased capital return to shareholders.
