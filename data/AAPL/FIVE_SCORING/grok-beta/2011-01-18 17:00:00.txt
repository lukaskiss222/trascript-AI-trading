Apple Inc. reported exceptionally strong Q1 FY11 results with record sales across its product lines, significant enterprise traction with iPhones and iPads, and a positive outlook for growth, particularly attributed to the upcoming Verizon iPhone launch. This, combined with increasing demand in the Asia-Pacific market, especially China, suggests a very positive short-term impact on its stock. However, the company's revenue guidance for the March quarter shows a sequential decline, mainly attributed to seasonal factors and channel inventory adjustments, which might temper some of the short-term enthusiasm.
