Apple's Q3 2008 results showcased record revenue, a 38% revenue growth, and the largest June quarter earnings in Apple's history, with particularly strong performances from Macs, iPods, and the initial iPhone 3G sales. However, the forward-looking gross margin guidance points to a significant drop to 30% in fiscal 2009 due to investments in new products, which might introduce pricing strategies aimed at volume growth. While Apple's consumer demand remains strong, the upcoming product transitions and lower margin expectations could temper investor enthusiasm, leading to a potential mixed reaction in the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
