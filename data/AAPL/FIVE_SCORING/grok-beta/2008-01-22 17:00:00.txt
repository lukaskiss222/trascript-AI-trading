Despite Apple delivering an outstanding Q4 with record sales across all product lines, investor concerns might stem from several factors in this earnings call:

1. **Forward Guidance**: Apple's guidance for $0.94 EPS in the subsequent quarter projects a nearly 47% decline from the record-setting Q4, which could spark some concern even though this is typical seasonal behavior. However, this sequential decline appears less aggressive than last year's (when EPS was $1.13 and was guided to $0.87).
   
2. **Mac Channel Inventory**: With Mac inventory levels ending far below target ranges, it suggests strong sales but potential future supply constraints, which could impact short-term stock performance.

3. **iPod and iPhone Market Dynamics**: The intriguing comment on no evidence of cannibalization between iPhone and iPod in Europe, coupled with no clear answer for the U.S., might create uncertainty about iPod's future market position and growth, especially given the launch of iPod Touch which could have played a role in the flatness of iPod alone.

4. **Economic Signals**: There was an oblique reference to a potential difference in holiday buying patterns in the U.S., which could imply concerns about consumer spending behavior in a possibly weakening economic environment.

Considering these factors, Apple demonstrates strong fundamentals with an exceptionally profitable quarter and high stock demand, yet has provided more conservative guidance than some might expect. The stock likely experiences some pullback due to interpreting the guidance as cautious or reflecting weakness, though the positive sentiment for Apple's future innovations and products remains steadfast.
