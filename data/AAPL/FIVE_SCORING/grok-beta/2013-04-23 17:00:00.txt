Apple's Q2 2013 earnings showed strong performance with continued record-breaking sales in iPhones and iPads despite tempered growth rate guidance for the next quarter. The company's substantial increase in capital return through dividends and the largest share buyback in history aims to appease investors amidst slowed growth. Management's confidence in new product releases later this year and significant ongoing investment in innovation and the ecosystem, suggest a positive long-term outlook, potentially shoring up any short-term negative sentiments from the guidance.
