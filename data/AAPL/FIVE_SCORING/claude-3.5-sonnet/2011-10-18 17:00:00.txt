Based on this earnings call, I anticipate a significantly positive short-term impact on Apple's stock price. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Exceptional iPhone 4S launch with over 4 million units sold in first 3 days, dramatically exceeding the iPhone 4's 1.7 million launch
2. Strong guidance of $37 billion revenue for next quarter, well above expectations
3. Continued explosive growth in China (270% year-over-year) and other emerging markets
4. Record iPad sales of 11.1 million units with no signs of slowing demand
5. Management's confident tone about product pipeline and ability to meet holiday demand

While there were some minor concerns (Thailand supply chain, Q4 iPhone sales pause), the overwhelming positives and extremely strong guidance suggest the stock should rally in the near term.
