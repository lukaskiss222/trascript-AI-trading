Based on this highly detailed earnings call transcript, I assess that this will likely have a significantly positive impact on Apple's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key reasons:

1. Record-breaking financial results across multiple metrics - revenue, Mac sales, iPhone sales beating BlackBerry, and becoming the #3 mobile phone company by revenue.

2. Very strong iPhone momentum with 6.9M units sold and expansion to 51 countries, with Steve Jobs directly highlighting the success.

3. Healthy gross margins at 34.7% despite new product launches, beating expectations.

4. $24.5B in cash with zero debt provides exceptional stability during economic uncertainty.

5. While guidance was conservative, management (including Steve Jobs himself) expressed strong confidence in their competitive position and product lineup heading into the holiday season.

The presence of Steve Jobs on the call and his detailed, optimistic commentary adds significant credibility and should boost investor confidence despite broader economic concerns.
