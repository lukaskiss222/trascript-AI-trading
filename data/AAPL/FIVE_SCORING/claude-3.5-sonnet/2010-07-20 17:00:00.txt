Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a clearly positive short-term impact on Apple's stock price for the following reasons:

1. Exceptional financial performance with revenue up 61% year-over-year and significantly beating expectations across major product lines (iPhone, iPad, Mac).

2. Extremely strong demand for new products (iPad, iPhone 4) with the company unable to meet demand due to supply constraints rather than demand issues.

3. Expanding international growth opportunities, particularly in Asia Pacific where Mac sales grew 73% YoY and even stronger in specific markets like China (144% growth).

4. Strong enterprise adoption with 80% of Fortune 100 companies deploying/piloting iPhone and 50% testing iPad within first 90 days.

5. Management's confident tone regarding product pipeline and ability to scale production to meet overwhelming demand.

The only minor concerns (antenna issues, gross margin pressure) appear well-managed and are overshadowed by the tremendous growth and demand signals.
