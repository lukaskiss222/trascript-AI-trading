Based on the earnings call transcript, Apple demonstrated exceptional performance across multiple product lines and geographies. Key highlights include:

1. Record iPhone sales of 18.6M units (113% YoY growth)
2. Strong iPad demand although supply constrained
3. Mac sales growth of 28% vs PC market decline of 3%
4. Remarkable growth in China (250% iPhone growth)
5. Healthy gross margins at 41.4%
6. Strong enterprise adoption of both iPhone and iPad
7. Conservative but still strong guidance for next quarter

The management team displayed confidence in their product pipeline and ability to execute despite some supply chain challenges from Japan. While guidance was conservative, this is typical for Apple and the underlying business momentum remains very strong.

Given the record results, strong growth across products/regions, and continued momentum in key strategic areas (enterprise, China), I expect this earnings report to have a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
