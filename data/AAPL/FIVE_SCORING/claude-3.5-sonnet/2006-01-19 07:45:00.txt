Based on the earnings call transcript, I predict a significant positive impact on Apple's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's why:

1. The company reported exceptional Q1 results with revenue of $5.75B (up 65% YoY) and record-breaking iPod sales of over 14 million units. iPod gross margins were above 20%.

2. Management's tone was very confident, highlighting strong demand across products and channels, with iPod inventory still below target ranges indicating continued strong demand.

3. While Q2 guidance was conservative at $4.3B revenue, this appears to be typical Apple conservatism, especially given their history of beating guidance. The Intel transition was well-explained and appears manageable.

This combination of record results, strong product momentum, and manageable risks suggests the stock should react positively as investors digest the strong fundamentals.
