Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Apple's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong Financial Performance:
- Record Q3 revenue of $7.46B (+38% YoY)
- Record Mac sales of 2.5M units (+41% YoY)
- Strong iPod growth (11M units, +12% YoY)
- Successful iPhone 3G launch with 1M units sold in first 3 days

2. Forward-Looking Positives:
- Confident guidance of $7.8B revenue for Q4
- Strong international expansion plans (20+ new countries for iPhone)
- Robust App Store momentum (25M downloads in first week)
- Management extremely confident in hitting 10M iPhone goal for 2008

While there are some potential concerns around gross margin guidance and product transitions, the overall strong execution, market share gains, and momentum across all major product lines should drive positive sentiment in the near term.
