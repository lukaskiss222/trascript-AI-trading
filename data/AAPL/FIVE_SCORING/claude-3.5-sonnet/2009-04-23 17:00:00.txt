Based on the earnings transcript, I predict a positive short-term impact on Apple's stock price for the following reasons:

1. The company reported record non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings, beating expectations with strong margins of 36.4% despite the challenging economic environment.

2. iPhone sales showed impressive growth of 123% year-over-year with 3.8 million units sold, while iPod Touch sales more than doubled and the App Store approached 1 billion downloads.

3. Management maintained a confident outlook with new products in the pipeline, the upcoming iPhone OS 3.0 launch, and Steve Jobs' planned return in June, while effectively managing costs and preserving their strong cash position.
