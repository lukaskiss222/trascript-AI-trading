Based on this earnings transcript, I anticipate a significantly positive short-term impact on Apple's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Record-breaking financial results with strong growth across all major product lines:
- Revenue of $6.22B (up 29%)
- Mac sales hit all-time high of 2.16M units (up 34%)
- iPod sales of 10.2M units (up 17%)
- iPhone sales exceeded expectations at 1.1M units

2. Strong forward guidance:
- Revenue guidance of $9.2B for next quarter, well above Street expectations
- Management expressed high confidence about holiday season with "strongest product lineup in Apple history"
- Clear momentum in Mac and iPod segments heading into key holiday quarter

3. Healthy margin profile and cash generation:
- Gross margins of 33.6% exceeded expectations
- Strong cash flow from operations at $1.7B
- Cash balance increased to $15.4B

The combination of excellent current results, robust guidance, and strong operational execution suggests meaningful upside potential for the stock in the near term.
