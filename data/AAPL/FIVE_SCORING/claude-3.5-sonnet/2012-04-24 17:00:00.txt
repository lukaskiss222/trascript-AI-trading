Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Apple's stock price (1-2 weeks). Key positive factors include:

1. Exceptionally strong iPhone and iPad sales numbers, with iPhone sales up 88% YoY and iPad sales up 151% YoY

2. Explosive growth in China, with revenue up 3x YoY to $7.9B and strong momentum across all product lines

3. Healthy gross margins at 47.4%, significantly above guidance

4. Strong enterprise adoption with 94% of Fortune 500 companies testing/deploying iPads

While there are some minor concerns around conservative guidance and potential supply constraints, the overall tone was very confident and the core business metrics were outstanding. The company appears to be executing extremely well across all major product lines and geographies.
