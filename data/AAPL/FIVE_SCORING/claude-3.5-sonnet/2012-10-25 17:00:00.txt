Based on the earnings call transcript, I would provide a positive outlook for Apple's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong product lineup heading into holiday season with multiple new products (iPhone 5, iPad Mini, new Macs) showing robust demand and supply improvements

2. Clear confidence from management about meeting $52B revenue guidance despite shorter quarter, with iPhone/iPad expected to see large sequential increases

3. While margins are lower due to new product launches, this appears to be transitory as cost curves improve, and management emphasized maintaining premium positioning rather than competing on price

The stock should react positively as investors gain confidence in Apple's execution through the critical holiday quarter, despite some margin pressure. The broad product refresh and supply improvements removing key overhangs.
