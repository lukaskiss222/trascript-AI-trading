Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a strong positive impact on Apple's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Exceptional iPhone 6/6 Plus demand significantly exceeding supply, with record launch numbers and strong backlog heading into the holiday quarter

2. Very strong guidance for next quarter ($63.5-66.5B revenue) despite FX headwinds, suggesting continued momentum

3. Record Mac sales and market share gains despite overall PC market decline

4. Successful launch of Apple Pay and positive early reception

While there are some minor concerns around iPad sales decline and currency headwinds, the core iPhone business is showing exceptional strength heading into the critical holiday quarter. Management's tone was notably confident about near-term prospects.
