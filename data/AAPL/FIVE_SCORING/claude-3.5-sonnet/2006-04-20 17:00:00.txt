Based on my analysis of this extensive earnings call transcript, here is my assessment of the likely 1-2 week stock impact:

Key Positives:
- Strong overall revenue growth (+34% YoY)
- iPod market share increased to 78% in US
- Favorable component pricing environment
- iTunes profitability above break-even

Key Concerns:
- Continued "pause" in Mac sales due to Intel transition
- Lower guidance for next quarter margins
- Some softness in retail store performance
- International iPod market share significantly lower

Overall Assessment:
While the company delivered solid results, the guidance and commentary suggests near-term headwinds from the Intel transition and margin pressure. The "pause" in Mac sales could continue into next quarter, and management was cautious on several fronts. While the longer-term story remains intact, the next 1-2 weeks may see some pressure on the stock as investors digest the more conservative outlook.
