This appears to be just the opening introduction of Apple's earnings call from 2005, without any actual financial results or substantive discussion. Without the core content of the earnings call including financial performance, guidance, and management commentary, I cannot make a meaningful assessment of its likely impact on the stock price. 

Since this is only the procedural opening of the call, I must rate it as neutral.
