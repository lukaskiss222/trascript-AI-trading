Based on the earnings call transcript, I would give Apple a rating of 1 (Positive impact) for the following key reasons:

1. While growth has slowed and margins have decreased, Apple reported record March quarter revenue and strong iPad/iPhone sales, demonstrating continued robust demand for core products.

2. The company announced a massive expansion of its capital return program to $100B through 2015, including the largest share buyback in corporate history ($60B) and a 15% dividend increase, showing confidence in future cash generation.

3. Management expressed strong confidence in upcoming product pipeline, with Tim Cook specifically highlighting "amazing new hardware, software and services" coming in fall 2013 and throughout 2014.

However, I did not give it a 2 rating because:
- Year-over-year growth rates have clearly decelerated 
- Gross margins are facing continued pressure (guidance of 36-37%)
- The company acknowledged competitive challenges in smartphones

The overall tone and substance suggests modest positive momentum for the stock over the next 1-2 weeks, particularly given the significant capital return announcement, but not enough for a dramatic rally.
