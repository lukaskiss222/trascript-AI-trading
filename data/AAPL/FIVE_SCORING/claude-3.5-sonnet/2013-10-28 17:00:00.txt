Based on the earnings call transcript, Apple delivered a strong quarter with record iPhone sales and robust guidance. Key positives include:

1. Strong revenue guidance of $55-58B and gross margins of 36.5-37.5%
2. Record iPhone sales of 33.8M units, up 26% YoY
3. Significant growth in emerging markets like China
4. Successful launch of new iPhones with 9M units sold in first weekend
5. Healthy cash position and ongoing capital returns

While there are some minor headwinds around supply constraints for new products and FX impacts, overall tone was very confident about holiday quarter demand across product lines. The gross margin guidance would have been even stronger (around 38.5%) if not for accounting changes around software deferrals.

Given the strong holiday quarter guidance, successful new product launches, and management's confident tone about demand, I expect the stock to react positively in the near-term.
