Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Apple's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include:

1. Strong iPhone sales growth (31.2M units, up 20% YoY) especially in emerging markets, with broad geographic strength
2. Gross margins at high end of guidance (36.9%)
3. Clear hints at new products coming in fall 2013 and throughout 2014
4. Strong ecosystem metrics (App Store records, iTunes growth)
5. Solid guidance for next quarter

While there were some concerns around iPad sales decline and China growth, the overall tone was confident and forward-looking, with multiple growth catalysts ahead. Management's commentary suggests they remain in strong competitive position and have meaningful product launches approaching.
