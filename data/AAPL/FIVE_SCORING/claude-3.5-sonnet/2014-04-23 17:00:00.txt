Based on this earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Apple's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong iPhone performance with 43.7M units sold, beating expectations and showing particular strength in emerging markets including China where they set new records. This demonstrates continued growth potential in key markets.

2. Gross margins came in at 39.3%, above guidance and showing the company's ability to maintain profitability despite competitive pressures. The guidance for next quarter, while lower, was still relatively healthy.

3. The significant expansion of capital return program to $130B (from $100B) and an 8% dividend increase signals strong confidence from management and should support the stock price.

While there were some concerns around iPad sales growth, the overall tone was very confident and the results demonstrated Apple's continued ability to execute at a high level across most metrics.
