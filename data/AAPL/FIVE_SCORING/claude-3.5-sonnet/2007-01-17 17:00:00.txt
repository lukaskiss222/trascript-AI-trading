Based on the earnings call transcript, I am very bullish on Apple's near-term stock outlook. Key positives include:

1. Exceptional Q1 performance with revenue of $7.1B (+24% YoY) and record net income of $1B (+78% YoY)

2. Strong iPod sales of 21.1M units (+50% YoY) with market share gains internationally

3. Mac sales grew 28% YoY, outpacing the broader PC market by 3x

4. Gross margins hit 31.2%, well above guidance due to favorable commodity costs and product mix

5. Management's confident tone regarding iPhone launch and future product pipeline

While Q2 guidance was conservative, this is typical for Apple. The core business momentum across iPods and Macs, combined with upcoming catalysts like iPhone and Leopard OS, should drive continued stock appreciation in the next 1-2 weeks.
