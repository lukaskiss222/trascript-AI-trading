Based on the Q1 2008 earnings call transcript, I predict a strong positive impact on Apple's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for several key reasons:

1. The company reported record-breaking results across multiple metrics:
- Revenue up 35% YoY to $9.6B
- Mac sales up 44% YoY (2.32M units)
- iPod sales hit new record (22.1M units)
- iPhone sales of 2.3M units showing strong momentum
- Gross margins were higher than expected at 34.7%

2. Management expressed high confidence in their product pipeline and 2008 outlook, reaffirming the 10M iPhone target and announcing expansion plans for Best Buy distribution from 286 to 600 stores.

3. While guidance was typically conservative, the underlying business fundamentals and management commentary suggested continued strong momentum across all major product lines.

The combination of exceptional Q1 performance, strong product cycle momentum, and management's confident outlook points to likely positive stock price movement in the near term.
