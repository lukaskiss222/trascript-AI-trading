Apple reported extremely strong results with record iPhone and iPad sales, along with robust growth across most key metrics. Key positives include:

1. Record revenue of $54.5B and strong iPhone sales of 47.8M units (39% growth)
2. iPad sales of 22.9M units (60% growth) with strong adoption in enterprise/government
3. Significant expansion of ecosystem with record iTunes/App Store revenue
4. Strong performance in China with iPhone sales doubling year-over-year
5. Healthy gross margins at 38.6% and over $137B in cash

While guidance was slightly below some expectations, this appears more due to conservative forecasting changes rather than fundamental issues. The company's continued strong execution, robust ecosystem growth, and significant international expansion suggest positive momentum.

The stock should respond positively in the short-term given the strong results and healthy outlook.
