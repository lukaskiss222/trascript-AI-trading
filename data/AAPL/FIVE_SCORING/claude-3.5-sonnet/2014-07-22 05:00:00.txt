Based on the earnings call transcript, Apple delivered strong overall performance with several positive indicators, though there are some mixed signals. 

Key positives:
- Record Q3 revenue of $37.4B and strong iPhone sales (35.2M units)
- Gross margins exceeded guidance at 39.4%
- Very strong performance in BRIC countries (China iPhone sales up 48%)
- Strong Mac growth of 18% YoY
- Strategic partnerships with IBM for enterprise expansion
- Management's confident tone about new products pipeline

Some concerns:
- iPad sales declined YoY and missed expectations
- Guidance for next quarter implies lower margins
- Some softness in mature markets
- Tax and regulatory headwinds in Japan

However, the overall tone was quite positive with management expressing strong confidence about future products, the IBM partnership, and continued growth opportunities. The healthy margins, strong iPhone performance in emerging markets, and strategic initiatives suggest positive momentum heading into the key fall product cycle.
