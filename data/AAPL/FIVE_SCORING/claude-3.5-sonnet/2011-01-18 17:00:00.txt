Based on this extensive earnings call transcript, I provide the following short-term stock price analysis:

The earnings report was exceptionally strong with record-breaking results across multiple metrics:
- Revenue up 71% to $26.7B
- iPhone sales up 86% to 16.2M units
- iPad sales of 7.3M units
- Strong growth in all geographic regions, especially Asia/China
- Robust margins at 38.5%

Key positive factors:
- Strong guidance for next quarter
- Verizon iPhone launch upcoming
- Supply constraints indicate strong demand
- International expansion opportunities
- Enterprise adoption accelerating
- Healthy product pipeline indicated

Minor concerns:
- Some supply constraints limiting sales
- Sequential decline expected in March quarter
- Component cost uncertainties

Given the stellar results, strong guidance, upcoming Verizon catalyst, and management's extremely confident tone, this earnings report should drive significant positive momentum in the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
