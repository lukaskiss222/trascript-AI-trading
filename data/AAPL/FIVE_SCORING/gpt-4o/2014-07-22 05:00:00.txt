Apple's earnings call highlights strong financial performance driven by robust sales of iPhones and Macs, expansions in China, and flourishing developer and services ecosystems. CEO Tim Cook detailed innovations in software such as iOS 8, OS X Yosemite, and new initiatives like collaboration with IBM, which could further penetrate enterprise markets.
