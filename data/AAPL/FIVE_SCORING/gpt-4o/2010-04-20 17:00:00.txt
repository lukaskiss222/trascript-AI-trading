Apple's fiscal Q2 2010 performance exceeded expectations, with record non-holiday quarter results and strong growth in iPhone and Mac sales. The company demonstrated impressive geographic expansion and customer enthusiasm for new products like the iPad. Despite potential short-term margin declines due to aggressive pricing of the iPad, the robust sales growth, particularly in the iPhone segment, and a confident outlook for upcoming product launches suggest a positive market reaction. The upbeat tone and exceeding expectations are likely to drive a short-term positive impact on the stock.
