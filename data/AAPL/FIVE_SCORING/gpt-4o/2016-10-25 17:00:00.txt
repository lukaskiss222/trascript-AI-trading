Apple reported strong financial results for Q4 2016, hitting the high end of their revenue guidance and reporting record service revenue growth. Despite concerns about supply constraints for iPhone 7 Plus and foreign exchange impacts, the company provided optimistic guidance for the December quarter, with expectations of returning to growth. Management highlighted robust demand for the iPhone, especially with carrier incentives in the U.S., and growth in markets like India, indicating a positive outlook. The upbeat tone and strong demand suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock.
