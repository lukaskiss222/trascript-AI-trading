Apple Inc.'s third-quarter earnings report for fiscal year 2011 showcases exceptional performance with record-high quarterly revenue and earnings, driven primarily by robust sales of iPhones and iPads. The company reports an 82% year-over-year revenue increase and sets new quarterly records for iPhone and iPad sales. Despite acknowledging potential short-term gross margin declines due to a product transition, Apple demonstrates strong market presence across regions, especially in Asia-Pacific. The positive market dynamics, record financial performance, and innovative product pipeline suggest a short-term positive impact on the stock price.
