Apple reported a very strong financial performance for Q3 FY 2021, with record revenue growth driven by iPhone sales and services. Despite potential supply constraints and uncertainties due to COVID-19, the strength in emerging markets, resilience across product categories, and strong consumer response to innovations like the 5G-capable iPhone 12 suggests continued positive momentum. Management's tone was optimistic and confident about their ongoing growth initiatives and market demand across geographic segments. In the short term, the strong financial results and positive guidance likely suggest a favorable impact on Apple's stock.
