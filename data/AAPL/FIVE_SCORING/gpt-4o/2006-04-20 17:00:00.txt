Apple reported strong results, with revenues of $4.36 billion, driven by continued growth in its music and Mac businesses. The transition to Intel processors in Macs is noted as a positive development, although there was a temporary pause in demand as customers anticipated new releases. Despite this, overall sentiment is positive with a favorable component pricing environment and robust music sales, especially iPods, now commanding a 78% market share in the U.S. The company's guidance suggests continued strength, albeit with a modest outlook due to seasonal effects and ongoing transitions, which should not significantly dent investor optimism short-term.
