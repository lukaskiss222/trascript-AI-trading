Apple's Q4 Fiscal Year 2021 earnings call showcased robust performance despite supply constraints, with a 29% increase in quarterly revenue and strong growth across all product categories and services. CEO Tim Cook emphasized overcoming supply chain issues and significant demand for the new iPhone 13 lineup and other products. Apple's strategic expansion in services, consistent customer loyalty, and strong financials despite chip shortages indicate positive sentiment, likely supporting the stock's short-term potential for gains as investors react to continued high demand and effective supply chain management.
