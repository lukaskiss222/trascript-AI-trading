Apple reported a record-breaking first quarter of 2006, driven by robust iPod sales and solid Mac performance, surpassing their own revenue and earnings expectations. The strong reception of the new Intel-based Macs at Mac World and the excellent channel inventory management indicate positive momentum. Despite conservative guidance for the next quarter due to seasonal declines and potential Intel transition impacts, the upbeat market response and effective product strategy suggest a likely positive stock impact in the short term.
