Apple's Q4 2009 earnings reflected very strong performance, marked by record-breaking revenue and net income, significantly surpassing market expectations. The robust demand for iPhones, including substantial expansion into new markets like China, alongside strong Mac sales growth, particularly for portables, indicates consumer confidence in Apple's products despite a challenging economic environment. This exceptional performance, combined with the positive outlook for the upcoming holiday season and strategic expansions, is likely to have a positive short-term impact on Apple's stock.
