Apple's Q3 2009 earnings call highlighted record revenue and earnings, particularly in challenging economic conditions. The positive reception of new product launches, including the iPhone 3GS and updated Mac lineup, indicates strong demand and customer enthusiasm. The guidance for the coming quarter includes modest growth, though management noted supply constraints for the iPhone 3GS. Overall, the upbeat tone and strong sales performance suggest a likely positive short-term impact on Apple's stock in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
