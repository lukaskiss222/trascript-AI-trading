Apple's earnings call revealed strong performance with record sales in iPhones and iPads, leading to the company's highest quarterly revenue and net income. The enthusiastic response to new product launches like the iPhone 5 and iPad mini indicates significant consumer demand and suggests continued growth in the international market, particularly in Greater China. Although some supply constraints for the iPad mini and iMac were noted, the very positive performance and upbeat guidance point towards a likely positive impact on the stock in the short term (1â€“2 weeks), driven by high demand and a robust ecosystem expansion.
