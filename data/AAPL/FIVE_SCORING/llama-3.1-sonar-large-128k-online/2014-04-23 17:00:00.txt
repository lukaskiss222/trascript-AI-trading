Apple's Q2 2014 earnings transcript indicates several positive factors that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Strong Revenue and Profit**: Apple reported $45.6 billion in revenue and $10.2 billion in net profit, beating consensus estimates and setting a new March quarter record. This strong performance is likely to bolster investor confidence[1][3][4].
- **iPhone Sales**: The company sold 43.7 million iPhones, a 17% year-over-year increase, driven by significant growth in China and other emerging markets. This robust sales performance is a key driver of Apple's success[1][3][4].
- **Services Growth**: iTunes software and services revenue grew by 11% year-over-year, reaching a new quarterly record, which adds to Apple's revenue diversification and growth potential[1][3][4].
- **Capital Return Program**: Apple announced an expansion of its capital return program, increasing the share repurchase authorization to $90 billion and raising the dividend by 8%. This move signals confidence in Apple's future and is likely to be well-received by shareholders[1][3][4].
- **Positive Guidance**: Despite the anticipated sequential decline in revenue for the June quarter, Apple's guidance remains strong, with expectations of revenue between $36 billion and $38 billion, which is still ahead of the previous year's quarter[1][3][4].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
