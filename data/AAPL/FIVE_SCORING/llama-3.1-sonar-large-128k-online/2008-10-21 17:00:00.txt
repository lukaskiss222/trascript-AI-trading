The transcript of Apple's Q4 2008 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Record-Breaking Performance**: Apple reported record sales of Macs, iPhones, and iPods, and achieved significant revenue and earnings growth. This strong performance is generally positive for the stock[1%.

2. **Non-GAAP Financial Measures**: The introduction of non-GAAP financial measures to account for the impact of subscription accounting on iPhone sales provides a clearer picture of the company's performance, highlighting the substantial contribution of iPhone sales. This transparency could be seen as positive by investors[1%.

3. **Economic Uncertainty**: Despite the strong results, there is caution expressed about the impact of the global economic slowdown on future sales. This prudence in guidance, particularly for the December quarter, might temper investor enthusiasm and lead to some volatility in the stock price.

4. **Product Line and Market Position**: Apple's strong product lineup, including new MacBooks and the successful iPhone 3G, along with its expanding geographic reach and market share gains, are positive indicators. However, the company's reluctance to enter lower-priced market segments and the potential impact of economic conditions on consumer spending could introduce some uncertainty[1%.

5. **Cash Position and Financial Health**: Apple's significant cash reserves and lack of debt provide stability and the ability to invest through the economic downturn, which is a positive factor.

Given these points, the overall sentiment is positive but tempered by economic uncertainties. The strong performance and robust product lineup are likely to support the stock, but the cautious guidance might prevent a significant rally.
