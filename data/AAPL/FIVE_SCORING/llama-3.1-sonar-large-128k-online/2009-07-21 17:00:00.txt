Apple's Q3 2009 earnings transcript indicates several positive factors that are likely to have a favorable impact on the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

- **Record Non-Holiday Quarter Performance**: Apple reported record revenue and earnings for a non-holiday quarter, with $8.34 billion in revenue and $1.23 billion in net income, exceeding expectations[1][3][4].
- **Strong iPhone Sales**: The iPhone 3GS saw tremendous demand, with 5.2 million units sold in the quarter, a 626% increase from the year-ago quarter. Despite supply constraints, the strong sales and customer response are positive indicators[1][3][4].
- **Gross Margin and Cost Management**: Apple's gross margin was 36.3%, better than expected, driven by component costs not increasing as much as anticipated, lower operating expenses, and efficient product ramp-ups[1][3][4].
- **Cash and Financial Health**: The company's cash and marketable securities increased to $31.1 billion, indicating strong financial health and a comfortable investment portfolio[1][3][4].
- **Positive Guidance**: Apple provided strong guidance for the September quarter, expecting revenue between $8.7 billion and $8.9 billion and EPS in the range of $1.18 to $1.23[1][3][4].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
