Apple's Q4 FY2021 earnings report and the subsequent conference call revealed several key points that influence the short-term outlook for the company's stock:

## Supply Chain Constraints
Apple faced significant supply chain constraints, estimated at around $6 billion in revenue impact for Q4, due to chip shortages and COVID-related manufacturing disruptions. Despite this, the company achieved a September quarter revenue record of $83.4 billion. However, the constraints are expected to be even larger in the December quarter, which could continue to impact revenue[1][3][4].

## Demand and Growth
Despite the constraints, Apple reported robust demand across all product categories, with iPhone revenue up 47% year-over-year and services revenue reaching an all-time high of $18.3 billion. The company is optimistic about future demand, especially with the launch of new products like the iPhone 13 and the M1-powered MacBook Pro[1][3][4].

## Financial Performance
Apple's financial performance was strong, with a record September quarter revenue and earnings per share. However, the revenue figure was slightly below analyst expectations, leading to a drop in the stock price in after-hours trading[1][3][4].

## Guidance and Outlook
For the December quarter, Apple expects solid year-over-year revenue growth despite larger supply constraints. The company does not provide specific revenue guidance but anticipates a new revenue record for the quarter. Gross margins are expected to be between 41.5% and 42.5%, which is flat to slightly down from the September quarter due to higher costs associated with new product launches[1][3][4].

Given these points, here are the implications for the stock:

- **Short-term Pressure**: The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered revenue guidance and the ongoing supply chain constraints, which are expected to worsen in the December quarter.
- **Robust Demand**: However, the robust demand and the strong performance of services and new product launches suggest that the long-term outlook remains positive.

### Conclusion
The short-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be negative due to the supply chain constraints and the slightly missed revenue expectations, despite the overall strong performance and positive long-term outlook.
