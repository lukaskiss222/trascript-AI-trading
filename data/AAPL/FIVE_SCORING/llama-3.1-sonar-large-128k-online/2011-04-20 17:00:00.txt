The earnings transcript for Apple Inc. for the second quarter of fiscal year 2011 presents several key points that are likely to influence the company's stock price in the short term:

1. **Record Revenue and Profit**: Apple reported record revenue and net profit, driven by strong sales of iPhones, iPads, and Macs. This robust performance is likely to positively impact investor sentiment[4|.
2. **iPhone and iPad Demand**: The company saw significant growth in iPhone and iPad sales, with demand outpacing supply, particularly for the iPad 2. This high demand, especially for new products, indicates strong market reception and could continue to drive positive investor sentiment[4|.
3. **Supply Chain and Japan Earthquake**: While the Japan earthquake had some revenue impact, Apple's supply chain and contingency plans have mitigated most of the risks for the current quarter. However, there are still uncertainties beyond Q3, which might introduce some caution[4|.
4. **Guidance**: Apple provided strong guidance for the June quarter, expecting revenue growth of 46% year-over-year and EPS growth of 43%. Despite a sequential decline from Q2, the year-over-year growth is robust and should reassure investors[4|.
5. **Market and Competitive Position**: The company's dominant position in the market, particularly in the U.S. with iOS outreaching Android by a significant margin, and its strong enterprise adoption, further solidify its competitive advantage[4%.

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, highlighting Apple's strong performance, robust demand for its products, and confident outlook. However, the sequential decline in revenue and some supply chain uncertainties might introduce a slight caution.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results, high demand for products, and the company's confident guidance.
