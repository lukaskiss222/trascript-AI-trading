The earnings transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q1 FY 2016 reveals several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Factors:
- Apple reported record quarterly revenue of $75.9 billion and record quarterly net income of $18.4 billion, despite a challenging global macroeconomic environment[1][2][4].
- The company saw strong performance in Greater China, with revenue growing 14% year-over-year and 47% sequentially[4].
- There was significant growth in the services segment, with a 15% increase in services revenue, driven by strong App Store performance[4].
- Appleâ€™s installed base has grown to over 1 billion active devices, which is a strong foundation for recurring revenues[4].

## Negative Factors:
- The guidance for the March quarter implies a double-digit decline in revenue at the midpoint, largely due to macroeconomic weaknesses, foreign exchange headwinds, and higher prices in certain international markets[4].
- The company anticipates a tough year-over-year compare for Q2 due to supply constraints and macroeconomic factors from the previous year[4].
- There is a potential decline in iPhone units for fiscal Q2, which could impact overall revenue[4].

## Conclusion:
Given the mixed signals, the short-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be influenced more by the downward guidance for the next quarter and the macroeconomic uncertainties rather than the current quarter's strong performance. However, Apple's strong financial position, growing services segment, and loyal customer base provide a solid foundation for long-term growth.
