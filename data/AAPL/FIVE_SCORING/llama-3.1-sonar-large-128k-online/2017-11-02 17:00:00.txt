Apple's Q4 FY2017 earnings transcript indicates several positive factors that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Apple reported a record September quarter revenue of $52.6 billion, a 12% increase from the year-ago quarter, and a 24% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.07. This exceeds expectations and sets a strong foundation for investor confidence[2][3].
- **Robust Guidance**: The company provided bullish guidance for the December quarter, expecting revenue between $84 billion and $87 billion, which is above historical averages and suggests a strong holiday season[2][3].
- **Product Momentum**: The launch of iPhone X, along with strong sales of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, and significant growth in other product categories like Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, indicate a robust product lineup. The iPhone X launch, despite some initial supply constraints, is expected to drive further growth[2][3].
- **Services Growth**: Apple’s Services segment saw an all-time record revenue of $8.5 billion, up 34% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. This growth is sustainable and adds to the company’s revenue diversification[2][3].
- **Geographic Growth**: Apple reported strong growth in emerging markets, including a 40% increase in revenue outside of greater China, and a doubling of revenue in India. This suggests expanding market reach and potential for further growth[2][3].

Given these factors, the overall tone of the earnings call is highly positive, indicating strong performance, robust guidance, and significant growth opportunities across various segments.
