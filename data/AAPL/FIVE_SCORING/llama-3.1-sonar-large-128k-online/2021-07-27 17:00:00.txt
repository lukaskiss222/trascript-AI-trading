Apple's Q3 FY 2021 earnings call highlighted several key points that suggest a positive but cautious short-term outlook for the stock:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Apple reported a record June quarter revenue of $81.4 billion, a 36% year-over-year increase, and strong double-digit growth across all product and services categories. This exceeded analyst expectations and indicates robust demand for Apple's products and services[2][3].
  
- **Services Growth**: While services revenue set a new all-time high, the growth rate is expected to normalize in the September quarter due to easier compares from the previous year's COVID-19 impacts. However, the overall services segment remains a significant growth driver[2][3].

- **Supply Constraints**: Apple faces greater supply constraints in the September quarter, particularly for iPhone and iPad, which could impact revenue growth. However, the company has managed to mitigate some of these constraints in the past quarter[2][3].

- **Geographic and Product Strength**: The company saw strong growth across all geographic segments and product categories, including emerging markets. This broad-based strength is a positive indicator[2].

- **Management's Tone and Guidance**: Despite the strong performance, management's tone was cautious due to ongoing uncertainties such as COVID-19 and supply chain constraints. The lack of specific revenue guidance for the next quarter adds to this cautious outlook[2][3].

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive but not overly enthusiastic reaction in the short term. The strong financial performance and continued growth in services and product sales are positives, but the caution around supply constraints and the normalization of services growth rate may temper immediate gains.

**Rating: 1**
