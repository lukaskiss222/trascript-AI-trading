Apple's Q2 2010 earnings call highlighted several key points that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Performance**: Apple reported record-breaking results, including the best non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings, highest quarterly iPhone sales, and new records for Mac sales. This strong performance is likely to boost investor confidence.

2. **iPhone and iPad Momentum**: The iPhone saw significant year-over-year growth, and the iPad's initial sales exceeded expectations. This momentum, especially in international markets, is a positive indicator.

3. **Guidance and Margins**: Despite the strong results, Apple's guidance for the June quarter included a sequential decline in gross margin due to factors such as the iPad's aggressive pricing, stronger U.S. dollar, and product transitions. However, the overall revenue growth guidance remains robust.

4. **Market Expansion and Product Innovation**: Apple's expansion into new countries, addition of new carriers, and ongoing product innovation (e.g., iPhone OS4, new MacBook Pro line) suggest sustained growth potential.

Given these points, the strong performance and positive momentum in key product segments are likely to outweigh the temporary margin pressures, leading to a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
