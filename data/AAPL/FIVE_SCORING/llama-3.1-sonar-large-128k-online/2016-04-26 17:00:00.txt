The transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q2 2016 earnings call reveals several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Revenue and Guidance
Apple reported a revenue decline of 13% year-over-year, largely due to macroeconomic headwinds, strong U.S. dollar, and challenging comparisons to the previous year's exceptional iPhone sales. The company guided for a revenue range of $41 billion to $43 billion for the next quarter, which is below market estimates, partly due to planned channel inventory reductions and the impact of the iPhone SE on ASPs and margins[5,.

## Segment Performance
iPhone sales were down 16% year-over-year, but the company saw strong growth in Services, with a 20% increase in revenue. The App Store and Apple Music contributed significantly to this growth. However, Mac and iPad sales also declined, though the company believes it gained market share in some segments[5,.

## Inventory and ASPs
The planned reduction in channel inventory and the introduction of the iPhone SE are expected to impact ASPs and margins negatively. This could lead to a short-term negative perception on the company's ability to maintain its pricing power and profitability[5!.

## Market and Customer Dynamics
Despite the challenges, Apple remains optimistic about its future, highlighting strong customer loyalty, significant switcher activity from Android, and growth in emerging markets like India. However, the comparison to the exceptionally strong iPhone 6 cycle and current macroeconomic conditions continues to pose a challenge[5!.

## Capital Return Program
Apple announced an expansion of its capital return program to $250 billion, including a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend and an increased share repurchase authorization. This move is likely to be seen positively by investors who value income and capital returns[1][3][5!.

Given these points, here are the key implications for the stock price in the short term:

- **Negative Revenue Guidance**: The lower-than-expected revenue guidance and planned inventory reductions could lead to short-term market disappointment.
- **Segment Performance**: While Services growth is a positive, the decline in iPhone, Mac, and iPad sales could weigh on investor sentiment.
- **Optimistic Long-Term Outlook**: Apple's strong customer base, growth in emerging markets, and significant Services revenue growth could mitigate some of the short-term concerns.

**Conclusion:**
The combination of lower revenue guidance, inventory adjustments, and margin pressure due to the iPhone SE introduction, along with the overall decline in device sales, suggests a potentially negative short-term impact on the stock price. However, the company's strong Services segment and expanded capital return program could soften this impact.
