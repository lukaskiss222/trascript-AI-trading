The transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q4 2013 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Indicators
- Apple reported record fourth-quarter revenue of $37.5 billion and net income of $7.5 billion, exceeding the high end of their guidance range[1][4].
- Strong iPhone sales, with 33.8 million units sold, a 26% increase year-over-year, and robust growth in developing markets[1].
- The company launched several new products, including the iPhone 5s, iPhone 5c, iPad Air, and iPad Mini with Retina display, which are expected to drive sales in the holiday season[1].
- Apple's ecosystem and customer loyalty remain strong, with high customer satisfaction and retention rates for iPhones and iPads[1].

## Neutral to Negative Indicators
- Gross margin guidance for the December quarter is between 36.5% and 37.5%, which is impacted by higher revenue deferrals due to free software and services, a richer mix of new iPads, FX headwinds, and lower-priced MacBook Pro and iMac models[1].
- iPhone average selling prices (ASPs) were down 7% year-over-year due to increased sales of entry-level SKUs and FX headwinds[1].
- Supply constraints, particularly for the iPhone 5s and iPad Mini with Retina display, could impact sales in the short term[1].

## Guidance and Outlook
- Apple provided strong guidance for the December quarter, with expected revenue between $55 billion and $58 billion, which is slightly above the year-ago quarter[1].
- The company is confident in its product pipeline and continues to invest in R&D, distribution, and geographic expansion[1].

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong quarterly performance, robust product lineup, and optimistic guidance. However, the impact might be slightly tempered by the lower ASPs and supply constraints.
