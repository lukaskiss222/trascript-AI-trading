Apple's Q3 FY2014 earnings call presented several positive and some mixed signals that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Signals
- **Record Revenue and EPS**: Apple reported record June quarter revenue and a 20% year-over-year increase in EPS, indicating strong financial performance.
- **Strong iPhone and Mac Sales**: The company saw significant growth in iPhone and Mac sales, with iPhone sales up 13% and Mac sales up 18% year-over-year.
- **Expanding Ecosystem**: The App Store and other services continue to grow, with iTunes software and services revenue increasing by 12% year-over-year.
- **Strategic Partnerships**: The partnership with IBM and the acquisition of Beats Electronics are seen as strategic moves to expand into new markets, particularly the enterprise sector.
- **Innovative Products and Services**: The upcoming releases of OS X Yosemite, iOS 8, and the new programming language Swift are expected to enhance the Apple ecosystem.

### Mixed Signals
- **iPad Sales**: While iPad sales met expectations, they were lower than the previous year, affected by channel inventory reductions and market softness in certain regions.
- **Guidance**: The guidance for the September quarter includes a sequential decline in gross margin, which might be seen as a slight negative.
- **Market Challenges**: The impact of VAT increases and regulatory changes in Japan, as well as softer tablet markets in developed countries, are noted challenges.

### Conclusion
Given the overall strong financial performance, significant growth in key product categories, and strategic moves to expand the ecosystem, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive. However, the slight decline in gross margin guidance and challenges in certain markets might temper the enthusiasm slightly.
