Based on the transcript of Apple's Q1 2018 earnings call, here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

## Strong Financial Performance
- Apple reported its biggest quarter ever, with record revenue of $88.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.89, exceeding guidance and prior year records[2][5].
- Double-digit revenue growth in all geographic segments and a 21% increase in average revenue per week despite a shorter quarter[2][5].

## Product Performance
- iPhone X was the best-selling smartphone in the world, and iPhone revenue reached an all-time high. Despite a staggered launch, iPhone sales were strong across all regions[2][5].
- Other products like Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac also saw significant growth, with Apple Watch and wearables contributing substantially to revenue growth[2][5].

## Services and Ecosystem
- Services revenue hit an all-time high of $8.5 billion, up 18% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple Pay[2][5].
- The active installed base reached 1.3 billion devices, a 30% growth in two years, which fuels the services business[2][5].

## Guidance and Outlook
- Q2 2018 guidance indicates strong double-digit growth, with revenue expected between $60 billion and $62 billion. iPhone revenue is expected to grow double digits, and sell-through growth is anticipated to accelerate compared to the December quarter[2][5].

## Tax Reform and Capital Allocation
- The company expects to become approximately net cash neutral over time due to tax reform, which provides additional financial flexibility. This could lead to increased share buybacks, dividends, or strategic acquisitions[5].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is highly positive, reflecting strong performance across multiple product lines, services, and geographic regions. The guidance for the next quarter is also robust, indicating continued growth.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results, successful product launches, and optimistic guidance.
