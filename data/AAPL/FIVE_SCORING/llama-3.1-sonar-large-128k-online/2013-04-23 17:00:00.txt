Apple's Q2 2013 earnings call presented a mixed picture that is likely to have a positive but muted impact on the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Profit**: Apple reported record March quarter revenue of $43.6 billion and net profit of $9.5 billion, beating the high end of their guidance range. However, gross margins were at the low end of expectations at 37.5%, and there was a year-over-year decline in profit due to lower margins, particularly from the iPad mini[2][3][Transcript].

- **Product Sales**: Strong sales of iPhones (37.4 million) and iPads (19.5 million) were highlights, with significant growth in iPad sales. However, Mac sales were down 2% due to a weak PC market[Transcript].

- **Guidance**: The company provided conservative guidance for Q3, with expected revenue between $33.5 billion and $35.5 billion and a slight sequential decline in gross margins. This guidance might temper immediate investor enthusiasm[Transcript].

- **Capital Return Program**: Apple announced a significant increase in its capital return program to $100 billion by the end of 2015, including a $60 billion share buyback authorization and a 15% increase in the quarterly dividend. This move is likely to be viewed positively by investors[Transcript].

- **Management's Tone**: Tim Cook and Peter Oppenheimer expressed confidence in Apple's future product pipeline, ecosystem strength, and long-term growth prospects. However, they also acknowledged the challenges in the competitive landscape and the impact of product mix on margins[Transcript].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive but not extremely bullish reaction in the short term. The strong earnings and increased capital return program are positives, but the tempered guidance and margin pressures might limit the upside.
