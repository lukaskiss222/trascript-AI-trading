Based on the earnings transcript for Apple Inc., here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Revenue and EPS**: Apple reported revenue of $81.8 billion, down 1% year-over-year but better than expectations, and EPS of $1.26, up 5% year-over-year. Despite the slight revenue decline, the company's EPS growth and strong Services revenue are positive indicators[2].

2. **Services Revenue**: Apple set an all-time revenue record in Services, with an 8% year-over-year increase, driven by over 1 billion paid subscriptions. This segment's growth is a significant positive factor[2].

3. **Guidance**: The company provided guidance indicating similar year-over-year revenue performance in the September quarter, with expected acceleration in iPhone and Services revenue, but a decline in Mac and iPad revenue due to difficult comparisons[2].

4. **Geographic Performance**: Strong performance in emerging markets, including records in India, Greater China, and other regions, suggests robust global demand despite macroeconomic challenges[2].

5. **New Products and Innovations**: The introduction of Apple Vision Pro and other innovative products and software features is expected to drive future growth and excitement among investors and customers[2].

6. **Cost Management and Cash Flow**: Apple demonstrated strong cost management, with operating expenses below expectations, and generated significant operating cash flow, which is positive for shareholder returns[2].

Given these points, the overall tone of the earnings call is positive, especially considering the strong Services performance, innovative product pipeline, and effective cost management. However, the guidance for Mac and iPad revenue to decline due to difficult comparisons might introduce some caution.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong Services revenue, innovative product announcements, and robust cash flow, despite some caution around Mac and iPad sales.
