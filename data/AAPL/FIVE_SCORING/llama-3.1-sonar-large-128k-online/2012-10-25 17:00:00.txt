The earnings transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q4 2012 fiscal year presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors
- Apple reported strong revenue and net income, with $36 billion in revenue and $8.2 billion in net income, representing year-over-year growth of 27% and 24%, respectively[4].
- The company saw significant growth in iPhone and iPad sales, with 26.9 million iPhones and 14 million iPads sold, which are records for the September quarter[4].
- Apple introduced several new products, including the iPhone 5, iPad Mini, and new Mac models, which are expected to drive strong sales in the holiday quarter[4].
- The company has a strong cash position with $121.3 billion in cash and marketable securities and announced a dividend payment and a share repurchase program[4].

### Negative Factors
- The guidance for the December quarter indicates a potential decline in EPS year-over-year due to higher production costs associated with new product introductions and lower gross margins on products like the iPad Mini[4].
- Supply constraints, particularly for the iPhone 5 and iMac, could impact sales and revenue in the short term[4].
- The company faces competitive pressure from new tablet offerings, such as Microsoft's Surface, although Apple remains confident in its product lineup[4].

### Overall Impact
Given the strong product lineup, robust demand, and significant cash reserves, Apple is well-positioned for the holiday season. However, the guidance suggesting lower gross margins and potential supply constraints could introduce some short-term volatility.

### Conclusion
The stock is likely to experience a positive impact due to the strong earnings report, new product launches, and Apple's optimistic outlook for the holiday season, despite some near-term challenges.
