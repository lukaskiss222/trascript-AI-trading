Apple's Q1 2009 earnings call highlighted several key points that indicate a strong performance despite the challenging economic environment. Here are the main reasons for the short-term impact on the stock:

1. **Record Results**: Apple reported record revenue of $10.17 billion and a net quarterly profit of $1.61 billion, surpassing expectations and setting new records for iPod sales and overall earnings[1][3][4].

2. **Strong Product Performance**: The company saw significant growth in iPhone sales, with 4.4 million units sold, and strong sales of Macs, particularly in portables, despite a contracting global PC market. The iPod segment also performed well, with a new quarterly record of 22.7 million units sold[1].

3. **Positive Guidance**: Despite the economic uncertainty, Apple provided a relatively confident guidance for the March quarter, with revenue expected between $7.6 billion and $8 billion, and EPS in the range of $0.90 to $1.00. This suggests that the company is managing well through the economic challenges[1].

4. **Financial Health**: Apple's cash position improved significantly, with over $28 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities, indicating strong financial stability and flexibility[1].

5. **Competitive Advantage**: The executives emphasized Apple's competitive edge, particularly in software and the Apps Store, which continues to be a Differentiator. The company's commitment to innovation and its robust product pipeline were highlighted as key strengths[1].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong earnings, robust product sales, and confident guidance despite economic headwinds.
