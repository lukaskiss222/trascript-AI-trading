Apple's Q2 2007 earnings call presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Apple reported revenue and net income that exceeded guidance, with a 34% year-over-year revenue growth and a net profit of $770 million. This strong performance is likely to be positively received by investors[1][4][5].

2. **Transition to Intel**: The company is experiencing a pause in Mac demand due to the transition to Intel-based products, which is expected to continue into the June quarter. However, the transition progress and positive customer feedback on new Intel-based Macs suggest long-term benefits[1][4].

3. **iPod and Music Business**: The iPod business showed robust growth, with a 61% year-over-year increase in shipments, and the iTunes Music Store continued to expand its content and market share. These segments are crucial to Apple's revenue and are performing well[1][4].

4. **Guidance and Seasonality**: The guidance for the June quarter includes factors like lower ASPs due to the education buying season and the full-quarter impact of price reductions on iPod products. While this might suggest some near-term pressure, the overall guidance is still positive[1][4].

5. **Component Pricing and Margins**: Favorable component pricing, particularly for LCDs and NAND Flash, helped improve gross margins. This trend is expected to continue, which could support future profitability[1][4].

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance and continued growth in key segments like iPods and music are positive indicators.
- The temporary pause in Mac demand due to the Intel transition and seasonality factors might cause some short-term volatility but do not overshadow the long-term potential.
- Positive guidance and favorable component pricing environment further support a positive outlook.

### Conclusion
The overall tone of the earnings call is positive, with strong financial results, successful product transitions, and favorable market conditions. Therefore, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive.
