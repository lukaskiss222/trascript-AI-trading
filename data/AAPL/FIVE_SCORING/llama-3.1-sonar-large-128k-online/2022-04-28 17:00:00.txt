Based on the Apple Q2 FY2022 earnings conference call transcript, here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on Apple's stock price:

1. **Record Revenue and Earnings**: Apple reported a March quarter revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year, and earnings per share of $1.52, beating analyst expectations. This strong performance is typically positive for the stock[1][2][4].

2. **Supply Chain Constraints**: Despite the strong results, Apple highlighted significant supply chain constraints due to COVID-related disruptions and silicon shortages, which are expected to impact revenue in the June quarter by $4 billion to $8 billion. This could lead to some short-term volatility[4].

3. **Geographic Performance**: Apple saw strong growth in the Americas but more muted growth in Europe and China due to various factors including supply constraints and geopolitical issues. This mixed geographic performance might temper some of the optimism[4].

4. **Services Growth**: Apple's Services segment set an all-time revenue record, growing 17% year-over-year, which is a positive indicator for long-term growth but may see a deceleration in the June quarter due to external factors[4].

5. **Dividend and Share Buyback**: The company announced a 5% increase in dividend and an additional $90 billion for share repurchases, which generally supports shareholder value and can be seen as positive[1][2][4].

6. **Management's Tone**: Both Tim Cook and Luca Maestri expressed confidence in Apple's strategy, innovation, and future growth, despite acknowledging the challenges. This positive tone can reassure investors[4].

Given these points, the immediate reaction to the earnings report was positive, with Apple's stock rising over 2% post-announcement. However, the ongoing supply chain constraints and geopolitical uncertainties might introduce some caution.

### Conclusion
The strong financial performance, record revenue, and positive guidance on Services growth likely outweigh the short-term concerns about supply chain disruptions. Therefore, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
