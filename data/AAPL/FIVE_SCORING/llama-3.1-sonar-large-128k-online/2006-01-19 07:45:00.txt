The Q1 2006 financial results conference call for Apple Computer, Inc. presents several key points that could influence the short-term stock price:

1. **Record Revenue and Earnings**: Apple reported a strong quarter with record revenue of $5.75 billion and net income of $565 million, exceeding previous records and analyst expectations. This positive performance is likely to boost investor confidence[1].

2. **Intel Transition and Product Reception**: The transition to Intel-based Macs was well-received, with strong customer reactions to the new iMac and MacBook Pro announcements. However, there is a noted pause in Mac sales as customers awaited these new products, which could slightly temper short-term growth but is seen as a positive long-term indicator[1].

3. **iPod Sales and Margins**: iPod sales were exceptionally strong, with over 14 million units sold, and gross margins above 20%. This performance, combined with the growing ecosystem of iPod accessories, suggests continued strength in the music segment[1].

4. **Guidance and Seasonality**: The guidance for the March quarter, although lower than the record December quarter, still reflects significant year-over-year growth. The company expects a seasonal decline in iPod sales but remains optimistic about overall performance[1].

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, highlighting strong financial performance, successful product launches, and a robust outlook. However, the seasonal decline in iPod sales and the transition period for Mac products might introduce some short-term volatility.

**Conclusion**: The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial results and positive reception of new products, although some caution might be exercised due to seasonal factors and the transition period.
