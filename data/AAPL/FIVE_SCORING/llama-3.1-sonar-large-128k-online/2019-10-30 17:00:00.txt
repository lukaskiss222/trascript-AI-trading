Apple's Q4 FY2019 earnings call presented several positive and some cautionary notes that could influence the stock price in the short term:

### Positive Factors:
- **Record Revenue and Earnings**: Apple achieved its highest September quarter revenue ever at $64 billion, with a Q4 record EPS of $3.03 and operating cash flow of $19.9 billion[2][5].
- **Strong Services Growth**: Services revenue reached an all-time high of $12.5 billion, growing 18% year-over-year, driven by multiple services categories including the App Store, AppleCare, Music, and Payment Services[2][5].
- **Wearables and iPad Growth**: Wearables revenue set a Q4 record, growing 54% year-over-year, and iPad revenue increased by 17%[2][5].
- **Optimistic Outlook**: The company expressed confidence in the holiday quarter, fueled by strong customer response to new iPhone models, Apple TV+, and other services[2][5].

### Cautionary Notes:
- **iPhone Revenue Decline**: Although the decline in iPhone revenue improved to 9% from the previous quarter's 12% decline, it still represents a year-over-year decline[2][5].
- **Foreign Exchange Impact**: Foreign exchange negatively impacted revenue by almost $1 billion, and is expected to continue being a headwind in the upcoming quarter[2][5].
- **Tariff Uncertainty**: While the tone on trade tensions has improved, ongoing tariff uncertainties could still impact Apple's pricing and revenue[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive reaction in the short term due to the strong financial performance, growth in services and wearables, and optimistic guidance for the holiday quarter. However, the slight decline in iPhone revenue and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties might temper the enthusiasm slightly.
