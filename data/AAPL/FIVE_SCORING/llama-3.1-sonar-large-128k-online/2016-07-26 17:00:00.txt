Apple's Q3 2016 earnings call presented several positive and encouraging signs that are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Revenue and Gross Margin**: Apple reported revenue near the high end of their guidance range and a gross margin at the top of their guidance, indicating stronger customer demand and effective cost management.
- **Inventory Reduction**: The significant reduction in channel inventory, particularly for iPhones, positions the company well for the upcoming quarters and indicates healthier sell-through numbers.
- **iPhone SE Success**: The iPhone SE has been successful, attracting new customers and those preferring a smaller form factor, which is expected to continue contributing positively.
- **Services Growth**: The Services segment grew 19% to a record $6 billion, driven by the App Store, Music, iCloud, and AppleCare, which is a crucial and growing component of Apple's revenue.
- **Optimistic Guidance**: The guidance for the September quarter is robust, with revenue projected to be between $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion, which is historically strong.
- **Positive Signs in Emerging Markets**: Apple saw strong growth in several key markets, including India, Russia, and Brazil, which bodes well for future expansion.
- **Technological Advancements and Ecosystem Strength**: Apple's focus on AI, AR, and enhancing user experience across all its platforms is expected to drive continued innovation and customer loyalty.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
