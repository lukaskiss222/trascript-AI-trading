The earnings transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q3 FY2015 presents several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Strong Financial Performance
Apple reported record revenue of $49.6 billion and earnings of $10.7 billion, with a 33% year-over-year revenue growth and a 45% increase in earnings per share. This strong performance, despite challenging foreign exchange conditions and reduced channel inventories, is a positive indicator[1][3][5].

## iPhone and Mac Sales
iPhone unit sales grew 35% year-over-year, and Mac sales increased by 9%, defying the broader PC market contraction. These figures indicate robust demand for Apple's core products[1][3][5].

## Apple Watch and Services
Although specific Apple Watch sales figures were not disclosed, the company indicated that Watch sales exceeded expectations and had a higher sell-through rate than the original iPhone and iPad launches. The services segment, including the App Store, also saw significant growth, with a 24% increase in revenue[1][3][5].

## Guidance and Outlook
Apple provided guidance for the September quarter, estimating revenue between $49 billion and $51 billion, which is slightly above the year-ago quarter. The gross margin is expected to be between 38.5% and 39.5%, reflecting typical seasonal declines and foreign exchange impacts[1][3][5].

## Market and Geographic Performance
The company saw outstanding growth in Greater China, with revenue more than doubling year-over-year. This, combined with strong performance in other emerging markets, suggests continued global expansion and market share gains[1][3][5].

## Management's Tone
Tim Cook and Luca Maestri expressed confidence in Apple's future growth, highlighting the potential of new products, services, and geographic expansion. The tone was positive, emphasizing the company's ability to innovate and grow despite macroeconomic challenges[1][3][5].

Given these points, the overall sentiment from the earnings call is positive. The strong financial performance, robust product sales, and optimistic guidance suggest that Apple's stock is likely to experience a positive short-term impact.
