Based on the Q4 2005 earnings call transcript for Apple Inc., here are the key points that influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Revenue and Profit**: Apple reported revenue of $3.68 billion and a net quarterly profit of $430 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, which exceeded earnings estimates but fell short of revenue expectations[1][2].
- **Unit Sales**: The company saw significant growth in Mac shipments (48% year-over-year) and continued strong iPod sales, though iPod numbers were slightly below analyst expectations[1][2].
- **Guidance**: For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Apple provided guidance of $4.7 billion in revenue and GAAP earnings per diluted share of about $0.46, which was generally in line with expectations[1][2].
- **Market Reaction**: Despite the strong financial performance, Apple shares fell 11.8% in after-hours trading, likely due to the slight miss on revenue and lower-than-expected iPod sales[2].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely negative due to the initial market reaction to the slight miss on revenue and the lower-than-expected iPod sales.
