Apple’s Q3 2012 earnings call presented several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Sales but Mixed Guidance**: Apple reported record sales of iPads and iPhones, with a 23% year-over-year revenue increase. However, the guidance for the next quarter was slightly cautious, with expected revenue of $34 billion, which is a sequential decline, and a gross margin of 38.5%, down from the previous quarter[2][4].

2. **Economic and Speculation Factors**: The company noted that economic conditions in Europe and speculation about new products affected sales, particularly for iPhones. This speculation and economic uncertainty could continue to impact short-term sales[4].

3. **Channel Inventory and Product Transitions**: Apple ended the quarter with balanced channel inventories for iPhones and iPads but noted that the transition to new products and seasonal factors would impact the next quarter’s sales and margins[4].

4. **Geographical Performance**: While Apple saw strong growth in the U.S. and China, European sales were flat, and economic conditions in other regions like Australia, Brazil, and Canada impacted results. The stronger U.S. dollar also reduced revenue growth sequentially[4].

Given these points, the stock might face some short-term pressure due to the cautious guidance, economic uncertainties, and the impact of product speculation. However, Apple’s overall strong performance, innovative product pipeline, and continued dominance in key markets suggest that any downturn would be temporary.

**Rating: 0**
