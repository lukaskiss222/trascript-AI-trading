Apple's Q2 2017 earnings transcript indicates several positive factors that are likely to support the stock in the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Apple reported strong March quarter results, with revenue of $52.9 billion, gross margin at the high end of the guidance range, and earnings per share up 10% year-over-year.
- **Services Growth**: Services revenue reached a new record, growing 18% year-over-year, and the company is on track to double its Services business by 2020.
- **Product Demand**: iPhone 7 Plus demand was strong, Mac revenue grew 14%, and iPad sales were ahead of expectations. Apple Watch and AirPods sales also showed significant growth.
- **Geographic Performance**: Double-digit revenue growth in several key markets, including China, India, and other regions, suggests broad-based demand.
- **Capital Return Program**: The company increased its capital return program to $300 billion, extended through March 2019, which includes a higher share repurchase authorization and a dividend increase.
- **Positive Guidance**: The June quarter guidance, although reflecting some seasonal compression, remains strong, indicating continued confidence in future performance.

Given these robust results, the positive tone from management, and the supportive capital return program, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.
