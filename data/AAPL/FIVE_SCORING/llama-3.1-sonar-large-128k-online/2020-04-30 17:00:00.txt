The earnings transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q2 2020 fiscal year presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative elements that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors
- **Revenue Growth**: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Apple reported a 1% increase in revenue year-over-year, driven by an all-time record in Services ($13.3 billion) and a quarterly record for Wearables, Home, and Accessories ($6.3 billion)[3][4].
- **Strong Services Performance**: Apple's Services segment showed robust growth, with all-time records in many categories, and the company is on track to double its fiscal 2016 Services revenue by the end of 2020[3][4].
- **Resilient Supply Chain**: Apple's global supply chain demonstrated resilience and adaptability in the face of temporary supply constraints, and production was restored quickly[3][4].
- **Financial Strength**: Apple maintained a strong cash position, with $193 billion in cash plus marketable securities, and a net cash position of $83 billion. The company also announced a $50 billion share repurchase authorization and a 6% increase in the quarterly dividend[3][4].

### Negative Factors
- **Product Revenue Decline**: iPhone revenue declined 7% year-over-year due to COVID-19 impacts on supply and demand. Mac and iPad revenues also faced challenges, although there are signs of improvement expected in the June quarter[3][4].
- **Lack of Guidance**: Apple did not provide guidance for the next quarter due to uncertainties related to COVID-19, which could introduce volatility and uncertainty for investors[3][4].
- **Economic Headwinds**: The macroeconomic environment, including store closures and reduced consumer traffic, is expected to impact certain Services like AppleCare and advertising in the June quarter[3][4].

### Conclusion
Given the mixed performance and the lack of guidance for the upcoming quarter, the short-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The positive aspects, such as strong Services growth and a resilient supply chain, are somewhat offset by the decline in product revenue and the uncertain economic outlook.
