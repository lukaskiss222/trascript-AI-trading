Based on the earnings transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q4 2009, here are the key points that influence the short-term outlook for the stock:

## Strong Financial Performance
Apple reported its most profitable quarter ever, with revenue of $9.87 billion and net income of $1.67 billion, exceeding expectations and showcasing robust growth in Mac and iPhone sales.

## Record Sales and Market Share
The company achieved record sales of Macs and iPhones, with Mac sales growing 17% year-over-year and iPhone sales increasing by 7%. The iPhone 3GS demand exceeded expectations, and the company maintained a strong market share in both the Mac and iPhone segments.

## Positive Guidance
Apple provided strong guidance for the December quarter, anticipating revenue between $11.3 billion and $11.6 billion, which includes double-digit revenue growth from the previous year.

## Operational Highlights
- The company saw significant growth in international sales, particularly in Europe and Asia.
- The retail segment reported the highest revenue, segment margin, and Mac sales ever.
- Customer response to Snow Leopard and the new iPods was very positive.
- The iPhone's launch in China and expansion of carrier relationships were highlighted as significant opportunities.

## Challenging Factors
- Gross margins are expected to decline sequentially due to lower margins on new products, a higher mix of iPod sales, increased air freight costs, and higher component costs.
- There were supply constraints for the iPhone 3GS, but these were largely resolved by the end of the quarter.

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance, record sales, and positive guidance suggest a favorable short-term outlook.
- The company's ability to manage supply constraints and its robust product pipeline further support this positive view.
- However, the expected decline in gross margins and increased air freight costs are minor headwinds.

### Conclusion
The overall sentiment from the transcript is positive, indicating that Apple's stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
