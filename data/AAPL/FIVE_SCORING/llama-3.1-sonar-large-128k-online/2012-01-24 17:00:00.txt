The earnings transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q1 2012 fiscal year indicates several positive factors that suggest a strong short-term outlook for the stock:

1. **Record-Breaking Results**: Apple reported the highest quarterly revenue and earnings in its history, with $46.33 billion in revenue and $13.06 billion in net profit. This exceeded industry estimates and set new records for iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales[2][4].

2. **Strong Product Momentum**: The iPhone 4S saw tremendous success, with 37 million units sold, and the iPad also had a record quarter with 15.4 million units sold. Mac sales were up 26% year-over-year, outpacing the broader PC market[2][4].

3. **Robust Guidance**: Despite the expected sequential decline in revenue due to seasonal factors and the absence of the 14th week, Apple's guidance for the next quarter is still strong, with expected revenue of $32.5 billion and EPS of $8.50[2][4].

4. **Favorable Component Environment**: Apple expects favorable pricing trends for key components like NAND, DRAM, and LCDs, which will help maintain strong gross margins, although hard drive prices are expected to increase due to supply constraints[4].

5. **Cash Position and Strategic Use**: Appleâ€™s cash balance grew to $97.6 billion, and while there are no immediate announcements on uses such as dividends or buybacks, the company is actively discussing these options, which could potentially benefit shareholders[2][4].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong financial performance, robust product sales, and favorable guidance.
