The transcript for Apple Inc.'s fourth quarter financial results call indicates several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Strong Mac and iPod Sales**: Apple reported record Mac shipments and strong iPod sales, driven by successful product launches and back-to-school promotions. This positive performance is likely to be well-received by investors[4|.
- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company provided guidance for the December quarter, expecting revenue between $6 billion and $6.2 billion, which is generally in line with analyst expectations. However, the guidance did not exceed expectations significantly, and there are notes about potential economic slowdowns and component cost pressures[4|.
- **Inventory and Channel Management**: Inventory levels and channel management were managed well, with Mac channel inventory below the target range and iPod inventory within the target range. This suggests efficient supply chain management[4|.
- **International Performance**: Strong international sales and market share gains in key regions were highlighted, indicating continued global growth[4|.
- **Product Pipeline and Future Expectations**: There is enthusiasm about future product releases, including Leopard and other unnamed products, which could keep investor sentiment positive[4!.

Given these points, the overall tone of the call is positive, with strong current performance and a generally optimistic outlook. However, the guidance was not spectacularly above expectations, and there are some notes on economic and component cost uncertainties.

**Conclusion**: The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong quarterly performance, successful product launches, and optimistic future expectations.
