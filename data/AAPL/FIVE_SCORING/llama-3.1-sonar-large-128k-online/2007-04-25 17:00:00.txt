Based on the Q3 2024 earnings call transcript for Apple Inc., here are the key points that could influence the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

### Positive Factors
- Apple reported a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, and a record EPS of $1.40, which is a positive indicator of the company's financial health[1][3][4].
- Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year, which is a significant contributor to Apple's revenue and profitability[1][3].
- The company set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, indicating strong global performance[1][3].
- Apple’s active installed base of devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, reflecting high customer satisfaction and loyalty[1][4].

### Mixed and Potentially Negative Factors
- iPhone revenue was down 1% year-over-year, although it grew on a constant currency basis. This slight decline could raise some concerns about iPhone sales momentum[1][3].
- Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was down 2% year-over-year, which might indicate some softness in these segments[1][3].
- Gross margin was 46.3%, down 30 basis points sequentially, due to a different mix within products and some unfavorable foreign exchange impacts[1][3].

### Guidance and Outlook
- For the September quarter, Apple expects total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter, and services revenue to grow double digits. The gross margin is expected to be between 45.5% and 46.5%, which is in line with previous guidance[1][3].

Given these points, here is the likely short-term impact on Apple’s stock price:

- The strong revenue and EPS records, combined with the robust services segment and expanding global reach, are likely to support the stock price.
- However, the slight declines in iPhone and Wearables revenue might introduce some cautious sentiment.

Overall, the positive factors are likely to dominate the short-term outlook, suggesting a neutral to positive impact on the stock price.
