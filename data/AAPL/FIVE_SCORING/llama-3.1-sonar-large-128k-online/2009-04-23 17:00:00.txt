The transcript of Apple's Q2 2009 earnings call presents several key points that suggest a positive short-term outlook for the company's stock:

- **Record Revenue and Earnings**: Apple reported its best non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings in history, with $8.16 billion in revenue and $1.21 billion in net income, exceeding expectations[2][3][4].
- **Strong Product Performance**: The company saw significant growth in iPhone sales (123% year-over-year) and robust sales of iPods, particularly the iPod Touch. The App Store continued to be a major success, nearing 1 billion downloads[2][3][4].
- **Optimistic Guidance**: Despite the economic challenges, Apple provided guidance for the June quarter that indicated year-over-year growth, albeit with a sequential decline due to factors like delayed iPhone revenue recognition and the impact of the stronger US dollar[2][4].
- **Financial Health**: Apple's financial condition remains robust, with nearly $29 billion in cash and marketable securities, and disciplined inventory management contributing to higher gross margins[2][3][4].
- **Positive Management Tone**: Executives expressed enthusiasm about upcoming products, particularly the iPhone OS 3.0, and confidence in their strategy and product pipeline[2][3].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
