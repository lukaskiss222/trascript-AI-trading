Apple's Q3 FY2017 earnings call revealed several positive indicators that suggest a strong short-term outlook for the company's stock. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Earnings Growth**: Apple reported a 7% year-over-year revenue growth and a 17% increase in earnings per share, both at the high end of their guidance range. This acceleration in growth rate is a positive sign[1][3][5].
- **Strong Product Performance**: iPhone sales were strong, especially at the high end, with iPhone 7 Plus sales up dramatically. iPad and Mac sales also grew significantly, with iPad sales up 15% and Mac revenue up 7% year-over-year[1][3][5].
- **Services Segment**: The Services segment set an all-time quarterly record with 22% year-over-year growth, driven by the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. This segment continues to show robust growth and is becoming a significant contributor to Apple's revenue[1][3][5].
- **Guidance**: The guidance for the fourth quarter is strong, with revenue expected to be between $49 billion and $52 billion, which is higher than the previous quarter's revenue. This suggests continued momentum into the next quarter[1][3][5].
- **Innovations and Future Products**: Apple highlighted several upcoming innovations, including iOS 11, macOS High Sierra, watchOS4, and the introduction of ARKit, which are expected to drive customer interest and sales in the coming months[1][3].

Given these positive factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
