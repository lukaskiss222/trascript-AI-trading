The transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q3 2007 earnings call indicates several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Financial Performance**: Apple reported record June quarter revenue and profit, driven by strong Mac and iPod sales. This positive performance is likely to be well-received by investors[2][3].

2. **iPhone Launch**: Despite initial sales of only 270,000 iPhones, the company expressed confidence in the product's long-term potential, with a goal to sell 10 million iPhones in 2008. The positive customer satisfaction reports and plans for European and Asian market expansion are promising signs[2][3].

3. **Guidance**: The company provided guidance for the September quarter, which includes a lower gross margin expectation due to back-to-school promotions, higher commodity costs, and product transitions. This could temper some of the enthusiasm from the strong Q3 results[2].

4. **Component Costs and Supply**: Apple noted favorable commodity costs in Q3 but anticipated tighter supply conditions in the second half of the year, particularly for NAND flash and LCDs. This could pose some risk to margins and supply chain stability[2].

Given these points:

- The strong financial performance and record-breaking sales are positive indicators.
- The lower gross margin guidance and potential component cost increases could introduce some caution.
- However, the overall tone from management remains optimistic, especially regarding the iPhone's long-term potential.

Considering these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term, although the guidance on lower margins might slightly temper the enthusiasm.
