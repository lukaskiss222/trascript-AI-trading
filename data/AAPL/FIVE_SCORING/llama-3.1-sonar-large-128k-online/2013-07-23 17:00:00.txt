The transcript for Apple Inc.'s Q3 2013 earnings call presents several key points that can influence the short-term impact on the stock price:

1. **Record iPhone Sales**: Apple reported a record 31.2 million iPhone sales for the June quarter, a 20% increase year-over-year, which is a positive indicator[5）。
2. **Gross Margin and Revenue**: The company achieved revenue of $35.3 billion and a gross margin of 36.9%, which is at the high end of their guidance range. However, the gross margin was down sequentially due to lower revenue leverage and product mix changes[5].
3. **iPad and Mac Sales**: iPad sales were down year-over-year due to channel inventory changes, but Mac sales were higher than expected despite a decline. This mixed performance might not significantly impact the stock positively[5].
4. **Guidance and Future Products**: Apple provided guidance for the next quarter with revenue expected between $34 billion and $37 billion and gross margin between 36% and 37%. The company also hinted at new products and services to be released in the fall, which could generate investor excitement[5].
5. **Financial Health and Share Buybacks**: Apple's strong cash position and active share buyback program are positive factors. The company concluded a $1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program and executed a $17 billion debt offering, indicating a robust financial position[5].

### Conclusion

Given these points, the stock is likely to see a positive but not overly enthusiastic reaction. The record iPhone sales and strong financial position are positives, but the sequential decline in gross margin and mixed performance in other product categories might temper some of the excitement.
