Apple's Q1 earnings call revealed strong financial results, with record revenue and net income. The company's iPod and Mac sales drove the revenue growth, with iPod sales reaching 21.1 million units and Mac shipments totaling 1.61 million units. The gross margin was exceptionally high at 31.2%, benefiting from a favorable commodity pricing environment, better product mix, and greater leverage of fixed costs. Management expressed confidence in the company's future prospects, citing the upcoming release of the iPhone and Apple TV. Despite the positive results, the guidance for the March quarter was somewhat conservative, which may have tempered investor enthusiasm. Overall, the strong earnings report and promising product pipeline suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
