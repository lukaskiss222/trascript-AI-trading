Apple's record-breaking earnings call revealed strong growth across all product lines, with iPhone, iPad, and Mac sales exceeding expectations. The company's expansion into new markets, particularly in Asia, and the introduction of the Mac App Store and iPad have contributed to its success. While there may be some cannibalization of Mac sales by iPads, Apple's overall product ecosystem and loyal customer base position the company for continued growth.
