Apple's Q3 earnings call revealed record quarterly revenue and earnings, driven by strong iPhone and iPad sales. The company's guidance for the September quarter was conservative, possibly due to the upcoming product transition and the impact of iCloud and iOS 5. Despite this, management expressed confidence in Apple's business, new product pipeline, and momentum. The stock is likely to experience short-term upward pressure due to the strong earnings and the anticipation of new product launches.
