Apple's Q3 earnings call revealed strong sales of iPhones and iPads, with the company achieving record quarterly revenue and earnings. However, the guidance for the September quarter was somewhat cautious, with the company citing a stronger US dollar, economic uncertainty in Europe, and rumors of new products potentially affecting sales. Given the mixed signals, the stock is likely to experience a neutral impact in the short term, as the company's long-term prospects and product pipeline remain strong, but near-term uncertainties may limit upside.
