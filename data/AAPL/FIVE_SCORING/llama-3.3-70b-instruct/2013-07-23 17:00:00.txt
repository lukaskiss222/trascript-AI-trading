Apple's Q3 earnings call revealed strong iPhone sales, with 31.2 million units sold, exceeding expectations. However, iPad sales were down due to a tough year-over-year comparison and channel inventory changes. The company's guidance for Q4 was generally in line with expectations, with revenue projected to be between $34 billion and $37 billion. Management's tone was positive, with a focus on upcoming product releases and the continued strength of the Apple ecosystem. Overall, the call suggested a neutral short-term outlook for the stock.
