Apple's Q1 FY09 earnings call revealed strong results, with record quarterly revenue and earnings. The company's guidance for the March quarter was moderately positive, with expected revenue growth. However, management's tone was cautious due to economic uncertainty. The iPhone and iPod segments performed well, while Mac sales were slightly weaker than expected. Given the solid results and moderate guidance, the stock is likely to experience a short-term positive impact.
