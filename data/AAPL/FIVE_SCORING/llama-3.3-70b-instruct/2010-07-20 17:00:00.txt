Apple's Q3 earnings call revealed a strong quarter with record revenue and profits, driven by the successful launch of the iPhone 4 and iPad. The company's guidance for the September quarter was also strong, with expected revenue of $18 billion. While there are some concerns about supply chain constraints and potential cannibalization of Mac sales by the iPad, management's tone was optimistic and confident in the company's ability to execute. The stock is likely to react positively to the strong earnings and guidance, and the company's continued innovation and dominance in the mobile device market.
