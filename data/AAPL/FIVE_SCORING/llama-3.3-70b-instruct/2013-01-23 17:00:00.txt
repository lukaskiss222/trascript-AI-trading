Apple's Q1 earnings report showed record iPhone and iPad sales, with revenue reaching $54.5 billion, surpassing expectations. The company's strong performance was driven by the popularity of the iPhone 5 and the iPad mini, with iPhone sales growing 78% sequentially and iPad sales growing 60% year-over-year. The company's gross margin was 38.6%, higher than expected, due to lower product costs and a higher mix of iPhone sales. Management's tone was positive, with Tim Cook expressing confidence in the company's new product pipeline and the opportunity for growth in the tablet market.
