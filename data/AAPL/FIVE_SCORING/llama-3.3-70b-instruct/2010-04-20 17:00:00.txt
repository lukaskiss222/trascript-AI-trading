Apple's Q2 FY10 earnings call revealed outstanding results, exceeding expectations with record quarterly revenue and earnings. The company's strong performance was driven by the iPhone, Mac, and iPad, with iPhone sales more than doubling year-over-year and Mac sales growing 33%. The iPad's launch was highly successful, with customer response exceeding expectations. Management's tone was optimistic, with a focus on product innovation, expansion into new markets, and strategic investments. Given the strong results and positive guidance, I predict a short-term positive impact on the stock price.
