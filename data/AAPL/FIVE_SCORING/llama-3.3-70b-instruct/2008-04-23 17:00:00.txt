Apple's Q2 2008 earnings call revealed strong performance, with record Mac sales and robust iPhone demand. The company's revenue growth accelerated to 43% year-over-year, driven by Mac sales, higher iPod revenue, and iPhone momentum. Despite a delay in revenue recognition for iPhones sold after March 6th due to the upcoming iPhone 2.0 software release, Apple's guidance for the June quarter remains strong, with revenue expected to grow 33% year-over-year. The company's ability to maintain its momentum in the face of economic uncertainty and its plans for international expansion and new product releases suggest a positive outlook for the stock in the short term.
