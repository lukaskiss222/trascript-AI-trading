Apple's Q3 earnings call revealed strong revenue growth, driven by robust Mac sales and continued demand for iPods. The company reported $4.37 billion in revenue, representing 24% year-over-year growth, with Mac sales increasing 12% year-over-year. Although the guidance for the September quarter was consistent with historical seasonality, the company's gross margin guidance was lower than expected, due to a full quarter impact of the back-to-school promotion and a different product mix. Overall, Apple's financials and management's tone suggest a positive outlook, but the lowered guidance may lead to short-term pressure on the stock.
