Apple's Q2 earnings call revealed a strong quarter with revenue exceeding guidance, driven by continued growth in the music business and solid performance in the Mac business despite a pause in demand due to the Intel transition. The company reported a gross margin of 29.8% and net income of $410 million, with iPod shipments growing 61% year over year. However, management's guidance for the June quarter was cautious, citing a continued pause in Mac demand and lower ASPs due to the education buying season. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key product transitions.
