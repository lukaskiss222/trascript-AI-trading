Apple's Q4 earnings call revealed a strong quarter with record iPhone and iPad sales, driven by the launch of new products such as the iPhone 5 and iPad Mini. Despite facing supply chain constraints and increased competition, the company remains confident in its product lineup and sees significant opportunities for growth in the holiday season. The guidance for the December quarter indicates a sequential increase in revenue, driven by the new products, but also reflects a decline in gross margin due to higher costs associated with the new products and aggressive pricing of the iPad Mini.
