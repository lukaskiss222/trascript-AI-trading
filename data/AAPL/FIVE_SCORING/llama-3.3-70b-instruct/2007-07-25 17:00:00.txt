Apple's Q3 earnings call revealed strong financial results, with record Mac sales and high customer satisfaction with the newly launched iPhone. The company's guidance for the September quarter was conservative, with a expected decline in gross margin due to the back-to-school promotion, higher commodity costs, and product transitions. Despite this, the iPhone's potential for long-term growth and the company's increasing market share in the Mac business are positives. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short-term due to the company's strong performance and growth prospects.
