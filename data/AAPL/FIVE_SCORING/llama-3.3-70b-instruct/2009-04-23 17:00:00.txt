Apple's Q2 FY09 earnings call revealed strong quarterly results, exceeding expectations despite a challenging economic environment. The company reported a record non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings, with significant growth in iPhone sales and a strong performance from the App Store. Management expressed enthusiasm for the upcoming iPhone OS 3.0 release and confidence in the company's ability to maintain its competitive edge in the smartphone market. However, the guidance for the June quarter was somewhat cautious, with a projected sequential revenue decline.
