Apple's strong quarterly results, with record Mac sales and a successful iPhone 3G launch, indicate a positive trend for the company. The guidance for the September quarter, although conservative, still shows revenue growth of 25% year-over-year. Management's confidence in the iPhone's potential and the App Store's success, along with the company's continued focus on innovation and customer experience, support a bullish outlook. However, the lower gross margin guidance for fiscal 2009 and potential concerns about the global economy may temper enthusiasm. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
