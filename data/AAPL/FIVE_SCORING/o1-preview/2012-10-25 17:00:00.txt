Apple reported strong revenue growth and record sales in Q4, with significant increases in iPhone and iPad units sold. However, the company's guidance for Q1 projects lower gross margins and EPS due to higher costs from new product launches and aggressive pricing strategies, which may concern investors in the short term. Additionally, ongoing supply constraints for key products like the iPhone 5 could contribute to negative sentiment.
