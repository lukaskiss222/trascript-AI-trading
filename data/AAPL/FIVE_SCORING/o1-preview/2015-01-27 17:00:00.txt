Apple reported record-breaking quarterly results, with revenue up 30% year-over-year and iPhone sales growing 46%, significantly surpassing expectations. Strong demand for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, particularly in emerging markets like China, and positive developments in services and new products, like Apple Pay and the upcoming Apple Watch, suggest continued momentum. Despite some concerns about foreign exchange headwinds and a decline in iPad sales, the company's robust performance and optimistic outlook are likely to drive the stock higher in the short term.
