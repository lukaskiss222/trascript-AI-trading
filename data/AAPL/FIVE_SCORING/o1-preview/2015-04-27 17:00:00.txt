Apple reported record-breaking quarterly results, with substantial revenue and earnings growth driven by strong iPhone sales, especially in emerging markets. The company announced an expansion of its capital return program to $200 billion, increased dividends, and provided strong guidance for the next quarter. Positive management tone, impressive performance across product lines, and the successful launch of new products like Apple Watch suggest the stock will rally in the short term.
