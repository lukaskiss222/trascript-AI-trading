Apple reported strong Q4 results, with record revenue of $37.5 billion and iPhone sales up 26% year-over-year, exceeding expectations. The launch of new products like the iPhone 5s and 5c, iPad Air, and iPad Mini with Retina display, coupled with positive guidance for the next quarter, signals continued growth and strong consumer demand. Despite some concerns over gross margins and average selling prices, the company's optimistic outlook and robust performance are likely to positively influence the stock price in the short term.
