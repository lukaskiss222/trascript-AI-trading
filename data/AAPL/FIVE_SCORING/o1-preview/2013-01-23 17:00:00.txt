Apple reported record quarterly revenue and net income, driven by strong iPhone and iPad sales, especially in Greater China. However, guidance for the next quarter indicates slower revenue growth of 5-10%, lower gross margins, and expectations of decreased iPad average selling prices due to product mix. These factors, along with supply constraints and declining Mac and iPod sales, may lead to short-term negative sentiment among investors.
