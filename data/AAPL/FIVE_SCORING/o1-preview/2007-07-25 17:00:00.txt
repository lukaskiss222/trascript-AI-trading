Apple reported strong Q3 results with record revenue and Mac sales, but issued lower-than-expected guidance for Q4, citing reduced gross margins due to product transitions, higher commodity costs, and promotional expenses. Management's limited disclosure on future product plans and the significant drop in gross margin guidance may cause short-term investor concern. Therefore, the stock price is likely to face negative pressure in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
