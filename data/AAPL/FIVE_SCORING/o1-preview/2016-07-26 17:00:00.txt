Apple reported quarterly results that surpassed guidance expectations, with strong performance in Services (up 19%) and promising growth in emerging markets like India. Despite a year-over-year decline in revenue and iPhone sales, management expressed optimism for the future, citing the successful launch of the iPhone SE, increased switcher rates, and positive outlook in China and India. Improved guidance for the next quarter and a focus on growing their Services business suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
