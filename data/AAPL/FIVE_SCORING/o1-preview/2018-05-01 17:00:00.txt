Apple reported strong financial results for Q2, with revenue up 16% and EPS up 30% year-over-year, setting new records. Significant growth in services (up 31%) and wearables (up almost 50%), along with a positive response to the iPhone X and a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization, signal robust performance and confidence from management. These factors, combined with optimistic guidance, are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
