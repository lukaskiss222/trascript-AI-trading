Apple's earnings call showcased strong quarterly results with revenue reaching $52.9 billion near the high end of guidance, and accelerating growth. The company highlighted robust demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, significant growth in Services revenue (up 18% year over year), and nearly doubled Apple Watch sales, contributing to positive momentum across key product lines. Additionally, the increased capital return program by $50 billion and a dividend raise are likely to boost investor confidence in the short term.
