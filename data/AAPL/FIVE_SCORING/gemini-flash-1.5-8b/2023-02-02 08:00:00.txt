Apple's Q1 2023 earnings call highlighted a mixed picture.  While exceeding expectations in Services and achieving record revenue in several key markets, the company reported a 5% year-over-year revenue decline, primarily due to foreign exchange headwinds and supply chain issues.  Management's cautious outlook, absence of revenue guidance for Q2, and commentary on a challenging macroeconomic environment suggest the stock may face short-term pressure, however the strength of the services division and overall installed base may offer support.
