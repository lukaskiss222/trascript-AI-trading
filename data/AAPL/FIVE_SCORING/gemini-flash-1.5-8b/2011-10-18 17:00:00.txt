Apple's strong Q4 earnings, driven by record Mac and iPad sales and a new iPhone sales record, suggest a positive short-term outlook.  Management's confidence in the iPhone 4S launch and continued strong demand for iPads point to potential for further stock price gains.  The successful early sales of iPhone 4S, exceeding initial expectations, significantly contributes to the positive outlook.
