Apple's earnings call highlights a challenging but resilient response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  While product revenue declined due to supply chain disruptions and reduced demand, particularly in the final weeks of the quarter, strong growth in Services revenue partially offset the impact.  Management emphasized a focus on long-term strategy and innovation, with no guidance provided for the June quarter due to the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic's effect. The stock price is likely to be impacted negatively in the near term due to continued uncertainty and a likely further decline in future quarters.
