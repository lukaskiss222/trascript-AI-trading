Apple's earnings call indicates strong performance despite the economic downturn.  Record revenue and earnings, exceeding expectations, are a positive sign.  However, the guidance for the June quarter reflects cautious optimism, with revenue anticipated to be lower due to delayed iPhone OS 3.0 revenue recognition and  potential economic headwinds impacting professional and educational markets.  This suggests a potentially more subdued stock price reaction in the near term.
