Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations, with record revenue and strong performance in key segments like Mac and Services.   However, management's cautious outlook, noting a deceleration in December quarter performance due to FX headwinds and a challenging year-over-year comparison, particularly on Mac, suggests a potential short-term impact on the stock price.  The focus on growing emerging markets and sustaining high customer satisfaction is not enough to overcome the macroeconomic pressures.
