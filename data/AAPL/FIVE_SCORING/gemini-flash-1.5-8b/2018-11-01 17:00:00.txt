Apple's Q4 2018 earnings call showcased strong results, exceeding expectations on revenue and earnings per share.  Management emphasized record performance across product segments, particularly in iPhones, services, and wearables, driven by the successful launches of the new XS and XS Max models.  The call also highlights a shift in reporting, declining to disclose unit sales figures, indicating a focus on overall financial performance rather than individual unit counts.
