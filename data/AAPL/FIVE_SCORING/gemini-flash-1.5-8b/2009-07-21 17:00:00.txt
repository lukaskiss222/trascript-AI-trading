Apple's earnings call highlights strong performance, particularly with the iPhone 3GS, exceeding sales targets.  Management emphasized continued growth in Mac and iPhone sales,  despite a challenging economic climate.  The updated guidance indicates a slightly slower sequential growth projection for the next quarter but is still positive.  This suggests a likely positive impact on the stock price in the next 1-2 weeks, driven by the strength of the results and positive management commentary.
