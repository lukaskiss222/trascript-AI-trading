Apple's earnings call highlights strong Q4 FY2015 results, exceeding expectations with record revenue and earnings.  Management emphasized continued strong growth in emerging markets, particularly Greater China, and significant momentum for iPhone upgrades.  While guidance suggests slightly lower growth in the following quarter, comments regarding ongoing market demand, especially for new iPhones and Appleâ€™s increased focus on services bolster confidence and indicate a likely positive short-term impact on the stock price.
