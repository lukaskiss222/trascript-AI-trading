Apple's Q2 2023 earnings show strong Services revenue and iPhone records, but overall revenue is down 3% YoY due to FX headwinds.  While the company performed better than expected and highlighted growth in emerging markets, the guidance for the June quarter suggests revenue will be similar to Q1, indicating a flat to slightly negative year-over-year trend.  This is likely to put downward pressure on the stock price over the next few weeks, though the strong Services performance may moderate any significant decline.
