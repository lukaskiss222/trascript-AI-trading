Apple's Q3 earnings exceeded expectations, with record revenue and EPS.  Strong services revenue growth, particularly in advertising, cloud, and payment, and positive commentary on Apple Intelligence and Vision Pro, point to a bullish near-term outlook. While iPhone sales were slightly down, the company highlighted record installed base and positive upgrade trends, mitigating the concern.  Overall, the positive earnings report and management's upbeat tone suggest a likely stock price rally over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
