Apple's earnings call highlights strong sales and record revenue, exceeding expectations for the September quarter.  Management emphasizes the strength of their ecosystem and positive reception to new products like the iPhone 5s and iPad Air.  However, downward pressure on iPhone ASPs due to lower-priced models and FX factors is acknowledged, albeit offset by strong demand in developing markets.  This suggests moderate positive short-term impact with the potential of investors feeling validated by robust financial figures despite some external headwinds.
