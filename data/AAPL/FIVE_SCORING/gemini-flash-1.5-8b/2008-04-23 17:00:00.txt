Apple's earnings call highlights strong performance, exceeding expectations in revenue and earnings.  Management emphasized the continued strong demand for Macs, iPods, and iPhones, particularly the Macbook Air.  Guidance for the next quarter projects 33% revenue growth, implying a positive outlook despite deferring iPhone 2.0 revenue recognition.  The short-term impact is likely positive from the upbeat results, but the deferral of iPhone revenue may introduce some short-term uncertainty for investors who track revenue recognition closely.
