Apple's Q3 FY19 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by strong growth in Wearables and Services, and a significant improvement in iPhone performance compared to Q2.  Management's tone is highly optimistic, forecasting continued growth and highlighting successful initiatives like the trade-in program.  The positive guidance and upbeat outlook for new services, like Apple Arcade and Apple TV+, should inspire investor confidence leading to a likely short-term rally in the stock price.
