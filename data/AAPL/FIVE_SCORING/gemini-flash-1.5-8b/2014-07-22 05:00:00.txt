Apple's Q3 2014 earnings call highlighted strong iPhone and Mac sales, exceeding expectations despite a shrinking PC market.  The company's upbeat tone and focus on the growing iOS ecosystem, new features like CarPlay and HealthKit, and the large-scale enterprise partnerships, including with IBM, suggest potential for continued growth.  Concerns around iPad sales being lower than anticipated will likely be the primary factor influencing the stock in the near term.
