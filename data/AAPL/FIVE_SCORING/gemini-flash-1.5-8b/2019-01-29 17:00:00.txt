Apple's Q1 2019 earnings call reveals a mixed outlook, with revenue below expectations primarily due to weaker-than-anticipated iPhone upgrades, particularly in Greater China.  While Services and other product segments saw strong growth, the management team emphasizes macroeconomic uncertainties and foreign exchange headwinds as key factors influencing iPhone sales.  Short-term implications include potential pressure on the stock price due to the lowered guidance and concerns over the impact of macroeconomic factors, but management's focus on services growth and a strong installed base suggests overall potential for long-term growth.
