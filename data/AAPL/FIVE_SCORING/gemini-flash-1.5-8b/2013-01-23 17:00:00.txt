Apple's earnings call highlighted record iPhone and iPad sales, exceeding expectations.  Management noted strong iPhone and iPad growth, particularly in Greater China, driven by iPhone 5 popularity and successful iPad mini launch.  However, the guidance for the upcoming March quarter reflects a more moderate, 5% to 10% year-over-year revenue increase, possibly due to reduced iPhone ASPs from the introduction of the iPad mini and lower PC market growth.
