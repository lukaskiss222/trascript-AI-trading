Apple's earnings call signals strong short-term performance for iPad and a likely slight decrease in iPhone sales due to increased inventory in the March quarter. Management's confidence in future product pipeline and the company's long-term strategy suggests a stable outlook.  The likely impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks is a positive one based on the positive reception of the new iPad and strong financial results.
