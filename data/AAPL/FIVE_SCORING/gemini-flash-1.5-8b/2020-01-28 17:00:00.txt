Apple's Q1 2020 earnings were significantly positive, exceeding expectations with record revenue and earnings.  Management highlighted strong performance across all product segments and geographies, particularly in services, Wearables, and iPhone.  However, the company acknowledged concerns about supply constraints on certain models and the evolving situation surrounding the coronavirus outbreak in China, both of which resulted in a wider-than-usual revenue range and a notable headwind for Japan.  The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be strongly positive due to the positive earnings surprise, but tempered somewhat by the external China-related uncertainties and challenges in the Japanese market.
