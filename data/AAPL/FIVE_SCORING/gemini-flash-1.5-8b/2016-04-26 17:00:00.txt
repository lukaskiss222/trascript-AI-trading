Apple's Q2 2016 earnings call revealed a slowdown in revenue growth, primarily due to currency headwinds and tough year-over-year comparisons, but strong Services performance and continued customer loyalty.  The company's guidance anticipates a sequential revenue decline and a dip in iPhone ASPs as the iPhone SE models, offering a lower-cost entry point, enter the mix. Management's focus on capital return – including a significant increase to the company's share repurchase authorization – along with continued optimism on new markets like India, suggests a potentially positive outlook despite short-term headwinds.
