Apple's earnings call highlighted record iPhone and Mac sales, exceeding expectations significantly.  Strong international growth, particularly in Asia, fueled this success. However, the company is guiding for lower revenue and gross margins in the next quarter, attributed to the iPad's impact on gross margin, a stronger dollar, and the education buying season.  Management's confidence in the iPad's market potential and their aggressive pricing strategy suggests a short-term focus on market share gains over higher margins.
