Honeywell reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, with sales at the high end of guidance, higher EPS, strong free cash flow, and raised full-year earnings and cash flow estimates. The company highlighted stabilization in end markets, growth in orders across all businesses, and significant improvements in early-cycle segments. These positive results and optimistic outlook are likely to boost investor confidence and have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
