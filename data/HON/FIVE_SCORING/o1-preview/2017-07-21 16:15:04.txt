Honeywell International reported strong Q2 results, exceeding sales and earnings expectations, and raised the low end of its full-year guidance. The company demonstrated solid organic growth across all business segments, expanded margins, and showed positive cash flow momentum. The positive outlook and management's confidence suggest a favorable short-term impact on the stock price.
