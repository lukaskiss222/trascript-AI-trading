Honeywell reported strong Q4 and full-year 2018 results, exceeding financial commitments and demonstrating robust growth, especially in aerospace and defense. Management expressed confidence in achieving solid organic growth and margin expansion in 2019, despite macroeconomic uncertainties, and does not anticipate material impacts from tariffs. The positive outlook and continued operational excellence suggest a likely positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
