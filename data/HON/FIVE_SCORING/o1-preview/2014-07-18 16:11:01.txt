Honeywell reported strong Q2 results exceeding expectations, with double-digit EPS growth and margin expansion across all segments. The company raised the low end of its full-year EPS guidance and expressed confidence in continued outperformance, highlighting robust orders and backlog, especially in key areas like UOP and Aerospace. Management's positive tone and the acceleration in organic sales growth suggest the stock is likely to rally in the short term.
