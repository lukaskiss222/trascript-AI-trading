Honeywell delivered strong fourth-quarter and full-year results, exceeding expectations with 6% organic sales growth and margin expansion. The company raised its 2018 EPS guidance due to tax reform benefits and strong operational performance, anticipating continued growth supported by robust order rates and backlogs. This optimistic outlook and positive financial performance are likely to have a great positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
