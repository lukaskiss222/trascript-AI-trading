Honeywell delivered Q1 results in line with guidance but significantly lowered their full-year EPS outlook due to tougher-than-expected market conditions, especially in commercial aerospace and transportation. Management's acknowledgment of the deteriorating environment and the reduction in guidance is likely to weigh on the stock in the short term, despite ongoing cost-cutting measures and investments in long-term growth. The stock is expected to face negative pressure due to the reduced earnings expectations.
