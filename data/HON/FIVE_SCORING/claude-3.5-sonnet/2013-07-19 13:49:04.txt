Based on my analysis of this earnings call transcript, Honeywell demonstrated solid execution despite a challenging macro environment. Key positives include:

- Strong margin expansion driven by productivity initiatives and restructuring benefits
- Encouraging signs in short-cycle businesses and China growth rebounding to 14% 
- Raised full-year EPS guidance range, indicating confidence in outlook
- Healthy aerospace commercial aftermarket trends with improving flight hours
- Continued investments in growth initiatives and new product development

However, some headwinds remain:

- Defense/Space sales declining due to sequestration impacts
- Some uncertainty around European markets despite recent stabilization
- PMT margins impacted by lower UOP licensing vs prior year

Given management's confident tone about execution capabilities, strategic investments for growth, and raising guidance despite macro challenges, I expect a positive short-term stock reaction.
