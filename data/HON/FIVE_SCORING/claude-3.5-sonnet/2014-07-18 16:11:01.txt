Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive but moderate impact on Honeywell's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks for the following key reasons:

1. Strong Q2 performance with EPS above guidance, margins expanding in all segments, and organic growth accelerating to 3%

2. Management raised the low end of full-year guidance and expressed confidence in meeting 5-year targets despite macro uncertainties

3. While some segments face near-term headwinds (UOP in Q4, defense timing), the overall business momentum is solid with record orders in key areas and proactive restructuring/productivity initiatives continuing

However, the upside may be somewhat limited as much of the good news appears priced in and management maintained a relatively cautious macro outlook.
