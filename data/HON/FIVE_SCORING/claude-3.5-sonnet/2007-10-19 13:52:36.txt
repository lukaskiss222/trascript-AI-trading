Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Strong Financial Performance:
- 10% sales growth to $8.7B
- 23% EPS growth to $0.81 (high end of guidance)
- Free cash flow up 16% to $736M
- Raised full-year guidance

2. Broad-Based Strength:
- Growth across all major segments
- Strong global presence with growth in all regions
- Robust order backlog, especially in Aerospace and ACS

3. Management Confidence:
- Clear visibility into Q4 and early 2008
- Strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities
- Effective capital deployment with well-timed share repurchases

While there were some minor concerns around Transportation Systems margins and ACS mix issues, these appear manageable and are overshadowed by the overall strong performance and raised guidance.
