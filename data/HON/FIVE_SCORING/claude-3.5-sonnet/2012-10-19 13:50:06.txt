Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 week) impact on Honeywell's stock:

The earnings call revealed strong execution and positive trends, including:
- Solid margin expansion (110 basis points) despite slower growth
- Strong productivity and cost controls driving earnings growth
- Healthy backlog and wins in key growth areas
- Continued investment in new products and growth initiatives
- Upbeat but balanced outlook for 2013 with expected margin improvement

While macro uncertainty exists, management demonstrated confidence in their ability to perform well in a slow growth environment through operational excellence and strategic investments. The acquisition of Thomas Russell also appears value-creating.

This combination of strong execution, margin expansion potential, and strategic positioning should drive positive sentiment in the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
