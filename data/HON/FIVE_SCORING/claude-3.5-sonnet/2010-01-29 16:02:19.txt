Based on this earnings call transcript, I would predict a positive short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price. Here's my reasoning:

1. Strong Q4 execution despite tough conditions - maintained margins, generated over $1B in free cash flow, and exceeded prior year performance in several segments

2. Management expressed increased confidence in 2010 outlook, particularly in high-growth segments like Transportation Systems and ACS, while maintaining conservative planning assumptions

3. Significant cost reductions and restructuring benefits ($300M+) will flow through in 2010, providing margin support even as revenues recover

4. Strong backlog ($11B) and signs of stabilization/improvement in key end markets like Turbo, industrial products, and emerging regions

While there are some near-term headwinds in aerospace aftermarket and defense, the overall tone was constructive and management demonstrated strong execution capabilities through the downturn. The company appears well-positioned for the recovery.
