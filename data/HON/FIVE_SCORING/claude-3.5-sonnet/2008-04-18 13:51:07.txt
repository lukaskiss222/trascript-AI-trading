Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong Q1 2008 results exceeded guidance, with sales up 11%, organic growth across all regions, and EPS up 30% to $0.85 (beating estimates by $0.02)

2. Management raised full-year sales guidance and tightened EPS guidance to the high end of the previous range ($3.70-$3.80)

3. The company demonstrated resilience across its diversified portfolio, with strong performance in Aerospace, ACS, and Specialty Materials segments despite some economic headwinds

4. Major contract wins ($27B+ in Aerospace) and strategic acquisitions (Norcross) position the company well for continued growth

5. Management expressed strong confidence in outlook and ability to execute, while maintaining pricing power and implementing cost controls

While there are some challenges (automotive aftermarket softness, European economy concerns), the overall tone was very positive with multiple signs of sustainable momentum.
