Based on the earnings call transcript, here is my analysis of the likely short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on Honeywell's stock price:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q3 results with 20% EPS growth on 6% sales growth
- Proactively took restructuring actions using gain from divestiture
- Strong cash flow generation and healthy liquidity position
- Diversified portfolio with ~50% in stable long-cycle businesses

Key Concerns:
- Weakening trends in Transportation Systems (turbo) segment
- Conservative Q4 guidance reflecting macro uncertainties
- Some inventory correction and channel weakness emerging
- Pension headwinds likely for 2009

Overall, while management demonstrated proactive cost management and portfolio strength, the conservative near-term outlook and emerging signs of weakness in certain segments will likely weigh on investor sentiment in the very short term. The company appears well-positioned longer-term but near-term headwinds may pressure the stock.
