Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong Q4 and full year 2007 results with revenue up 12%, EPS up 26%, and robust free cash flow generation.

2. Management expressed confidence in their 2008 guidance despite economic concerns, targeting 16-21% EPS growth and maintaining a positive outlook across segments.

3. Continued momentum in key growth initiatives (HOS, Functional Transformation) and strong order rates, particularly in ACS (up 30% in Q4).

4. Geographic diversification and strong emerging market presence helping buffer potential US slowdown.

The main risk factor is broader economic uncertainty, but management appears well-prepared with contingency plans and cost controls in place.
