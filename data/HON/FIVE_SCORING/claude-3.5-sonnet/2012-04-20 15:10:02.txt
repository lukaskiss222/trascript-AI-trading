Based on my analysis of the earnings call transcript, I predict a positive short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.

Key positive factors:
- Strong Q1 results with EPS exceeding guidance 
- Increased full-year guidance
- Margin expansion across segments
- Strong commercial aerospace performance
- Robust order pipeline in UOP business
- Management tone was confident and highlighted continued execution strength
- Signs of improvement in short-cycle businesses exiting Q1

Minor concerns include some weakness in Europe/China and defense headwinds, but these appear to be well understood and incorporated into guidance.

Overall, the strong execution, raised guidance, and management's confident tone suggest the stock should react positively in the short-term as the market digests these results.
