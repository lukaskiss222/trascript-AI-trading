Based on the earnings call transcript, Honeywell demonstrated strong Q1 2020 performance with better-than-expected results across most segments. Key positives include:

1. Raised full-year guidance on both EPS and free cash flow
2. Strong margin expansion across 3 of 4 segments
3. Early cycle businesses showing robust recovery
4. Healthy order growth across segments
5. Management expressed increased confidence in outlook and execution

However, some caution points:
- Aerospace recovery timing remains uncertain
- Second half faces tougher comps
- Supply chain constraints could emerge
- Raw material cost pressures

Given the strong Q1 beat, raised guidance, broad-based momentum across segments, and management's confident tone regarding their competitive position for the recovery, this earnings report is likely to drive positive stock movement over the next 1-2 weeks.
