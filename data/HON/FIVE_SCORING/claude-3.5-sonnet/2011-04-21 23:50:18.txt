Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess this as having a positive short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price. Key factors supporting this view:

1. Strong Q1 2022 performance with revenues up 15% and EPS up 40% year-over-year, significantly beating guidance
2. Management raised full-year guidance based on broad-based strength across segments and geographies
3. Order momentum accelerating in long-cycle businesses (Process Solutions and UOP) indicating sustainable growth
4. Strong margin expansion of 120bps with all segments showing improvement
5. Minimal exposure to Japan supply chain disruptions

While there are some headwinds from raw material inflation and potential supply chain risks, the overall tone was very confident and the company appears well-positioned to continue executing strongly in the near-term.
