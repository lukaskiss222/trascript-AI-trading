Based on the earnings call transcript, Honeywell delivered another strong quarter with solid execution across their portfolio. Key positives include:

- Strong margin expansion across all segments, with overall segment margins up 170bps to 18.4%
- Commercial aerospace trends improving with good aftermarket growth
- ACS showing solid growth, particularly in high-growth regions like China (~10% growth)
- $3.2B backlog for Solstice low-global warming products
- Raised low end of full-year EPS guidance by $0.05

While there are some headwinds in oil & gas markets affecting PMT segment, management demonstrated strong cost control and operational execution to deliver results. The company continues to invest in growth while maintaining margin discipline. Management's confident tone and track record of execution, combined with raised guidance, suggests the stock should react positively in the near-term.
