Based on my analysis of Honeywell's Q1 2014 earnings call, I expect a positive short-term (1-2 weeks) impact on the stock price for the following key reasons:

1. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance at the lower end by $0.05 and increased free cash flow guidance by $300M, demonstrating confidence in the outlook. Q1 results exceeded expectations on margins, earnings and cash flow.

2. Management highlighted accelerating organic growth momentum into Q2 and H2 2014, with improvements across most segments and particularly strong order trends in building solutions and process solutions businesses.

3. While there were some mixed signals (slower defense/space sales, PMT margin pressure), the overall tone was confident, with executives emphasizing continued operational improvements, restructuring benefits, and strategic portfolio positioning.

Rating: [1] (Positive impact on stock price over next 1-2 weeks)
