Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key factors include:

1) Strong Q3 results with EPS above guidance, margins expanding across all segments, and raised full-year guidance.

2) Management expressed confidence in 2012 growth prospects despite macro uncertainties, highlighting strong commercial aerospace momentum, growing backlogs in key businesses, and benefits from restructuring actions.

3) The company took proactive steps to redeploy gains into cost reduction initiatives that will benefit 2012 and beyond, demonstrating strong operational execution.

While there are some headwinds (defense spending, uncertain macro environment), the overall tone was quite positive with management emphasizing their strong positioning and ability to outperform regardless of economic conditions. The quality of earnings and confidence in forward outlook should drive positive sentiment.
