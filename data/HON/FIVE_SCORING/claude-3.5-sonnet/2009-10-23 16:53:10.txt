Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price for the following reasons:

1. The company demonstrated strong execution and cost controls, maintaining segment margins despite significant revenue declines, with margins actually expanding in 3 out of 4 segments.

2. Management raised free cash flow guidance to $3 billion and expressed confidence in meeting full-year EPS targets, showing resilience in a challenging environment.

3. While headwinds exist (pension costs, continued weak commercial aerospace), there are positive signs including stabilization in several end markets, improving orders in energy efficiency, and expected growth in Turbo business.
