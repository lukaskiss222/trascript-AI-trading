Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess the short-term impact on Honeywell's stock to be positive. Key supporting factors include:

1. Strong Q4 results with revenues up 8%, segment margins expanding 90bps to 15.1%, and EPS growing 21% to $1.05.

2. Management reaffirmed 2012 guidance despite macro uncertainties, showing confidence in their ability to execute. The company has good backlog visibility and continues to see strength in long-cycle businesses.

3. While acknowledging headwinds in Europe, the company is well-positioned with 40% of European exposure in resilient long-cycle businesses. Strong growth continues in emerging markets and U.S.

However, some caution due to:
- Softer short-cycle business trends in Europe
- Conservative guidance for 2012 margins
- Management acknowledgment of macro uncertainties

Overall, the strong execution, reaffirmed guidance, and management's confident tone suggest positive stock momentum in the near-term despite macro concerns.
