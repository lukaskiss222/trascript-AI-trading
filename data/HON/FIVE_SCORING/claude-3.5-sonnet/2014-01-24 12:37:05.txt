Based on the earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Positive Points:
- Strong Q4 results with 8% sales growth (5% organic) and margin expansion across all businesses
- Confident 2014 guidance with 3-4% organic growth
- Significant restructuring benefits locked in for 2015-2016
- Strong China growth of 13% in Q4
- Robust commercial aerospace aftermarket trends

Key Concerns:
- Conservative guidance and cautious macro outlook
- Margin headwinds in Q1 from Intermec acquisition dilution and UOP mix
- Some temporary benefits in Q4 from one-time items and deployment of gains
- Limited near-term catalysts until March investor day

The results and outlook were solid but largely in-line with expectations. While execution remains strong, much of the good news appears priced in and management's cautious tone suggests limited upside catalyst in the very near-term.
