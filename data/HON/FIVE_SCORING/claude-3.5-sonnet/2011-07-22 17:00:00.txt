Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price. The company reported strong Q2 results with sales up 15%, EPS up 40%, and raised full-year guidance for the third consecutive time. Key positives include robust commercial aerospace aftermarket growth, strong performance in Specialty Materials, healthy order rates, and smart deployment of gains from divestitures. While there are some headwinds like defense budget pressures and moderating growth rates in some segments, management demonstrated confident execution and provided an optimistic outlook for continued growth in 2012.
