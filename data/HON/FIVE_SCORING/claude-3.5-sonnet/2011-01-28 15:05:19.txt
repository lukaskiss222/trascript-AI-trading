Based on my analysis of Honeywell's Q4 2010 earnings call, I see several positive indicators for the stock's near-term performance:

Key Positives:
- Strong Q4 results with 12% revenue growth and record organic growth
- Raised 2011 EPS guidance by $0.10 despite CPG divestiture
- Robust order rates across all segments entering 2011
- Strategic sale of CPG business with smart redeployment of proceeds
- Management expressed high confidence in achieving/exceeding 5-year targets

Minor Concerns:
- Some defense budget headwinds expected
- Labor cost headwinds impacting margins in Q4 2010
- Integration costs from Experion acquisition temporarily impacting ACS margins

The overall tone was very positive, with management demonstrating strong execution and expressing increasing confidence in their outlook. The company appears well-positioned for continued growth and margin expansion in 2011. The strategic moves around CPG and capital deployment should create additional shareholder value.

Given these factors, I expect the stock to react positively over the next 1-2 weeks.
