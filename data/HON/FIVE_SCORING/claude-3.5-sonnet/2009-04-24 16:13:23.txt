Based on this earnings call transcript, here's my analysis of the likely 1-2 week stock price impact:

Key Negative Factors:
- Significantly reduced full-year EPS guidance ($2.85-3.20 vs previous range)
- Weak Q1 results with sales down 15% and challenging Q2 outlook
- Continued deterioration in key markets like commercial aerospace and transportation
- Large pension headwind of ~$500M for 2010
- Management admitting they weren't conservative enough in prior forecasts

Key Positive Factors:
- Q1 results were in-line with guidance despite tough conditions
- Aggressive cost cutting and restructuring actions underway ($470M)
- Signs of stabilization in some end markets
- Strong liquidity position maintained
- Transparent and credible management communication

Conclusion: Despite management's credibility in addressing issues head-on, the magnitude of the guidance cut and continued market deterioration will likely pressure the stock in the near-term. The pension headwind revelation for 2010 adds another concerning datapoint. While long-term prospects remain solid, near-term trading will likely be negative as estimates get reset lower.
