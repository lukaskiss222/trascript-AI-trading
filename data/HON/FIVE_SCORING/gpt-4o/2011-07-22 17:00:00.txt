Honeywell's Q2 2011 earnings report shows a stellar performance with sales up 15% and EPS up 40%, both exceeding expectations, which has led to a raised full-year guidance. The company has exhibited strong growth across various segments such as aerospace, ACS, and transportation systems, demonstrating robust execution amidst macroeconomic uncertainties. The positive outlook, along with strategic moves like the EMS acquisition and a focus on emerging markets, indicates a likely short-term rally in the stock as investors respond to these solid financials and upward guidance revision.
