Honeywell's Q3 2013 earnings call indicates positive aspects and potential challenges. The company reported strong EPS growth and margin expansion despite lower-than-expected sales, primarily due to the timing of the Intermec acquisition and Defense & Space sales. Management expressed confidence in delivering at the high end of guidance for 2013 due to strong short-cycle business performance and geographic expansions, particularly in Europe and China. While macroeconomic uncertainties and defense-related issues remain, the consistent execution and strategic acquisitions suggest a favorable short-term stock performance.
