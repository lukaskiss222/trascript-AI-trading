Honeywell reported a strong finish to 2009, maintaining high margins and generating substantial free cash flow despite sales declines during a challenging economic period. The company has outlined a conservative approach for 2010, with EPS guidance reflecting confidence in strategic investments and operational momentum. Management's focus on energy efficiency, market resilience, and cautious optimism for recovery underlines potential growth, though uncertainties in aerospace remain a concern. In the short term, the stable outlook and robust operational performance will likely have a positive impact on the stock.
