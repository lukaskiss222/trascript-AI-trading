Honeywell's earnings call showcased strong Q2 2018 results, exceeding guidance on EPS and free cash flow.  Management's optimistic outlook and raised full-year guidance, coupled with continued strong order and backlog growth, suggest a positive short-term impact.  The company's focus on connected technologies through software and acquisitions bodes well for future performance, though potential tariff impacts remain a moderate risk in the short-term.
