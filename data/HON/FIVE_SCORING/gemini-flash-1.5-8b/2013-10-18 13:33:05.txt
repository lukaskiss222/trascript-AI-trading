Honeywell's Q3 2013 earnings exceeded expectations, driven by strong sales conversion and margin expansion despite lower-than-projected sales in Defense & Space, partially due to the Intermec acquisition timing and supply chain constraints. Positive guidance adjustments and a projected acceleration in organic growth into 2014 suggest a positive short-term outlook, potentially supporting stock price appreciation.
