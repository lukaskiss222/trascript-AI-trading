Honeywell's earnings call highlighted a cautious yet optimistic outlook.  While the company experienced some softness in key segments like aerospace, especially business jets, management emphasizes investments in growth areas like transportation, low-global-warming materials, and software solutions.  The significant restructuring actions and strategic acquisitions are projected to provide substantial margin expansion and EPS growth in 2017, offsetting short-term pressures in aerospace.
