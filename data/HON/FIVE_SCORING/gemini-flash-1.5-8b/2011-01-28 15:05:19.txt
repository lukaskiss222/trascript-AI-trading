Honeywell's earnings call highlights strong Q4 2010 results, exceeding expectations on both sales and earnings.  Management expressed confidence in the ongoing recovery and raised guidance for 2011, citing positive order rates and strong performance across segments (particularly in emerging markets). The planned sale of CPG, along with the redeployment of proceeds, will further enhance shareholder value. The short-term impact is likely to be positive, with investors anticipating a stock rally based on the improved guidance and the firm's resilient performance amidst economic recovery.
