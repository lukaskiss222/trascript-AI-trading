Honeywell's Q1 2014 earnings call highlighted strong performance exceeding guidance, driven by operational efficiency and execution.  Management's proactive restructuring actions and positive outlook for organic growth in the second half of the year, including specific examples like double-digit growth in China for several business segments, suggest a positive near-term outlook. The revised full-year guidance, despite some headwinds in defense and space, further strengthens the positive sentiment.
