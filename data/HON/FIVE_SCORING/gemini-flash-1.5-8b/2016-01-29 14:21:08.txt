Honeywell's earnings call highlighted strong Q4 2015 results, exceeding guidance and demonstrating continued margin expansion.  Management reaffirmed 2016 guidance and emphasized robust M&A activity (including the Elster acquisition), particularly in the UOP segment, suggesting potential for future earnings growth.  The cautious tone regarding the overall slow-growth market and some specific segments like commercial vehicles indicates a short-term focus on managing costs rather than aggressive expansion.
