Honeywell's Q3 2014 earnings call signaled continued strong performance, exceeding guidance on several key metrics.  Management highlighted broad-based organic sales growth, margin expansion, and robust order books across various segments.  The forward-looking guidance, while conservative, suggests Honeywell anticipates continued outperformance in Q4 and 2015, driven by strong backlog and new product introductions.  This positive outlook, coupled with strategic initiatives, is likely to encourage investor confidence and lead to a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
