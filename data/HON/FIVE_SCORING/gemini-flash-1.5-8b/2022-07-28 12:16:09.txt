Honeywell's Q2 FY2022 earnings call shows strong operational performance, exceeding guidance.  Management highlighted robust organic sales growth, margin expansion, and significant share repurchases.  However, the call also acknowledged challenges from the ongoing supply chain constraints, the fallout from the Russian operation wind-down, and the impact of reduced COVID-related mask sales. This combined with higher foreign currency impact leads to a cautious outlook for the short term, with a projected 7% to 11% organic sales growth in Q3, and a more modest expectation for Q4.
