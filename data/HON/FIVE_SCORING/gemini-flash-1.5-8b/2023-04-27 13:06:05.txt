Honeywell's Q1 2023 earnings call highlighted strong performance exceeding guidance, driven by robust growth in Aerospace and PMT segments.  Management expressed confidence in the company's ability to continue outperforming, citing favorable order trends, backlog, and operational improvements.  The acquisition of Compressor Controls Corporation also strengthens Honeywell's sustainability portfolio.  These factors suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price due to an updated outlook with higher year-end guidance.
