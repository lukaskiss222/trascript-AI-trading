Honeywell's Q3 2023 earnings call highlighted strong performance in aerospace, particularly in commercial aviation and defense/space, driving record backlog and double-digit order growth.  Management expressed confidence in the long-term outlook, emphasizing the company's ability to navigate macroeconomic headwinds.  However, short-cycle businesses like Safety and Productivity Solutions remain challenged, though there are indications of stabilization.  Given the positive outlook for aerospace and the ongoing buybacks, the stock is likely to see a positive short-term impact.
