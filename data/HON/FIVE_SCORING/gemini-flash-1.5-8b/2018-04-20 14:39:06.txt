Honeywell's Q1 2018 earnings call shows strong performance exceeding guidance, with organic sales growth, margin expansion, and substantial free cash flow.  Management expressed confidence in continued growth, especially in Aerospace, Performance Materials & Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions, citing robust order rates and backlog.  Revised full-year guidance reflects this positive outlook, increasing sales and EPS projections.  The likely short-term impact is a positive stock price rally driven by strong financial results and optimistic outlook.
