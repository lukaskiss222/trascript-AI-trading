Honeywell's Q1 2016 earnings call shows strong performance exceeding expectations, particularly in Commercial Aviation, Building Solutions, and Process Solutions.  Management raised full-year EPS guidance, indicating confidence in continued growth, especially in the second half with strong catalysts and backlog.  However, short-term stock impact may be muted due to uncertainty around sales growth compared to challenging prior year comparisons and variable customer behaviors.
