Honeywell's earnings call highlighted strong Q4 2013 results, exceeding guidance and demonstrating broad-based growth across businesses. Management expressed confidence in the continuing trend of margin expansion and order momentum in long-cycle businesses, driven by successful cost-cutting and strategic acquisitions.  While acknowledging a cautious macro environment, the call suggests Honeywell is well-positioned for continued strong performance in 2014 and beyond, particularly in light of positive trends in China and the commercial aftermarket.
