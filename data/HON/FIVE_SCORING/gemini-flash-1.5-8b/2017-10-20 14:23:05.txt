Honeywell's Q3 2017 earnings call highlighted strong organic sales growth (5%) exceeding guidance, segment profit increases, and margin expansion across all businesses.  Management is optimistic about the future, citing strong orders and backlog, particularly in aerospace and performance materials & technologies, and the positive outlook for emerging markets like China and India.  The raised full-year EPS and sales guidance, combined with the planned spin-offs, point to a positive short-term outlook for the stock price.
