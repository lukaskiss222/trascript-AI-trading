Honeywell's Q2 2017 earnings call shows strong performance across the board, exceeding sales guidance and increasing EPS.  Management highlighted significant investments in restructuring, new technologies, and acquisitions, all aimed at future growth.  The call emphasizes continued strength in the aerospace aftermarket and robust growth in China. While some segments face margin pressures, notably Home and Building Technologies, the overall positive outlook, particularly with increased sales guidance for the full year, will likely lead to a positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
