Honeywell's earnings call highlighted continued strong operational performance despite a challenging macro environment.  While core organic sales growth was slightly negative, management emphasized the diversity of its portfolio and pointed to significant growth in other segments, particularly in high-growth regions and the commercial aviation aftermarket.  The raised earnings guidance and the projected improvement in the second half, coupled with positive commentary about acquisitions, suggest a generally positive outlook for the stock over the next 1-2 weeks.
