Honeywell's earnings call highlighted strong Q2 2011 performance, exceeding expectations across several segments, particularly Aerospace and Specialty Materials.  Management raised full-year guidance significantly, citing robust commercial aftermarket sales and a positive outlook for the second half, especially in commercial aerospace and UOP. The call suggests a continuation of strong growth momentum, with a strategic focus on deploying gains from the CPG divestiture into share repurchases and pension fund contributions, positioning the firm for continued positive stock movement.
