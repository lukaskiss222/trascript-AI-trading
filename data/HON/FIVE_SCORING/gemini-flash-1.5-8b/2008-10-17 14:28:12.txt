Honeywell's earnings call highlighted robust performance despite a weakening economy, with key sectors like Aerospace, Defense, and Space exceeding expectations.  Management's proactive cost-cutting measures and leveraging the Consumables Solutions sale provide a strong buffer for future uncertainty.  Guidance remains positive for the fourth quarter and likely into 2009, positioning the stock for a period of likely positive impact due to the company's diverse portfolio and strong position in resilient markets.
