Honeywell's earnings call highlights strong organic sales growth, exceeding guidance, driven by aerospace and Building Solutions.  Management expresses confidence in the back half of the year, attributing this to long-term business strengths and a robust backlog.  However, short-term mix pressures in some segments are expected to lead to slightly lower than anticipated segment margins, though the overall profitability is anticipated to remain healthy.  The stock price should see positive movement based on the strong earnings and the increase in forecast.
