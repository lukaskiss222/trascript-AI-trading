Honeywell's earnings call highlights strong Q4 2016 results, exceeding expectations on earnings per share and free cash flow.  Management is optimistic about 2017, reaffirming guidance for 6-10% earnings growth.  The call also touches on positive trends in several key segments, particularly transportation systems and process solutions, but also notes some headwinds in defense and aerospace.  The short-term implications are likely to be positive, as the stock should see a boost reflecting the outperformance and renewed optimism.
