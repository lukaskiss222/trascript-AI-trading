Honeywell's earnings call highlights strong Q3 results exceeding guidance on EPS and margins, despite a softer macro environment.  Management emphasizes the strengths of Honeywell's diversified portfolio and long-term strategic investments in new products/technologies to drive future growth.  Acquisitions, like Elster, signal an aggressive approach to growth. The anticipated reduction in commercial vehicle sales and ongoing issues in some emerging markets are acknowledged by management, though overall positive guidance for Q4 and 2016 reinforces the stock's likely positive performance in the next few weeks.
