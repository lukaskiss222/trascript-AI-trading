Honeywell's earnings call highlights a continued challenging environment, but with resilience and strong cost-cutting measures.  While sales are down significantly, management emphasizes substantial cost-saving initiatives, including plant shutdowns and furloughs, which should offset the weakness.  The company's guidance remains conservative, focusing on delivering EPS at the lower end of their range, but the call suggests a possible slight improvement in the second half of the year as inventory destocking may ease and new product launches could yield returns.
