Honeywell's Q3 2012 earnings call highlighted continued strong margin expansion despite slower sales growth in a challenging economic environment. Management projected a flat to slightly positive sales outlook for Q4, primarily driven by continued strength in commercial aerospace and UOP's resilient performance.  The call emphasized robust reinvestment in R&D, CapEx, and restructuring, which suggests confidence in future growth and a cautious approach with respect to the macro environment.  The stock should show a positive impact in the short term, owing to the firm guidance and resilient operational performance.
