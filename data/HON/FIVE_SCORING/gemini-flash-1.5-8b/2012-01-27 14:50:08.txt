Honeywell's earnings call highlighted strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2011, exceeding expectations on EPS and free cash flow.  Management projects continued growth in 2012, particularly in Aerospace, but anticipates a more moderate pace due to the economic outlook in Europe.  The company is confident in their ability to maintain growth and expand margins despite the challenging global economic environment, pointing to strong backlog and market share gains as positive indicators.
