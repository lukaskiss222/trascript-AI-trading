Honeywell's Q1 2008 earnings call highlighted strong performance exceeding expectations, driven by organic growth across all segments, particularly in emerging markets.  Management emphasized a diversified portfolio, a balanced mix of short- and long-cycle businesses, and a strong global presence as key strengths. Increased sales guidance and tightened EPS guidance to the high end of the previous range suggest a positive outlook for the next 2 weeks.
