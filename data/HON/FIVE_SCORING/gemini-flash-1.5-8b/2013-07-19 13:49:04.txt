Honeywell's Q2 2013 earnings call signals continued strong performance despite a challenging macro environment.  Management highlighted record sales, margin expansion, and robust backlog across several segments.  They raised their full-year EPS guidance, indicating confidence in the company's ability to execute on its productivity and growth initiatives.  This positive outlook and guidance uplift should likely lead to a short-term stock price rally.
