Honeywell's Q1 2021 earnings call indicates strong performance exceeding expectations, with adjusted EPS above guidance and margin expansion in several segments.  Management highlighted robust growth in segments like safety and productivity solutions and connected software, partially offsetting declines in others.  The call points to continued supply chain challenges, particularly in semiconductors, but also notes management's proactive approach to pricing pressures, suggesting a cautious but optimistic outlook for the short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impacting stock price positively.
