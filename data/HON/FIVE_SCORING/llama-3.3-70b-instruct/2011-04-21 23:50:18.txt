Honeywell's Q1 earnings call revealed a strong start to 2011, with better-than-expected performance across the portfolio, yielding EPS above guidance. The company's sales, segment margins, and earnings growth all exceeded expectations, driven by continued improvement in end markets, growth from new products, and geographic expansion. Management's tone was optimistic, with a focus on executing the company's strategies and investing for future growth.

The company's guidance for 2011 was raised, with expected earnings in the range of $3.80 to $3.95 per share, reflecting a 27% to 32% increase over the prior year. The strong momentum in end markets, combined with the company's strategic initiatives, suggests a positive outlook for the stock.

Given the strong Q1 results and raised guidance, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
