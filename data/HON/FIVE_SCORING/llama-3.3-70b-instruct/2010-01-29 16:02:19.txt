Honeywell International Inc.'s earnings call revealed a strong finish to 2009, with the company executing well operationally and delivering on financial commitments despite a tough economic environment. The company's guidance for 2010 is cautious, with modest organic sales growth expected, and a focus on maintaining good cost controls. While there are concerns around certain segments, such as Aerospace, the company's diversification and investments in emerging markets and new products are expected to drive growth. The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short-term due to the company's ability to deliver on its commitments and its strong financial position.
