Honeywell International Inc.'s Q1 2022 earnings transcript reveals a strong start to the year, with better-than-expected performance across several businesses, driven by diversity of opportunity and solid execution. The company reported sales of $9.3 billion, representing 7% reported growth and 6% organic growth, with segment margins expanding 70 basis points to 15.2%. Despite a challenging macro environment, Honeywell's long-cycle businesses, particularly Commercial Aerospace and UOP, performed well, while short-cycle businesses faced headwinds in Europe and China. Management raised full-year guidance, expecting earnings to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.55 per share, representing 9% to 14% growth. The company's focus on margin expansion, seed planting for growth, and strategic acquisitions is expected to drive long-term performance.
