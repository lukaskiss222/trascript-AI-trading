Honeywell International Inc.'s Q1 earnings call revealed a strong start to 2013, with EPS above guidance and margin expansion driven by cost management and productivity. Despite a slow growth macro environment, the company's balanced portfolio and focus on seed planting for future growth position it well for long-term success. However, tempered guidance and uncertainties around key contracts may lead to short-term pressure on the stock.
