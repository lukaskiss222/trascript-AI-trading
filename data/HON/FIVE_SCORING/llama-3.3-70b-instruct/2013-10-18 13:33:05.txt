Honeywell's Q3 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company delivering double-digit EPS growth despite lower-than-expected sales. The delayed closure of the Intermec acquisition and supply chain constraints in Defense & Space were notable headwinds. However, management's tone was upbeat, citing a strong pipeline of new product introductions, improving short-cycle trends, and continued margin expansion. With a revised EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $4.95, the company appears poised for a solid finish to 2013. Looking ahead to 2014, Honeywell expects organic growth to accelerate, driven by short-cycle improvement, new product launches, and geographic expansion.
