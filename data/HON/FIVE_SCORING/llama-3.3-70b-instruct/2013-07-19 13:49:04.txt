Honeywell's Q2 earnings report showed strong execution and margin expansion, with sales of $9.7 billion and EPS of $1.22, up 8% year-over-year. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance range to $4.85 to $4.95, driven by its ability to offset inflation with pricing and productivity. The Aerospace segment saw sales growth in the commercial aftermarket, while the ACS segment had growth in all three sub-segments. The PMT segment saw strong growth in UOP, but a decline in Advanced Materials. The company continues to invest in R&D, new product introductions, and capacity expansion, and expects to benefit from its restructuring pipeline and acquisition integrations. Overall, Honeywell's performance suggests a positive short-term impact on its stock price.
