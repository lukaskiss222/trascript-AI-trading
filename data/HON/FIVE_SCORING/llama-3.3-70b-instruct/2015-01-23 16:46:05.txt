Honeywell International Inc.'s Q4 earnings report showed strong performance, with better-than-expected operational results and double-digit earnings growth. The company's guidance for 2015 also indicates confidence in its ability to deliver sales and earnings growth despite a slow-growth macro environment. Management's tone was positive, highlighting the company's diversified portfolio, investments in new products and technologies, and expansion into high-growth regions. With a strong backlog and orders growth, particularly in the Process Solutions segment, Honeywell is well-positioned for continued outperformance.
