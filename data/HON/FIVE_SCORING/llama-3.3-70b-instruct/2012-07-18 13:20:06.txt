Honeywell International Inc.'s Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed performance, with the company beating EPS expectations but reporting slower sales growth due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. The company's long-cycle businesses, such as Aerospace and UOP, continued to perform well, while short-cycle businesses faced headwinds, particularly in Europe. Management raised the low end of their 2012 EPS guidance range, citing strong margin expansion and disciplined cost control. Despite uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment, Honeywell's diversified portfolio and focus on cost management position the company for continued outperformance.
