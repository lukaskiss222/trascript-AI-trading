Honeywell International Inc.'s Q1 earnings call revealed a strong start to the year, with EPS growing 10% year-over-year and exceeding guidance. The company's diversified portfolio and focus on productivity, innovation, and seed planting for future growth have contributed to its success. Management has raised full-year guidance for EPS and free cash flow, driven by a strong first quarter and confidence in its outlook. While there are some headwinds, such as defense and space declines and pricing challenges in Advanced Materials, the company is well-positioned for long-term growth and outperformance.
