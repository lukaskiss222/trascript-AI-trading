Despite Honeywell's strong Q4 performance and robust 2016 guidance, its stock could experience a short-term setback due to concerns about slow growth and potential headwinds in some key markets such as oil and gas. However, investors may quickly reassess this as Honeywell's diverse portfolio and robust pipeline of high-return projects should help mitigate these risks. The management's hamstring M&A strategy and focus on productivity and growth initiatives should further support the stock's upward trajectory in the medium term. [0]
