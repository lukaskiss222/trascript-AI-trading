The positive earnings report and outlook from Honeywell demonstrates robust performance across its segments, with particular strength in Aerospace and Automation Solutions. It’s well-positioned for 2012 with diverse revenue streams, robust long-cycle backlog, and successful new product launches. Management’s emphasis on cost-cutting and strategic investments is commendable. The stock will benefit from these tailwinds, despite potential macroeconomic headwinds, which are appropriately listed as unknowns.
