**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Honeywell International Inc. revealed a strong Q2 performance, with sales of $9.4 billion and EPS of $1.14, up 12% year-over-year. The company benefitted from a balanced portfolio of long- and short-cycle businesses, with strong performance in Commercial Aerospace and UOP. However, the call also highlighted challenges in the short-cycle businesses, particularly in Europe, and the impact of macroeconomic uncertainties. The company raised its EPS guidance for 2012, reflecting the strong first half performance and a balanced view of the risks and opportunities in the second half.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the strong Q2 performance and the raised EPS guidance. However, the uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment and the potential impact of the fiscal cliff may introduce some volatility in the stock price over the next 1â€“2 weeks. The company's focus on margin expansion and cost control, as well as its balanced portfolio, should provide a buffer against potential downturns. Therefore, the rating is:

**0**
