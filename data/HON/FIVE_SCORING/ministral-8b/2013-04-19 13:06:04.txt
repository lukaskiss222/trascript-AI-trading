**Analysis:**

Honeywell International Inc. reported a strong first quarter with EPS of $1.16, up 12% year-over-year, driven by robust margin expansion. Sales were $9.3 billion, in line with guidance. The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to $4.80-$4.95. Management highlighted continued growth in non-defense markets, including ACS and PMT, and a balanced portfolio approach. However, they maintained a cautious outlook due to a slow growth macro environment and potential sequestration impacts on defense spending. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:**

Given the mixed signals and cautious outlook, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure. However, the company's strong performance and balanced portfolio suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to be neutral in the next 1-2 weeks.
