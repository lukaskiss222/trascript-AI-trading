**Analysis:**

Honeywell's Q2 2009 earnings call revealed a challenging economic environment, with sales of $7.6 billion and EPS of $0.60. Despite the tough conditions, Honeywell managed to generate over $1 billion in free cash flow and achieved significant cost savings through various initiatives. The company's strategic focus on cost control, repositioning, and process improvements, such as the Honeywell Operating System and Velocity Product Development, helped offset the weak top-line environment. The guidance for the year was revised to reflect the continued challenges in the market, with EPS expected to be at the low end of the previous guidance range.

**Short-term implications:**

1. **Stock performance:** Honeywell's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and the continued uncertainty around key defense contracts.
2. **Market sentiment:** The earnings call highlighted the company's ability to navigate through tough economic conditions, which may boost investor confidence in the medium to long term.
3. **Cost savings and repositioning:** The aggressive cost actions and repositioning initiatives may provide a positive catalyst for the stock in the near term.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term outlook for Honeywell's stock is likely to be negative due to the tempered guidance and the continued uncertainty around key defense contracts. However, the company's focus on cost control, repositioning, and strategic growth initiatives may provide a positive catalyst for the stock in the medium to long term.
