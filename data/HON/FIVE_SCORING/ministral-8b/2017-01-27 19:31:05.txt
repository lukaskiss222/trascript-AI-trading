**Analysis:**
Honeywell's Q4 2016 earnings call revealed a strong finish to the year, with a 14% increase in EPS and 8% growth in free cash flow. The company's guidance for 2017 was reaffirmed, with EPS expected to grow by 6% to 10% and organic sales growth of 1% to 3%. The company highlighted its optimism about the growth of its connected initiatives, including JetWave, which is expected to be a significant growth driver in 2017 and beyond. Additionally, the company's focus on cost-saving measures and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and non-defense markets suggests long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:**
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral, as the company's strong performance and optimistic outlook for 2017 were well-received by analysts. However, the stock may face pressure in the near term due to the reduced 2018 forecast and uncertainties around key defense contracts. Overall, the stock is likely to remain stable in the short term, with a slight negative impact expected.

**Rating:**
