Based on the transcript, Honeywell International Inc. reported strong Q1 results with 5% organic sales growth, 14% earnings growth, and 30% free cash flow growth. The company raised its full-year organic sales growth guidance to a range of 3% to 5% and its EPS guidance to a range of $7.85 to $8.05. The company also raised its free cash flow guidance by $100 million. The company expects to see continued growth in its Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solutions segments, as well as in its PMT business. The company also expects to see continued demand for its Android-based products. The company's stock is likely to see short-term pressure due to the uncertainty around the Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs and the potential for further tariffs on China. However, the company's strong order rates and backlogs, as well as its robust pipeline of opportunities, suggest that the stock could see a rebound in the coming weeks.
