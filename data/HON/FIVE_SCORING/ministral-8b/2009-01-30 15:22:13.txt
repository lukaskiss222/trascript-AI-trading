**Analysis:**

Honeywell's Q4 and full-year 2008 earnings call revealed a mixed performance, with sales and earnings growing despite a challenging economic environment. The company's Aerospace and ACS businesses performed well, while Transportation Systems faced headwinds. Management highlighted the company's strong financial position, cash generation, and the benefits of its five initiatives. However, the company's guidance for 2009 was cautious, with expectations for a tough first half due to economic conditions and weaker comps. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative, with a rating of -1, due to the cautious guidance and economic uncertainties.
