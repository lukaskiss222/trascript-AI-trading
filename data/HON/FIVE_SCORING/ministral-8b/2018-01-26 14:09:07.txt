### Analysis:
Honeywell's Q4 and full-year 2017 earnings call presented a mixed picture. The company reported strong financial results, with EPS exceeding guidance and a significant increase in cash flow. However, the company also faced challenges such as delays in the U.S. tax reform implementation and the potential impact of cost-saving measures. The analysts' questions highlighted concerns about the company's ability to maintain growth and profitability in the face of these challenges.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on Honeywell's stock price is expected to be negative due to the uncertainty surrounding the tax reform implementation and the potential impact of cost-saving measures. The company's strong financial results and positive outlook for 2018 may provide some support, but the uncertainty surrounding the tax reform and the company's ability to maintain growth and profitability in the face of these challenges could lead to a short-term sell-off.
