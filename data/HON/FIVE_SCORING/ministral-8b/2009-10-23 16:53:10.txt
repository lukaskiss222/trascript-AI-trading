### Analysis

The earnings call for Honeywell International Inc. revealed a mixed bag of results with some positive signs and areas of concern. The company reported better-than-expected results for the third quarter, with sales of $7.7 billion and EPS of $0.80. This was achieved despite a challenging economic environment, driven by strong growth initiatives and cost-saving measures. However, there are several key areas that will impact Honeywell’s performance in the near term:

1. **Market Conditions**: The company continues to face challenges in commercial aero and construction, which are expected to weigh on top-line growth. While there are signs of stabilization, the rate of decline in orders and revenue is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.

2. **Pension Expense**: Pension expense is expected to increase significantly in 2010, with a projected headwind of approximately $700 million. This is a non-cash expense and will not reflect the company’s actual funding requirements.

3. **Currency Impact**: The dollar’s appreciation is expected to provide a tailwind in the fourth quarter, but the company is cautious about planning for 2010 due to the uncertainty of currency movements.

4. **Energy Retrofit**: The company is seeing increased activity in energy retrofit work, but it is too early to see the full impact on financials. The stimulus program has reignited orders, and there is a growing awareness of energy efficiency work.

5. **Labor Inflation**: The company expects some labor inflation to return in 2010, which will partially offset the benefits from repositioning actions taken in 2009.

### Conclusion

Given the mixed signals and ongoing challenges, the stock price is likely to face short-term pressure. The company’s ability to generate strong free cash flow and maintain margins in a tough environment is encouraging, but the uncertainty around market conditions, pension expense, and currency movements suggests that the stock may not see significant upside in the near term. The rating for the short-term impact on the stock price is:
