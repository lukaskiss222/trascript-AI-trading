### Analysis:
The Honeywell International Inc. earnings call revealed a mixed picture. While the company reported strong Q1 results, including an adjusted EPS of $1.91, the outlook for the rest of the year was tempered by ongoing macroeconomic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties. The company's guidance for Q2 and full-year 2022 was revised downward due to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and supply chain disruptions. Despite these challenges, Honeywell's management expressed confidence in its ability to execute on its value-creation framework and maintain its position in the market. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the revised guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Conclusion:
The short-term impact on Honeywell's stock is likely to be negative due to the revised guidance and ongoing uncertainties. The stock is expected to face pressure in the coming weeks.
