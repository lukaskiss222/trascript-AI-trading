**Analysis:**

The Honeywell International Inc. earnings call delivered mixed signals. Despite the challenging economic conditions, the company reported strong financial results with organic sales growth and double-digit earnings growth. Management highlighted the company's strong position in robust macro trends and its diverse portfolio, which includes both long and short cycle businesses. The company also announced a $417 million after-tax gain from the sale of its consumable solutions business, which it plans to use for repositioning and other cost-saving actions. However, the company's outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year was cautious, with guidance projecting a 2% increase in sales and a 7% to 11% increase in EPS. The company also noted the potential impact of the Boeing strike and the asbestos trust funding on its cash flow for 2009.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on Honeywell's stock price is likely to be neutral, as the company's strong financial results and cautious outlook are both present. The stock may experience some volatility due to the economic uncertainty and the company's cautious guidance. However, the company's strong position in robust macro trends and its diverse portfolio should provide some support to the stock price in the short term.
