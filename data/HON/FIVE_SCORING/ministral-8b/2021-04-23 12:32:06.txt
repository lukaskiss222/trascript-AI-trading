**Analysis:**

Honeywell reported strong Q1 results, exceeding expectations with $1.92 EPS and $21% segment margin. The company is optimistic about growth in Intelligrated, HBT, SPS, and Sparta. However, they face challenges from supply chain constraints, particularly semiconductors and resins, which will impact margins in Q2. The company is bullish on the recovery of aviation and expects OE rates to slowly increase in the second half of 2021 and 2022. Inflation is a concern, but the company is committed to staying ahead of it. The stock is likely to see positive short-term impact due to strong Q1 results and positive guidance for the rest of the year.
