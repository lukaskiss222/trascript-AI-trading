8. **Integration Costs**: Honeywell expects to incur integration costs associated with the acquisitions in the early stages of integration. However, the company expects these costs to be offset by the accretive nature of the acquisitions.

Based on the earnings call, Honeywell's stock is expected to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the strong second-quarter results, the expected top-line acceleration in the second half, and the company's strategic initiatives. However, the stock may face short-term pressure due to the margin contraction in the second half and the integration costs associated with the acquisitions.
