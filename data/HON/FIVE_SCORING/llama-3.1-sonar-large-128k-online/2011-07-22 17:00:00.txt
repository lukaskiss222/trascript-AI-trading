Honeywell International's second-quarter 2011 earnings call highlighted several positive trends and some strategic adjustments that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term:

- **Strong Financial Performance**: Honeywell reported better-than-expected results, with sales up 15%, EPS up 40%, and raised guidance for the year. This strong performance is likely to be positively received by investors.
- **Commercial Aerospace Recovery**: The commercial aerospace aftermarket is showing robust recovery, with spares and R&O (Repair and Overhaul) sales increasing significantly. This trend is expected to continue, supporting future growth.
- **Organic Growth and Acquisitions**: The company is seeing strong organic growth across various segments, and recent acquisitions are contributing positively to sales and margin expansion.
- **Redeployment of Gains**: The gain from the CPG sale will be redeployed into repositioning and other growth initiatives, which is expected to provide additional benefits in 2012 and beyond.
- **Margin Expansion**: Despite some headwinds from launch payments and commodity inflation, the company is expecting margin expansion in key segments, particularly in Aerospace and Specialty Materials.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience positive momentum in the short term due to the strong earnings performance, raised guidance, and continued execution on strategic initiatives.
