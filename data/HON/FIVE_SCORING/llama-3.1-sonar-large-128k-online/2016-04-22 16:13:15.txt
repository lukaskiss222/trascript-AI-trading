Honeywell International Inc.'s first-quarter 2016 earnings call presented several positive and some mixed signals that are likely to influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Signals:
- Honeywell delivered strong results, with EPS increasing 9% to $1.53, exceeding the high end of their guidance range.
- Core organic sales grew 1%, exceeding expectations, driven by strong performance in Aerospace, Commercial Aftermarket, and Transportation Systems, as well as growth in China and other high-growth regions.
- The company raised the low end of its full-year EPS guidance to $6.55-$6.70, indicating confidence in future performance.
- Significant investments in new products, high-ROI capital expenditures, and strategic acquisitions are expected to drive future growth.
- Strong free cash flow guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion for the full year supports long-term financial health.

### Mixed Signals:
- Segment margins were down 60 basis points year-over-year, though this was partly due to the dilutive impact of acquisitions and other one-time factors.
- UOP catalyst sales were down significantly due to tough comparisons, but the company expects a recovery in the second half.
- Some segments, like S&PS, faced challenges due to distributor inventory levels and the completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract.

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the overall positive tone of the earnings call, including the beat on EPS, the raise in full-year guidance, and the strong operational performance despite some segment-specific challenges, the stock is likely to experience a positive short-term impact.
