Honeywell International Inc.'s third-quarter 2012 earnings call highlighted several key points that suggest a positive short-term outlook for the company's stock:

- **Strong Margin Expansion**: Despite a challenging economic environment, Honeywell achieved significant margin expansion of 110 basis points to 15.8%, driven by disciplined cost controls, productivity gains, and benefits from process initiatives like the Honeywell Operating System (HOS)[5].
- **Robust Earnings Growth**: Earnings per share (EPS) grew 9% to $1.20, with tax favorability contributing to this increase. Excluding this tax benefit, EPS would still be near the top end of the previously communicated guidance range[5].
- **Positive Outlook for 2013**: The company is expecting another year of strong margin expansion and earnings growth, even in a slow growth environment. They are planning for low single-digit sales growth but anticipate continued strong operational performance and benefits from seed planting initiatives and restructuring projects[5].
- **Healthy Backlog and New Wins**: Honeywell has a strong backlog, particularly in its long cycle businesses like Commercial Aerospace and UOP, which will support growth in 2013. New wins and acquisitions, such as Thomas Russell, are also expected to contribute positively[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's robust financial performance, strong operational discipline, and optimistic outlook for the future.
