The Honeywell International Inc. Q2 2009 earnings call presents a mixed picture but with several positive indicators that suggest the company is managing well despite challenging economic conditions.

### Key Points:
- **Strong Cost Management and Productivity**: Honeywell has implemented significant cost-saving measures, including repositioning actions, plant shut downs, and furloughs, which have yielded substantial savings and helped maintain margins[4].
- **Free Cash Flow**: The company generated over $1 billion in free cash flow, highlighting the quality of its earnings performance[4].
- **Segment Performance**: While sales were down across most segments, margins in Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) and Specialty Materials (SM) improved, indicating effective cost control and operational efficiency[4].
- **Guidance**: The full-year EPS guidance was reaffirmed at the low end of the previous range, reflecting continued tough market conditions but also the benefits of cost actions and repositioning[4].
- **Future Outlook**: The company is optimistic about 2010, with expected growth in Defense and Space, savings from repositioning actions, and potential rebounds in Turbo and Commercial Aerospace aftermarket businesses[4].

### Short-term Impact on Stock Price:
Given the strong cost management, solid free cash flow generation, and the fact that the company is executing well in a tough environment, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely positive. However, the reaffirmed guidance at the lower end and the continued challenges in end markets may temper the upside.

### Conclusion:
The stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to Honeywell's robust cost management, strong free cash flow, and the company's ability to execute well in challenging conditions.
