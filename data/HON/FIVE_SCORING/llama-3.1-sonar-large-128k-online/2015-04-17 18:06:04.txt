Honeywell International's first quarter 2015 earnings call presented a mixed picture but with several positive underlying trends. Here are the key points:

- **Strong Margin Expansion**: Despite a slow start and macroeconomic headwinds, Honeywell achieved significant margin expansion of 220 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, productivity improvements, and the benefits of HOS Gold initiatives[3].
- **Organic Growth**: While reported sales were down 5% due to foreign exchange headwinds and the divestiture of friction materials, core organic sales grew 2%[3].
- **Guidance Update**: The company raised the lower end of its full-year EPS guidance to $6.00-$6.15, reflecting confidence in its ability to manage through challenging macro conditions[3].
- **Sector Performance**: Aerospace, ACS, and PMT segments showed resilience, with aerospace and ACS exiting the quarter with strong momentum. PMT faced challenges due to oil and gas sector volatility but maintained robust margin performance[3].
- **Macro Environment**: Honeywell is cautious about the global economy but sees benefits from lower oil prices and is well-positioned to adapt with a diverse portfolio and strong cost management[3].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the solid earnings growth, strong margin expansion, and raised guidance, despite some headwinds from macroeconomic factors.
