- **Profitability**: Segment profit was up 10%, and net income increased by 17%, leading to a 24% increase in EPS.
- **Cash Flow**: The company generated $820 million in free cash flow, representing a 134% conversion rate, and raised its full-year free cash flow guidance.
- **Guidance**: Full-year sales, EPS, and free cash flow guidance were all increased, reflecting confidence in the company's outlook.
- **Segment Performance**: Aerospace, ACS, and to some extent, Transportation Systems showed strong growth, while Specialty Materials faced some challenges but remained on track for the year.
