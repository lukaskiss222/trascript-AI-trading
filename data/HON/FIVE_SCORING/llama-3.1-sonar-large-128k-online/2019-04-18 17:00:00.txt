Honeywell's first-quarter 2019 earnings call highlighted several positive aspects that are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term:

1. **Strong Organic Sales Growth**: Honeywell reported an 8% organic sales growth, driven by robust performance in long-cycle businesses such as commercial aerospace, defense, and warehouse and process automation. This exceeded expectations and sets a strong foundation for the year[5].

2. **Margin Expansion**: The company achieved significant margin expansion, with segment margins up 120 basis points to 20.4% and operating income margin up 190 basis points to 18.5%. This was driven by commercial excellence, higher sales volumes, and the benefits of previous repositioning projects[1][2][5].

3. **Raised Guidance**: Honeywell raised its full-year organic sales guidance to a range of 3% to 6% and earnings per share guidance to $7.90 to $8.15, indicating confidence in their ability to deliver strong results throughout the year[1][2][5].

4. **Cash Flow Performance**: Adjusted free cash flow grew 55%, excluding separation costs and spin impacts, with a conversion rate of 82%, the highest start to the year since 2010. This strong cash generation is a positive indicator[1][2].

5. **Positive Outlook**: Management expressed optimism about the business environment, highlighting strength in multiple segments and continued growth opportunities, particularly in long-cycle businesses. The only caution noted was around short-cycle businesses due to macro uncertainties, but this does not seem to deter overall confidence[5].

Given these positive indicators, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term.

**Rating: 2**
