- **Margin Expansion**: The company achieved segment margin expansion of 60 basis points year-over-year, driven by commercial excellence and effective cost management. This trend is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and 2023[1][3][4].
- **Robust Backlog and Orders**: Honeywell's backlog remains strong, up 9% year-over-year, with orders in key segments like Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies showing double-digit growth. This indicates sustained demand and supports growth expectations for 2023[1][3][4].
- **Positive Guidance**: The company raised the midpoint of its full-year organic sales and adjusted EPS guidance, despite absorbing significant foreign currency headwinds and other macroeconomic challenges[1][3][4].
- **Operational Improvements**: Honeywell continues to benefit from its digital transformation investments, supply chain improvements, and strategic pricing actions, all of which contribute to its operational resilience and efficiency[1][3][4].
