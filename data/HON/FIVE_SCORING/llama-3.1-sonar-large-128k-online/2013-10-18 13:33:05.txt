Honeywell International Inc.'s third-quarter 2013 earnings call presents a mixed but overall positive outlook. Here are the key points:

1. **Strong Margins and EPS Growth**: Despite lower-than-expected sales, Honeywell delivered strong segment margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth, driven by productivity gains and favorable mix[5>.
2. **Challenging Macro Environment**: The company faced headwinds from the defense sector due to sequestration and government shutdowns, but its balanced portfolio helped offset these challenges[5].
3. **Positive Outlook for 2014**: Honeywell anticipates organic growth acceleration in 2014, supported by new product introductions, geographic expansion, and a strong pipeline of projects. The company also expects benefits from restructuring and higher pension income[5].
4. **Short-Cycle Improvement**: The company saw improving short-cycle order rates, particularly in Energy, Safety, and Security (ESS) and Transportation Systems (TS), which bodes well for future growth[5].

Given these points, the short-term impact on Honeywell's stock is likely to be positive due to the company's strong execution, raised EPS guidance, and optimistic outlook for 2014.
