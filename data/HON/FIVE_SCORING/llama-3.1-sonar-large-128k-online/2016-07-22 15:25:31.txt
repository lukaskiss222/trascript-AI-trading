Honeywell's second-quarter 2016 earnings call presented several positive and some challenging aspects that could influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors
- **Strong Earnings Growth**: Honeywell reported a 10% increase in earnings per share, reaching $1.66, which is at the high end of their guidance range[3].
- **Operational Improvements**: The company saw a 110 basis points improvement in segment margins on an operational basis, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring actions, and disciplined cost controls[3].
- **Acquisitions and Strategic Moves**: The acquisition of Intelligrated and the realignment of Automation and Control Solutions into two new segments (Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions) are expected to drive future growth and efficiency[3].
- **Guidance Update**: Honeywell raised the low end of their full-year 2016 EPS guidance to $6.60-$6.70, indicating confidence in their performance despite a challenging macro environment[3].

### Challenging Factors
- **Core Organic Sales Growth**: While reported sales were up 2%, core organic sales declined by 2%, primarily due to headwinds in oil and gas, Defense and Space, and certain market pricing conditions[3].
- **Segment Performance**: Some segments, such as UOP and Defense and Space, faced significant challenges, including lower volumes and market headwinds[3].
- **Macro Environment Uncertainty**: The company acknowledged uncertainties due to Britain's exit from the European Union, though they expect minimal near-term impact and have hedged against currency risks[3].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to see a positive impact in the short term due to the strong earnings growth, operational improvements, and strategic moves. However, the negative core organic sales growth and segment-specific challenges might temper some of the enthusiasm.

**Conclusion:**
The overall performance and future outlook suggest a positive impact on the stock price, but not to the extent of a significant rally.
