The Honeywell International Inc. Q1 2009 earnings transcript indicates several key points that will likely influence the stock's short-term performance:

- **Reduced EPS Outlook**: Despite delivering results in line with guidance, Honeywell reduced its full-year EPS outlook to $2.85 to $3.20, which is a significant adjustment and could negatively impact investor sentiment.
- **Challenging Market Conditions**: The company faces tough end markets, particularly in commercial aerospace, transportation, and certain segments of Automation and Control Solutions, which will continue to impact sales and profitability.
- **Cost Savings and Restructuring**: Honeywell has initiated significant cost-cutting measures and restructuring projects, which are expected to provide benefits primarily in the second half of the year. However, these actions may not immediately mitigate the current market challenges.
- **Stimulus Package Impact**: While there is some optimism about stimulus package-driven orders in the second half of 2009 and into 2010, this is still uncertain and not factored into current guidance.
- **Pension Headwinds**: The company faces a significant pension expense headwind in 2010, which could further pressure earnings.

Given these factors, the short-term outlook for Honeywell's stock is likely to be negative due to the reduced EPS guidance, ongoing challenging market conditions, and the time lag before the full benefits of cost savings and restructuring are realized.
