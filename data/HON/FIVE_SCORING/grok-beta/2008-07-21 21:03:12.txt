Honeywell's Q2 2008 results and forward guidance appear generally positive, with strong sales growth, record EPS, and raised full-year guidance. Management's confidence, focus on restructuring, and strategic growth in emerging markets, along with robust performance in key segments like aerospace and ACS, should support short-term stock price stability or slight growth. However, external pressures from a tougher economic environment could temper investor enthusiasm. Thus, I expect a short-term positive impact, though moderated by external economic headwinds.
