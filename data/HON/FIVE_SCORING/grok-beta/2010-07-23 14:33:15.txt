Honeywell International's Q2 2010 earnings call indicates a strong outlook with better-than-expected sales, impressive margin growth, and raised guidance for sales, earnings, and free cash flow for the year. Management's proactive approach to cost-cutting, focus on new growth areas like Energy Efficiency/Smart Grid, and robustness in both short and long-cycle businesses suggest a positive momentum. Given the strong operational performance and ongoing growth initiatives, a short-term positive impact on stock price is anticipated.
