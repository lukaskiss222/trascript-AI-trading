Honeywell International presented a robust third quarter for 2015 with a good execution and segment margin expansions despite an uncertain global economic environment. Strategic acquisitions like Elster and favorable developments like the Global Xpress satellite launch suggest optimism and growth catalysts. However, challenges in the oil and gas sector, as well as in commercial vehicle production and energy retrofits, provide a headwind for parts of their portfolio. Given the operational outperformance and conservative guidance, the stock might see a short-term positive reaction, but the mixed bag of business segmentation suggests a cautious optimism.
