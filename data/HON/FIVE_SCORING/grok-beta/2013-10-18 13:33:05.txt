Honeywell's Q3 earnings call highlighted both strengths and challenges: a record sales increase with double-digit EPS growth, but also visible headwinds in the defense sector due to delayed shipments and market adjustments. The positive aspects include strong margin expansion, confident forecasts for 2014, and beneficial strategies like cost-saving initiatives and long-cycle backlog growth. Concerns arise with lower defense sales and the macro environment. Given the dominance of positive indicators in the short term (next 1â€“2 weeks), especially with raised EPS guidance and ongoing restructuring efforts, the stock is likely to experience a modest uptick.
