Honeywell's 2008 Q4 earnings reveal a resilient performance with notable EPS growth and improved free cash flow conversion. However, the company anticipates near-term challenges in 2009, expecting a significant sales and EPS decline due to a tough economic environment, particularly impacting Aero, ACS, and the semiconductor industry. Despite this, strategic initiatives like HOS, FT, and a robust backlog in defense and space are set to support the second half of 2009. The stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure.
