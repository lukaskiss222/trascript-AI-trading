Honeywell International Inc.'s strong Q1 earnings exceeded expectations with an EPS of $0.85, slightly above the high end of their previous guidance. The company raised its annual sales guidance and tightened its EPS outlook, reflecting robust performance across all segments, strong contract wins particularly in Aerospace, and confidence in future growth despite economic challenges. These factors suggest a positive short-term stock price movement.
