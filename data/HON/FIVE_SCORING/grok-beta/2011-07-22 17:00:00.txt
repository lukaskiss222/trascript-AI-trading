Honeywell's Q2 2011 earnings demonstrated strong operational performance with sales up 15%, segment profit up 20%, EPS increasing 40% from last year, and raised guidance for the year, all of which suggest potential positive momentum in sales and earnings. However, the company's focus on commercial aerospace aftermarket and investments in R&D could drive long-term growth, but the immediate share price reaction might be tempered by bookings in the Defense & Space segment remaining flat and expectations of lower growth in the second half. The announcement of divestitures like the sale of Rank Group, which will close in Q3, means the EPS will be positively affected by further reducing share count but with dilution from acquisitions and a reduced margin forecast for the rest of the year.
