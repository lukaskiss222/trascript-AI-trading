Honeywell's Q4 and full-year earnings report for 2010 highlight a robust performance, surpassing expectations with strong revenue growth, record segment margins, and cash flow. However, the positive impact on the stock could be tempered by several factors: the sale of CPG, which although strategically beneficial, introduces a short-term EPS dilution; potential defense budget cuts affecting future sales; and ongoing raw material cost uncertainties. Management's focus on growth investments and cost control, alongside an optimistic 20%+ earnings growth forecast for 2011, might instill confidence among investors. 

The stock is expected to experience a slight positive bump due to the year-end strong performance and the companyâ€™s optimistic outlook, but the short-term positive impact might not be as pronounced due to uncertainties regarding defense contracts and the recent acquisition-related expenses.
