Based on Honeywell's Q2 2012 earnings call, the stock is likely to perform positively in the short-term due to several factors:

- **Revenue and Earnings Growth**: Honeywell reported a solid earnings increase and higher-than-expected EPS for the quarter. An earnings beat often leads to a positive stock movement.

- **Strong Cash Flow**: The company’s focus on cash flow generation stood out, with over $1 billion in free cash flow despite downturns in some sectors, signaling financial health and the ability to invest in growth.

- **Stable Long-Cycle Performance**: Long-cycle businesses like Commercial Aerospace and UOP are performing strongly, providing stability and future earnings visibility.

- **Cost Management**: Management’s focus on margin expansion through cost controls and proactive restructuring measures bodes well for future profitability.

- **Raised Guidance**: The company raised the low end of its 2012 EPS guidance, reflecting confidence in its business model's ability to navigate through current macroeconomic headwinds.

- **Diversified Portfolio**: Honeywell's diverse geographical and product mix helps mitigate sector-specific challenges and provides a solid platform to weather economic headwinds.

Therefore, given these positive signals, Honeywell International Inc.'s stock should experience a positive impact over the next 1-2 weeks.
