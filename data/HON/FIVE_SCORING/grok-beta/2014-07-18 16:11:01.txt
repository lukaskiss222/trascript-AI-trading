Honeywell's Q2 earnings exceeded expectations, with strong margin expansion, a better-than-expected performance in Intermec, and raised EPS guidance that reflects positive market and internal execution. Despite this, potential concerns include uncertainties around defense market demand, seasonal volatility in UOP sales, and a less forthcoming discussion on M&A, which slightly tempers the immediate stock impact. Overall, the company's performance and outlook suggest a solid short-term positivity on stock performance.
