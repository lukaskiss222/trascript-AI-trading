Honeywell's strong fourth quarter and full-year 2013 results, highlighted by an 8% sales growth and impressive margin expansion across all business segments, suggest a positive short-term outlook for the stock. Key positive signals include optimism about future growth, significant restructuring benefits into 2014 and beyond, and proactive environmental charge management. However, uncertainties in the U.S. defense budget and potential headwinds in the first quarter from advanced materials margin rate moderation could temper immediate enthusiasm. Overall, the company's guidance for steady EPS growth and strategic M&A activity point toward a favorable near-term stock performance.
