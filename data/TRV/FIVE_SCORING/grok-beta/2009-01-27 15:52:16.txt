The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported an operating ROE of 12.4% for Q4 2008, with a detailed focus on managing risk in a challenging economic environment. Strategic expansions and increases in new business opportunities suggest potential for long-term growth. However, the stock may face a slight dip due to the U.S. economy's performance and Travelers' aggressive stance which could dampen short-term investor sentiment.
