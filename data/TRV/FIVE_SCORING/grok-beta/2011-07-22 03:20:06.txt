Travelers' Q2 2011 earnings call revealed that while the company experienced significant catastrophe losses from tornadoes and hailstorms (approximately $1.1 billion after-tax), the underlying performance of their business segments showed resilience. However, the focus on improving pricing and terms particularly in regions prone to such weather events could exert short-term pressure on policy retention and new business volumes. Managementâ€™s guidance for the second half of the year and the discussion on workers' compensation indicates cautious optimism, but the immediate aftermath of these large-scale losses might lead to a more conservative stock market response in the short term due to concerns over future earnings impacts and pricing strategy effectiveness.
