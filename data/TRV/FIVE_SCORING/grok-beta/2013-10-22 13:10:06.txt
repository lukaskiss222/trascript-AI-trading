Travelers reported a strong Q3 2013 earnings with a record operating income per diluted share of $2.35 and a low combined ratio, benefiting from low weather-related losses. However, while there are concerns about future weather volatility and low interest rates, the company's strategic actions like cost reduction and share repurchases suggest a focus on maintaining profitability. Management remains confident about continuing to raise rates in their commercial lines, which should mitigate potential short-term headwinds. Overall, these positive results and proactive measures should generally support a slight increase in stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
