Travelers Companies, Inc., exhibited strong financial performance with record net income and consistent performance, excellent capital management, and improved profitability metrics for 2009.

However, concerns include the persistent low investment yields and modest loss trend deterioration, which could temper investor enthusiasm in the near term.
