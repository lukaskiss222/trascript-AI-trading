Travelers Companies reported strong 2013 results with significant enhancements in profitability metrics and continued emphasis on disciplined pricing to improve returns. Notably, the company has achieved meaningful rate increases across its poorer performing segments, suggesting short-term stability for stock performance due to enhanced pricing discipline and expected earnings growth. However, the acquisitions and investment income comments hint at potential volatility from market and regulatory changes that may influence investor confidence in the very near term.
