Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess Travelers had a positive quarter despite Hurricane Sandy impacts. Key positives include:

1. Strong pricing momentum with business insurance rates up 8% and retention stable
2. Underlying combined ratio improvements across segments
3. Continued favorable reserve development 
4. Strong capital position with $2B+ in holding company liquidity
5. Management confidence in pricing strategy and ability to achieve improved returns

However, there are some offsetting factors:
- Significant Sandy losses ($370M after-tax in Personal Insurance)
- Ongoing low interest rate headwinds impacting investment income
- Some continued severity pressures in Auto insurance

On balance, given the strong core fundamentals, pricing power, and management's confident tone despite Sandy impacts, I expect a modestly positive stock reaction in the next 1-2 weeks.
