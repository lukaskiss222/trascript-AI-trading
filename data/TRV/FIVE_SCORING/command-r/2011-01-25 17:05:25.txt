The Travelers Companies' recent earnings call revealed solid financial performance in 2010 and a cautious optimistic tone for 2011. While cat losses and reserve development impacted the bottom line, the company still achieved an impressive 12.5% operating ROE. Encouragingly, signs of market improvement in Business Insurance emerged, with exposure changes turning positive and renewal pricing beginning to gain traction. The Personal Insurance segment also performed well, with expanded margins and increased policies. Travelersâ€™ strong capital position enables substantial shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. The potential impact of municipal bond volatility on the investment portfolio is a concern, but Travelers' high-quality holdings and diversification strategies mitigate the risk. Overall, the stock is likely to remain stable in the short term [-1].
