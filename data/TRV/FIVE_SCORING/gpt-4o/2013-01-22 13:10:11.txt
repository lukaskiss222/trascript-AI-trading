Travelers reported strong financial results for Q4 and full-year 2012 despite significant losses from Storm Sandy. Their effective management of catastrophe impacts, particularly with a quick claims resolution process, was positively noted. The company saw meaningful price gains and an increasing rate trend that exceeded loss cost trends, indicating improving margins. Despite short-term pressures from storm-related claims, effective capital management and optimistic guidance suggest a stable near-term performance with slight positive market reception likely as investors recognize resilience in their operations and strategy.
