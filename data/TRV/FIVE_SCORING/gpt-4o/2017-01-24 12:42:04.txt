The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year, featuring record net and operating earnings per share. The company demonstrated solid underwriting performance, driven by favorable prior year reserve developments, and maintained a high operating return on equity. However, concerns were raised regarding the personal auto insurance segment, where bodily injury losses exceeded expectations, prompting necessary rate adjustments and other corrective actions. Despite these challenges, the overall tone was positive, with management expressing confidence in their strategic adjustments and positioning for 2017. The market will likely react favorably in the short term due to the company's strong overall performance and proactive management responses.
