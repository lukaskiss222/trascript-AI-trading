Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong Q4 2023 results, with record core income and ROE driven by robust underwriting, lower catastrophe losses, and investment returns. Management highlighted a 13% growth in net written premiums, alongside impressive underwriting gains across all segments, particularly in Business Insurance and Personal Insurance. Despite the favorable report, the market's reaction could be moderated by mentions of ongoing challenges like medical inflation in workers' comp and pressures in certain lines such as public D&O. Overall, the positive tone and financial performance suggest a likely short-term positive impact on the stock.
