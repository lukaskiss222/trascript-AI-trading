Travelers Companies reported strong underlying fundamentals, including a 12.5% return on equity and an 11% increase in book value per share for 2010. The company showed resilience in a challenging market and demonstrated strategic management of its investment portfolio and capital, including significant share repurchases. However, there are some challenges ahead with a complex municipal bond environment and the expectation of modest loss ratio increases in 2011. Short-term stock impact is likely neutral, given these mixed elements and slightly positive pricing trends in business insurance.
