The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong Q4 and full-year 2007 results, with operating income of $4.5 billion and an operating return on equity of nearly 18%. The company's management expressed optimism about its performance and provided detailed disclosures on its sub-prime and commercial mortgage-backed securities exposure, which appears to be negligible. Travelers' guidance for 2008 assumes a somewhat more challenging investment environment and a 1% increase in the underlying combined ratio due to a continuation of the competitive underwriting environment. The stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term due to the company's strong financial position, disciplined underwriting, and commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
