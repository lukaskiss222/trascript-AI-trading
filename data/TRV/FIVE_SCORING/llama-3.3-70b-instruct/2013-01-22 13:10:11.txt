The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong financial and operational results for both the full year and the quarter, despite being impacted by Storm Sandy. The company achieved record annual sales and operating income, with a strong combined ratio improvement. The management's tone is optimistic, with a focus on executing their pricing strategy, managing catastrophic risks, and improving underwriting margins. Given the company's solid results and strong capital position, I predict a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
