The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong Q1 results, with net income of $806 million and a return on equity of 13.1%. The company's underwriting results were solid, with a combined ratio of 92.2%, and management is committed to improving profitability through selective price increases and improved terms and conditions. While the company's new business levels were somewhat lower than expected, management attributes this to their deliberate strategy of prioritizing profitability over volume. The company's dividend increase and share repurchase program demonstrate its commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders.
