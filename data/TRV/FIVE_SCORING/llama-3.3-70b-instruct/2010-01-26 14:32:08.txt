The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported record net income and net operating income per diluted share for the fourth quarter, with a return on equity of 13.5% for the year. The company's guidance for 2010 includes a projected operating return on equity of approximately 11%, with fully diluted operating income per share in the range of $5.20 to $5.55. The main factors driving the guidance are the assumption of cat losses, no estimates of prior year reserve development, and share repurchases in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. Management expressed satisfaction with the company's performance but noted that the current investment yield environment and loss cost trends may impact future returns. The company will continue to focus on returning excess capital to shareholders and managing risk in a disciplined manner.
