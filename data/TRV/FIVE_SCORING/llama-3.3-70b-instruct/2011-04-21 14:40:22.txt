The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported a strong first quarter with operating income up 31% from the prior year quarter, driven by lower catastrophe losses and solid underwriting and investment income. The company's operating return on equity for the quarter was 14.1%, and book value per share increased 2% in the current quarter. Management's tone was optimistic, with a focus on executing their strategy and improving returns. The guidance for the year remains unchanged, with an expectation of $715M-$836M in sales and $4.55-$5.05 in EPS. Given the solid earnings report and management's positive tone, I expect the stock to experience a positive impact in the short term.
