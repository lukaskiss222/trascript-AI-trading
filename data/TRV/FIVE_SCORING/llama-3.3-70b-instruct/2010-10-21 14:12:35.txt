The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong Q3 results, with net income of $2.11 per share and operating income of $1.81 per share, representing a 12% increase over last year. The company's GAAP combined ratio was 19.6%, and investment returns remained reduced due to low interest rates. Management expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, citing solid underwriting results, a high-quality investment portfolio, and progress in growing its business organically. The company also updated its guidance for full-year 2010, increasing its expected operating income per share to a range of $5.75 to $5.95.

Given the strong Q3 results, improved guidance, and management's positive tone, I predict a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
