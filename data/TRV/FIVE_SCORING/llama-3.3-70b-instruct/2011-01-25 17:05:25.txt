The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported a strong fourth quarter and full-year 2010 results, with operating income of $864 million and $4.3 billion, respectively. The company's operating return on equity was 12.5% for the full year, and book value per share grew 11%. Travelers also announced a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, in addition to the $1.5 billion remaining under the previous authorization. Management expressed optimism about the company's prospects, particularly in Personal Insurance, where they saw record earned premium and policies in force. However, they also noted that the operating environment remains complex, with loss cost trends and pricing being closely watched.

The company's CEO, Jay Fishman, highlighted the strength of the Travelers' franchise and its ability to select and manage risk, which has enabled the company to deliver consistent top-tier performance over the years. He also emphasized the importance of risk selection and the company's investments in talent and infrastructure.

The stock is likely to react positively to the earnings report, given the company's strong financial performance and optimistic outlook. The new share repurchase authorization and the company's history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks are also likely to support the stock price.
