The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong Q2 results, with record net income per share of $2.41, driven by successful execution of their pricing strategy in commercial lines. The company's aggregate rate and retention data demonstrate the success of this strategy, with a strong underlying combined ratio improvement in commercial businesses. Management remains focused on improving returns through maximizing the rate and retention trade-off at a granular level. The company also announced a strategic acquisition of Dominion of Canada, which will provide meaningful scale and market position in Canada. 

Given the strong Q2 results, successful execution of the pricing strategy, and the strategic acquisition, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term. The company's ability to improve profitability through higher pricing and its strong position in the market are key factors supporting this outlook.
