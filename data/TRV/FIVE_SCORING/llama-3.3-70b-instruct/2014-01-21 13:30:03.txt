The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong Q4 and full-year 2013 results, with record earnings per diluted share and an operating return on equity of 15.5%. The company's underlying underwriting margins improved significantly over the past two years, driven by thoughtful price increases and favorable prior year reserve development. Management expressed confidence in their ability to continue executing their strategy, focusing on returns rather than just the headline rate number. They also highlighted the importance of examining the detail behind aggregate results to understand the impact of rate and retention on returns. 

The company's Business Insurance segment had a strong fourth quarter, with an underlying combined ratio of 91.5%, and they expect to continue improving returns in their poorer performing accounts. The Personal Insurance segment also performed well, driven by lower catastrophe losses and improvement in underlying Auto and Homeowners results. 

Regarding growth, Travelers is focused on leveraging competitive advantages and strategic initiatives to grow their Business Insurance segment, rather than trying to grow through price cuts. They also expect their Quantum 2.0 product to contribute to growth in their Personal Insurance segment. 

Overall, the company's strong results and confident outlook suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
