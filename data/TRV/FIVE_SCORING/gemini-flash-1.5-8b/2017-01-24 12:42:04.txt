The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong Q4 2016 results, exceeding expectations with record EPS.  However, significant deterioration in personal auto insurance, driven by higher-than-expected bodily injury claims, is a key concern.  Management anticipates addressing this issue through rate increases, but the full impact may not be seen for 18-24 months.  This negative trend in personal auto could negatively impact the stock as investors assess the short-term and long-term implications.
