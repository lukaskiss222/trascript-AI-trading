The Travelers Companies earnings call highlighted strong performance in commercial insurance, driven by significant rate increases and improved retention.  Management expressed confidence in continued margin expansion in the first half of 2012. However, weather-related losses and a challenging investment environment continue to be concerns, notably in personal auto and homeowners.  The company is projecting continued rate increases and operational improvements without a significant shift in strategy.
