The Travelers Companies earnings call highlighted strong first-quarter results, driven by higher underwriting income and record net earned premiums.  Management emphasized disciplined expense management and positive renewal premium change, particularly in commercial insurance.  While catastrophe losses were significant, strong prior year reserve development and improved investment income partially offset this.  The overall outlook appears positive for the remaining quarters of 2018, with continued dividend increases anticipated.
