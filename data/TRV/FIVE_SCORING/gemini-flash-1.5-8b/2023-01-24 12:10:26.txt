The Travelers earnings call shows strong performance across commercial segments, with record net earned premiums and excellent combined ratios.  Personal Insurance, however, faced elevated loss pressures, leading to a higher combined ratio.  Management's outlook is positive, highlighting strong pricing and retention in commercial lines, and anticipating continued increases in renewal premium change.  The impact on the stock over the next couple of weeks is likely to depend on the market's reaction to the slightly elevated loss concerns in the Personal segment.
