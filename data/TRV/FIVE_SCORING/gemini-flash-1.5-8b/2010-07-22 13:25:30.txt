The Travelers Companies reported Q2 2010 earnings slightly below consensus, primarily due to significant weather-related catastrophe losses exceeding prior expectations.  While favorable reserve development and strong performance in personal insurance offset some of the impact, the company's updated guidance reflects a lower full-year operating income outlook, potentially due to slower-than-expected commercial renewal premium increases driven by economic headwinds.  The management commentary suggests a cautious tone, acknowledging the difficulty of pricing in a challenging economic environment.
