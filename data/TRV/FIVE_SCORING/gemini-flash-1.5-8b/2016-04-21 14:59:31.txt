The Travelers Companies reported strong first-quarter results, exceeding expectations across most business segments.  Despite higher-than-expected catastrophe losses, robust underwriting results and retention rates, particularly in commercial lines,  offset the impact.  The company's focus on individual account management and pricing strategy, coupled with stability in the commercial pricing environment position the stock for a short-term positive impact.
