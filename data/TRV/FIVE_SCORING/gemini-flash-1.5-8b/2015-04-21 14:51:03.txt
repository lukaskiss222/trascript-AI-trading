The Travelers' earnings call highlighted a strong first quarter 2015, despite a lower operating income compared to 2014.  The decrease was primarily due to lower net investment income, a prior year benefit, and reduced favorable reserve development.  Management emphasized stable underwriting results and record retention, but cautioned about the impact of volatile weather patterns and historically low fixed income returns.  These factors will likely influence investor sentiment in the near term, with a potential for moderate stock price fluctuation.
