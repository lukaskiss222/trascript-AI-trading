The Travelers Companies earnings call highlights continued challenges in the commercial liability market, particularly with general and commercial auto, necessitating increased loss reserves.  While premium growth remains strong, the elevated loss expenses suggest pressure on profitability in the short term. Management's focus on pricing and risk selection, complemented by strong retention, indicates a strategy to mitigate these headwinds.  However,  uncertainties surrounding the tort environment and ongoing weather-related losses pose short-term risks to stock performance.
