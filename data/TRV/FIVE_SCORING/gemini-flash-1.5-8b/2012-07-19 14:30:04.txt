The Travelers Companies reported solid Q2 2012 earnings, exceeding expectations on underwriting profitability despite higher-than-expected catastrophe losses.  Management highlighted substantial rate increases across all segments, particularly in personal lines (Auto and Homeowners).  The company's commitment to selectively increasing rates, combined with explicit acknowledgment of potential difficulty in reaching mid-teens ROE targets due to current economic conditions, suggests a cautious and strategic approach to managing investor expectations.
