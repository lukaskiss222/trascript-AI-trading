The Travelers earnings call highlights continued strong performance in personal lines, particularly in homeowners and agency auto, with positive renewal premium change and high retention. However, significant bodily injury severity in personal auto, impacting underwriting results, is a key concern.  Management anticipates this trend continues, requiring pricing adjustments to maintain target returns.  The stock may see short-term pressure from the higher severity, but the overall positive guidance and capital return strategy may temper negative sentiment.
