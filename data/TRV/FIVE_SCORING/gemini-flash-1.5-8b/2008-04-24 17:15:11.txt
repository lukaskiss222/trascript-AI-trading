Travelers' Q1 2008 earnings show strong operating income and book value growth, but with some market headwinds.  The company's revised guidance for 2008 reflects a slightly higher combined ratio due to increased non-catastrophe weather-related losses and anticipated softer investment income.  Management's focus on rate increases and ongoing diversification efforts, particularly in the personal and commercial lines, suggests a proactive approach to the current market conditions, implying a potential short-term stock performance that remains positive despite the guidance revision.
