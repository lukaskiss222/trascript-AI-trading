The Travelers Companies' Q2 2017 earnings show strong commercial underwriting performance and investment income despite significant catastrophe and weather-related losses in personal insurance.  While management acknowledges the high level of weather losses as being within expected ranges, the Q2 results are likely to be viewed as mixed by investors. The stock might experience short-term volatility due to the impact of these weather losses on the personal lines segment and the lower-than-expected reserve development, particularly in Bond & Specialty.
