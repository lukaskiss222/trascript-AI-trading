The Travelers Companies earnings transcript indicates strong underwriting profitability, driven by higher premiums and improved combined ratios across most segments.  The company reported significant capital returns to shareholders and a healthy balance sheet. However, catastrophe losses and higher severity in the Personal Insurance segment (particularly personal auto) impacted results.  Management anticipates a continued strong pricing environment, but also acknowledges the potential for some rate convergence with loss costs in the future.
