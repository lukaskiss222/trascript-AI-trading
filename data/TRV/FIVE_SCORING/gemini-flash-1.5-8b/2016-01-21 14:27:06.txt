The Travelers Companies earnings call highlights strong underwriting results, particularly in Bond & Specialty Insurance, despite lower investment income due to low interest rates and energy market volatility. Management expressed confidence in the company's strategy and ability to adapt to industry changes, including increased competition.  Share buybacks will align with earnings, and future rate increases will be strategically managed, focusing on retention and granular account analysis.
