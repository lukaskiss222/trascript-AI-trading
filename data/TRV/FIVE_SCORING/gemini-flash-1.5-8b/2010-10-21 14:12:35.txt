Travelers' Q3 2010 earnings call highlighted strong underwriting results and favorable reserve development, particularly in DI and FPII, offsetting reduced investment income due to low interest rates.  Management expressed confidence in the company's execution and its ability to achieve mid-teens ROE in the long term, despite current market constraints.  The call, however, indicated that the company is prioritizing retention over aggressive growth and actively managing its investment portfolio.
