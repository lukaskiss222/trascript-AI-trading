The Travelers earnings call highlights strong Q1 2019 results, with significant improvements in underwriting profitability and premium growth.  Management commentary emphasizes pricing increases across multiple segments, particularly Commercial Auto and Property, as well as continued focus on productivity and efficiency initiatives.  While acknowledging some pressure from elevated non-weather water losses, particularly in the Personal Homeowners segment, the overall positive performance and strategic outlook for the remainder of the year suggest a potentially positive impact on stock price.
