The Travelers Companies' earnings call highlights robust financial performance in 2013, driven by improved underwriting margins and favorable reserve development.  Management emphasized a granular approach to pricing, targeting specific accounts and product lines for improvement, and expects future gains to come from retention improvements rather than substantial rate increases given prevailing market conditions.  This suggests a continued focus on profitability and disciplined capital management, potentially leading to a slower pace of quarterly rate increases.
