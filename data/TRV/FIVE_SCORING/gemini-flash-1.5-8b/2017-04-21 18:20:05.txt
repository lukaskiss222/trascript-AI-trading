The Travelers Companies earnings call highlighted strong underwriting performance despite significant catastrophe losses in Q1 2017.  Management emphasized favorable loss trends excluding catastrophes, and growth in key segments like Personal Homeowners.  The acquisition of Simply Business, while impacting short-term capital management, is presented as a long-term strategic move to enhance digital capabilities and expand in the UK.  A potential short-term stock impact is less clear; any positive factors might be overshadowed by the significant and unusual Q1 catastrophe damage.
