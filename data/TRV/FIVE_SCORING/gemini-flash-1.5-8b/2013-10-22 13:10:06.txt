Travelers' Q3 2013 earnings were strong, exceeding expectations with record operating income and a high operating return on equity.  Management highlighted continued underwriting improvements, lower-than-expected weather-related losses, and strong capital return strategies, including dividends and share buybacks. However, management also noted a trend of increased weather severity and frequency, which could impact future losses. The stock is likely to rally in the short-term from the strong results.
