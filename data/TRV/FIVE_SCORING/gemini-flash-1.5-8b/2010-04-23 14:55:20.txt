The Travelers Companies earnings call highlights strong performance despite significant catastrophe losses.  Management reaffirmed full-year guidance, indicating underlying business strength and favorable prior year reserve development offsetting the substantial losses from recent storms and the Chilean earthquake.  This suggests potential for a short-term positive response to investors due to the resilience of the business, though short term volatility is possible due to the nature of the quarter's losses.
