Travelers' Q2 2011 earnings were significantly impacted by unprecedented tornado and hailstorms, resulting in a substantial after-tax catastrophe loss well outside of historical norms.  While management stressed the need for prudent pricing and risk management going forward, positive trends in Business Insurance, particularly in rate improvement and exposure growth, suggest underlying strength in the company's core business amid broader market improvements.  The short-term impact on the stock is likely to be temporarily negative due to the extraordinary catastrophe losses, but the long-term outlook remains positive.
