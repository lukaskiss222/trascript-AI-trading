Travelers reported strong first-quarter results, including the highest operating income per share since its IPO, an increased dividend, and improved underwriting margins across all segments. The company's disciplined pricing and underwriting actions are yielding positive results, and returning excess capital to shareholders signals confidence in future performance. These factors are likely to positively influence the stock price in the short term.
