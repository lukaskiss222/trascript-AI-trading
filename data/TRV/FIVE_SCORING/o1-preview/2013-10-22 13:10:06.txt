Travelers reported strong financial results, including record quarterly operating income per diluted share and a 15.2% operating return on equity. Management's positive tone, the announcement of a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, and the launch of the Quantum 2.0 product suggest confidence in future performance. These factors are likely to have a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
