Travelers reported strong second-quarter results, including record net income per share and significant improvements in their combined ratio, reflecting successful execution of their pricing strategy. Management's positive tone, expense reduction initiatives in Personal Insurance, and strategic acquisition of Dominion of Canada suggest confidence in continued performance improvement. Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the short term.
