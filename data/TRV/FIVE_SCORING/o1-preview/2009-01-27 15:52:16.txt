Travelers reported strong financial results with an operating return on equity of 12.4%, showing resilience amid economic challenges. Management's confidence was evident through a planned $1 billion share repurchase and positive guidance for 2009, with expectations of a 10-11% return on equity. High retention rates and improving pricing trends suggest the company is well-positioned, likely leading to a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
