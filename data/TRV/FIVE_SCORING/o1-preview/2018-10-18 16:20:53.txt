Travelers Companies reported strong quarterly earnings with significant growth in net income and ROE, driven by lower catastrophe losses, higher investment income, and tax benefits. Management emphasized premium growth across all segments, improved expense ratios, and positive developments in personal auto profitability. Despite some concerns like increased asbestos reserves and elevated non-catastrophe weather losses, the overall positive results suggest a likely short-term positive impact on the stock price.
