Travelers reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year earnings with record net income and operating earnings per share, driven by solid underwriting and investment results. However, higher than expected losses in personal auto insurance due to increased bodily injury claims have raised concerns, though management is taking actions to address profitability. The strong performance in other segments may offset these concerns, leading to a neutral short-term impact on the stock.
