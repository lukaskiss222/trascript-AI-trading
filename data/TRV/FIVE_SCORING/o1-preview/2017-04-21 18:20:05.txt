Travelers reported solid underlying results despite higher catastrophe losses and the impact of the Ogden rate adjustment. Strong underwriting performance, increased net written premiums, and growth in investment income demonstrate the company's resilience. Additionally, management's confidence is highlighted by the 7.5% dividend increase and the $5 billion share repurchase authorization. These factors suggest a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
