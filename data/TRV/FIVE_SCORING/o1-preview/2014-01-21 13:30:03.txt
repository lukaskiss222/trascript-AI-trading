Travelers reported record earnings per share and robust operating returns, driven by significant improvements in underwriting margins and effective capital management strategies, including substantial share repurchases and dividends. The company's continued ability to increase rates above loss trends, coupled with positive signs of exposure growth and successful product rollouts like Quantum 2.0, reflect strong financial performance and an optimistic outlook. These factors are likely to result in a significant positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
