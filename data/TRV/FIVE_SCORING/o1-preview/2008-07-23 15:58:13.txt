Travelers reported strong second-quarter earnings, with operating income of $918 million and a 14.3% return on equity, despite challenges from lower investment income and competitive market conditions. High retention rates, disciplined underwriting, and a Moody's ratings upgrade signal confidence in their financial strength and future performance. The reaffirmation of their full-year guidance suggests positive momentum, likely leading to a short-term positive impact on the stock price.
