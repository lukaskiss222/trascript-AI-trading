**Analysis:**

The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong financial results for Q1 2008, with operating income per diluted share increasing by 4% from last year's first quarter. Despite a challenging insurance marketplace, the company achieved solid growth in net written premiums, driven by its strong product platform and depth of distribution. The company's competitive advantages, including its product breadth, scale, and position with independent agents, were highlighted as key factors contributing to its success.

Management provided guidance for the full year 2008, projecting fully-diluted operating income per share of $5.55-$5.85, which would generate an operating return on equity of approximately 13%-14%. The guidance incorporates the first quarter net favorable prior year reserve development and the 1.5-point increase in the full year underlying combined ratio, as well as assumptions of lower short-term interest rates and a more challenging environment for non-fixed income investment returns.

The company also discussed its ongoing efforts to manage costs and improve efficiency, with plans to consolidate service centers and eliminate two person line service centers. Additionally, management highlighted the company's commitment to investing in new products and technologies, such as Travelers Express and Quantum Auto, to support its agents and customers.

Overall, the company's strong financial performance and strategic initiatives suggest that it is well-positioned to continue creating shareholder value. However, the challenging insurance marketplace and potential disruptions in the financial sector may pose short-term risks to the company's performance.
