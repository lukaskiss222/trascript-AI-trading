**Analysis:**
The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported mixed results for Q1 2017, with core income of $614 million, down from $698 million in the prior year quarter. Core ROE was 10.8%, down from 12.5%. The company attributed the decline to $226 million of after-tax catastrophe losses, primarily from storms in March. Despite these losses, the company reported a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.7%. Management highlighted the company's strong execution in the marketplace, with record levels of premium written and high retention rates. The company also announced its agreement to acquire Simply Business, a technology company specializing in digital insurance for small businesses in the UK. The acquisition is expected to provide the company with important capabilities in digital commerce and R&D. The company's capital management strategy did not change, and the board declared a 7.5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.72 per share. The company also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.

**Conclusion:**
The short-term impact on the stock price of Travelers Companies, Inc. is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, given the company's strong underlying results and strategic acquisitions. The company's strong execution in the marketplace and high retention rates are encouraging, and the acquisition of Simply Business is expected to provide the company with important capabilities in digital commerce and R&D. However, the company's reported core income and core ROE were down from the prior year quarter due to catastrophe losses, which could weigh on the stock price in the short term. Additionally, the company's capital management strategy did not change, and the board's decision to increase the quarterly dividend and authorize additional share repurchases could be seen as a positive signal for investors. Overall, the company's strong execution and strategic acquisitions are likely to provide a positive impact on the stock price in the short term.
