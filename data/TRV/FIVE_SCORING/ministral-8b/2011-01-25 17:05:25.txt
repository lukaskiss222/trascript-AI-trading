The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2010, with operating return on equity of 12.5% and growth in book value per share of 11%. The company's performance was driven by favorable trends in loss cost and improvements in pricing and underwriting strategies. Management expressed optimism about the future, particularly in the Business Insurance segment, where they saw early signs of improving market conditions. However, they also noted challenges in the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment due to the sluggish economy and the impact of public and private construction spending. Overall, the company's strong performance and strategic initiatives, such as the Brazilian joint venture, suggest a positive outlook for the future.
