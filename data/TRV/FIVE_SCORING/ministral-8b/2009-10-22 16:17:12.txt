The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported a strong third quarter, with operating income of $914 million, a 14% operating return on equity, and a $1.5 billion share repurchase program. The company also increased its dividend by 10% to $0.33 a share. The results were driven by solid underwriting and improved investment performance, despite a challenging economic environment. The company expects to reach a point where premiums on a written basis could be in an improving margin position by the end of this year, but this is not likely to happen due to the rate gains achieved in business insurance being down a little from the previous pace. The company is also focusing on cost-saving measures and strategic expansions, with a target of $1 billion in revenue by 2010. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
