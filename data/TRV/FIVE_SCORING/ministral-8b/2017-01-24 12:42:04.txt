The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016, with record net and operating earnings per share. The company's underwriting results were solid, with a combined ratio of 92% for the year, driven by favorable prior year reserve developments and improved underwriting performance in business and international insurance. The company also experienced higher than expected personal auto bodily injury losses, which impacted the personal insurance combined ratio for the year. Despite these challenges, the company remains well-positioned for continued success in 2017. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
