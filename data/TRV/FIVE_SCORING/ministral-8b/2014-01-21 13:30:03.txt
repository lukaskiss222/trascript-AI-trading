Based on the earnings transcript, The Travelers Companies reported strong Q4 and full-year results, with record net income per diluted share of $2.70 and record operating income per diluted share of $2.68. The company also reported a 130 basis point improvement in its underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance (BI) compared to the prior-year quarter. The results were driven by solid investment and underwriting performance, with the recent rise in interest rates lessening the headwinds faced by the industry due to historically low interest rates. The company also reported record net written premium volume for the full year of $12.2 billion, with strong results in all three business segments. The company's strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders, through share repurchases and dividends, has worked well, with the company returning almost $27 billion to shareholders since 2006. The company also reported that it expects to return over $3.1 billion of excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in 2013. The company's capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels, with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 21.3% well within its target range. The company also reported that it expects to continue to execute its strategy of improving returns and returning capital to shareholders in 2014.
