### Analysis

The Travelers Companies, Inc. reported a strong first quarter of 2013, with notable improvements in underwriting margins and operating income. The company's combined ratio improved significantly, driven by better-than-expected loss trends in several segments. Key highlights include a 5% increase in net written premiums in Business Insurance and a 7% increase in net written premiums in Financial, Professional & International Insurance. The Personal Insurance segment also saw a 3-point improvement in the underlying combined ratio.

The company's management highlighted the importance of continued pricing actions and underwriting strategies, particularly in the face of uncertainty around weather patterns and market conditions. The focus on cost savings and capital management is evident in the $476 million returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

The analysts raised questions about the potential impact of increased minimum deductibles and the direct-to-consumer channel on new business volumes. Management acknowledged the challenges and the need to continue monitoring the situation closely. Additionally, the company's comments about the legal environment and Workers' Compensation reserves provide insights into the company's risk management strategies.

### Conclusion

The short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on the stock price is likely to be positive, given the strong financial results and the company's strategic focus on underwriting and pricing. The continued improvements in combined ratios and the management's commitment to capital management and strategic growth are likely to reassure investors. However, the uncertainty around weather patterns and market conditions may introduce some volatility in the stock price.
