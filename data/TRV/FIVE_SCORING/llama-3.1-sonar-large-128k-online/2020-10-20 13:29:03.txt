- **Asbestos Reserve Development**: Unfavorable asbestos reserve development impacted the business insurance segment.
- **Economic Uncertainty**: Continued uncertainty around the economy and COVID-19's impact on future claims and economic activity introduces some caution in the company's outlook.
- **Reinsurance Pricing**: Rising reinsurance prices could potentially impact future underwriting costs, although Travelers is less reliant on reinsurance compared to some peers.
