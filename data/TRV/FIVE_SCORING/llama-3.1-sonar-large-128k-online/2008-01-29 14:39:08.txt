### Rating
1

This rating reflects a positive impact on the stock price due to the company's solid financial results, disciplined business practices, and favorable guidance. However, it is not a "2" because the guidance for 2008 includes some cautious notes about the investment environment and market competitiveness, which might slightly temper the immediate positive reaction.
