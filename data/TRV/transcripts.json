(Operator Instructions) At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Connelly, Vice President of Investor Relations.\nMichael Connelly: Morning and welcome to The Travelers discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2007 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section. Today with me is Jay Fishman, CEO, Jay Benet, CFO, Brian McLean, Chief Operating Officer, Joseph Lacher, head of our Personal and Select businesses and Tom Kunkel, President of Bond and Financial Products, as well as other members of senior management. They will discuss the financial results of our business in the current market environment and they will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through their prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Due to the number of topics we plan to cover in our prepared remarks we will run past our normal one hour but will still leave 30 minutes for Q&A. Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplements and other materials that are available in the Investor section of our website, www.travelers.com. With that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Thank you Mike and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re very pleased with our company\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter and for the entire year. On the bottom line for the full year we posted operating income of $4.5 billion or $6.71 per diluted share with a strong operating return on equity of nearly 18%. Operating income per share increased nearly 14% over 2006. On the top line net written premiums increased 3% adjusted for the sales of Afianzadora Insurgentes and Mendota. We are pleased with this result particularly given the somewhat more competitive marketplace we faced this year. With disciplined underwriting we\u2019ve been able to grow our business profitably and that\u2019s what we will strive for again in 2008. Each of our business segments contributed to the $1.1 billion of operating income that we earned in the fourth quarter. Retentions remain and are at historically high levels and margins continue to remain strong as evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year overall combined ratios of 88.4% and 87.4% respectively. In keeping with our commitment to active capital management in the fourth quarter we repurchased $1 billion of our company\u2019s stock to bring the total amount we purchased to $4.1 billion since inception of the program in the second quarter of 2006. The Board of Directors has approved an additional $5 billion of common share repurchases bring the total remaining authorization to just under $6 billion. The company remains very well capitalized and highly liquid and our balance sheet is strong. We\u2019re well positioned for the marketplace ahead. This morning we\u2019re broadening our call to provide insight and transparency into a number of issues that may be of investor interest particularly given recent events. We\u2019ve covered our residential sub-prime exposure previously and we will update that but we\u2019re also going to provide insight into our commercial mortgage-backed securities position and our real estate owned portfolio. We\u2019re going to discuss our Directors and Officers and errors and omissions exposure to the sub-prime environment generally as this has received some attention in the press over the last few weeks. We\u2019re also going to cover our subdivision surety bond position and update you on that portfolio. In all of these areas we are pleased and comfortable with our position and will share with you our analysis of these various exposures. We think you\u2019ll be pleased with the transparency and candor of the analysis as well as the conclusions we\u2019ve reached. To make sure we cover everything Jay, Brian and Joe are going to go through the customary materials somewhat more quickly than we have in the past. From an underwriting perspective the fourth quarter was not much different from the third and we don\u2019t anticipate a meaningful change in our marketplace strategy for 2008. We do expect that the investment environment will be somewhat more challenging. Nonetheless that is all factored into the 2008 guidance we provided in our press release and Jay will have more to say about that later. With that let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jay. Page three of the webcast summarizes our fourth quarter and full year financial performance, net earned premiums increased by 2% quarter over quarter and by 3% year over year. Fourth quarter operating income exceeded $1 billion for the sixth quarter in a row and full year operating income climbed to $4.5 billion, an increase of 7% from an already highly profitable 2006. Importantly notwithstanding the very challenging investment environment that has recently hurt many banks and other large financial institutions our investment portfolio performed very well for both the quarter and the full year and it remains very healthy and well positioned. I\u2019ll speak to NII and certain components of our investment portfolio in a few minutes but I wanted to specifically point out the $6 million of after tax net realized investment gains for the quarter and the $101 million after tax net realized investment gains for the full year. These net realized investment gains include impairments of only $38 million pre tax for the fourth quarter and $70 million pre tax for the entire year. These low levels of impairments truly speak to the high quality of our portfolio.  Our weighted average diluted share count of 649 million has dropped significantly due to our share repurchase activity. We repurchased 19 million common shares in the fourth quarter at a total cost of $1 billion bringing full year share repurchases to 8.3% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the year. And since the second quarter 2006 inception of this program we\u2019ve purchased 78.8 million shares at a total cost of $4.1 billion representing 11.3% of the outstanding shares as of the beginning of that period. Given our strong operating performance and financial position we expect to complete the current $5 billion share repurchase program near the end of the first quarter of 2008 although as always we will modify our repurchase activity based upon current market conditions. And as Jay already mentioned our Board has approved an additional $5 billion multi year program under which share repurchases are expected to begin immediately after completing the current program. The information on page four speaks to many of the reasons why we feel so good about our company. Let me start by saying that our balance sheet is in terrific shape. We ended the year with almost $26 billion of common equity ex FAS 115 up 5% since the beginning of the year and book value per share ex FAS 115 up $41.23 up 14% since the beginning of the year each after $2.9 billion of share repurchases and $738 million of common stock dividends. Our capital is at or above target levels for our regulators and rating agencies and we have no current need to add to our capital base other than for normal growth which we are self-funding. We are currently under review for possible upgrade from Moody\u2019s, from whom our claim spending rating is already at an AA3 and we continue to generate significant amounts of excess capital.  Our debt to capital ratio of 19.4$ favorably compares to its 20% target and with a very low level of debt maturing in 2008 and 2009 coupled with our very strong liquidity we have the ability to self-fund all of these maturities placing us in the enviable position of being able to refinance debt in the capital markets if and when we believe market conditions are favorable. Our holding company liquidity of $1.6 billion significantly exceeds our target of one year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends by $500 million and we are not reliant on commercial paper for funding or liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio had a pre tax on realized gain of $937 million at year end 2007 and we have determined that we have immaterial exposure to ratings changes from municipal bonds insurers. We\u2019ve closely examined our exposures to sub-prime Alt-A mortgages as well as to commercial mortgage-back securities and SIV related assets and found each of them to be negligible and the rest of our real estate portfolio is well diversified and appropriately valued.  Lastly while not on this slide, I\u2019d also like to point out that our insurance reserves have continued to develop favorably as we have had net favorable prior year reserve development in each of the last eight quarters. The data provided on page five highlights several items that are contained within our consolidated operating income and GAAP combined ratios. I will make just a few comments here. Net favorable prior year reserve development was $83 million after tax in the current quarter and we made no adjustments to our asbestos or environmental reserves other than for payment activity. Current quarter catastrophe losses of $45 million mostly resulted from wild fires in California and we also experienced a favorable revision to our loss ratio estimates for the current accident year resulting in a $35 million after tax benefit in the current quarter. With that I\u2019d like to now turn the microphone over to Brian McLean.\nBrian McLean: Thanks Jay. I\u2019ll start on slide six and talk a little about the marketplace, go through the segment results for our commercial businesses and then offer some specific comments on our sub-prime exposure generally. Our commercial businesses performed very well this quarter and for that matter throughout 2007. The fundamentals of our business are very strong; margins remain strong and are consistently solid across all our markets. The renewal book has performed exceptionally well with very high retention and in general modest price declines. The new business environment has been somewhat more competitive particularly in the fourth quarter so even though we saw some softening our performance was extremely favorable. Looking at the details on slide seven you can see that retentions are very high across all the businesses, they\u2019ve been consistently strong and we had improved retentions across the board in the quarter. These levels reflect our strategy to leverage our excellent margins and keep the profitable business we have on our books. We believe these high retentions clearly reflect the value of our franchise to our agents and our customers and have not been attained at the expense of meaningful rate accommodations. This is clear from the pure rate change on the renewal book which shows a modest decline. Comparing rate change in the fourth quarter 2007 with fourth quarter 2006 you see that Select, our small commercial business has experience only a 2 point rate change. In addition commercial accounts has seen a 2 point rate change and remained consistent with last quarter. In our international and financial products businesses pure rate has come down but gradually. In all you can see a gradual decline in pure rate change over the past several quarters with the biggest declines being in larger account markets. On slide eight we show total renewal price change which reflects both the rate and exposure change. RPC can be more erratic due to these exposure movements but as you see our experience over the past eight quarters has been generally consistent with the pure rate trends. New business dollars are also shown on slide eight and you can see that overall 2007 was a very strong year. In almost all markets new business submissions were up dramatically from 2006, a result of the initiatives we\u2019ve discussed in previous calls including express and express plus and select and the new products offered to our industry edge initiatives. In the fourth quarter we were still seeing good flow but the number of new accounts we actually wrote as a percentage of quotes, our hit ratio, while steady through 2006 and 2007 moved down slightly in the quarter. This decline in hit ratio indicates a more competitive marketplace for new business with pricing some times at levels lower than we are willing to go. Even with this competitive environment new business pricing on the deals we did write, remain at acceptable levels and for the full year 2007 showed strong performance, with a total of $2.8 billion written in these markets. Turning to slide nine, business insurance turns in a great performance with a 4% increase in operating income in the quarter and a 15% increase for the full year. The combined ratios for both the quarter and full year were 87.8, an improvement of 3.1 points from 2006. Severity was benign this quarter again in the lower single-digits continuing the trend seen in previous quarters. As we outlined in last quarter\u2019s call frequency while continuing to decline slightly is leveling off. This quarter\u2019s results have demonstrated a continuation of that moderate trend again still within a favorable range. When we adjust our combined ratio for net favorable prior year development business insurance had a terrific full year result at 91.1 consistent with 2006.  Turning to slide 10 you see that net written premium is down 2% in business insurance this quarter due to our disciplined underwriting in the new business environment we discussed. If you look at the full year most of the markets were up year over year resulting in a 2% improvement again driven largely by the strong retention and the impact of our initiatives in products and analytics.  Looking at slide 11 the financial, professional and international insurance segment continued to produce positive results with operating income of 5% from the same quarter last year, full year results showed an 11% increase. The combined ratio improved 5.1 points quarter over quarter and for the full year it was 87.6 a strong result again improved over 2006. The lower portion of the slide shows net written premiums up 2% for the quarter and 4% for the full year. In bond and financial products growth in our surety business was offset by declines in management liability products. Underlying the growth in surety is our high retention of existing accounts, solid flow of new business and a credit profile that continues to get stronger. The international operations premium increase was favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates as well as solid growth in our Lloyds and Canadian businesses. We are pleased that even after adjusting for net favorable prior year development the FPII segment combined ratio for 2007 was 90.6 versus 89.4 in \u201906. In a minute I will provide comments specific to our management liability book and sub-prime environment but want to emphasize here that even after taking into account the impact of any losses or all the losses from these issues, this business continues to perform at very profitable levels. Overall in this quarter our commercial insurance businesses produced great results. The fundamentals of our business are solid, retention of our profitable book is strong and margins remain excellent. We recognize and increasingly competitive marketplace and certain underlying economic pressures however we\u2019re maintaining our focus on growth albeit in a disciplined manner and that discipline produced another terrific quarter. Now I\u2019m going to take a few minutes to talk about our management liability book of business and how we evaluate potential exposure to the sub-prime environment. On slide 12 we\u2019ve shown our management liability premium for 2007 and broken out the portion of this book by product that we estimate is exposed to this issue. You can see that we have $1.6 billion of management liability premium and have separated it into four product groups; directors and officers, fiduciary, errors and omissions and all other products. The other category contains a variety of products that are footnoted at the bottom of the page and would not directly respond to the issues created by sub-prime. In the three exposed product groups the percentage of our book that we estimate is exposed to sub-prime is relatively small primarily due to the diverse nature of the book. For example, approximately 4% of the total book is with private and non-profit accounts with negligible exposure to this issue. Additionally, we have a very industry diverse book and specifically our market position in the financial services industry is led by our community bank portfolio. These are smaller banks which so far have not been associated with the sub-prime issues and we don\u2019t currently anticipate that as a class they will. Our portfolio is not heavily weighted to larger, public company financial institutions or money center and investment banks. Overall our total exposed management liability products are less than 1% of our total company premium.  Turning to slide 13 it\u2019s important to consider specific characteristics of these products and our approach to underwriting. D&O, E&O and fiduciary products are issued on claims made policies which dramatically reduce the latency tail on the business and the ability to stack limits. Very importantly policy limits are low, between $5 million and $25 million and are weighted more heavily towards excess coverage than primary with relatively high attachment points. Specifically for the exposed D&O policies our average limit is about $8 million and 70% of the premium is excess. On these excess accounts we typically attach it over $50 million which is very important when you consider the defense costs due to this issue could be considerable. We also have a reinsurance program that further limits our exposure. On a policy level basis we see it approximately two-thirds above a $5 million retention which reduces our net exposure per loss to $12 million up to an annual aggregate of approximately $375 million. In addition we\u2019ve been proactively taking into account the sub-prime pressures throughout much of 2007 incorporating the environment into our underwriting. So considering our diverse book and the way we\u2019ve approached the market you can see that we have acted to restrict our exposure and we expect that any potential issue would be a frequency not a severity one.  If you turn to slide 14 I\u2019d like to walk you through the detailed analysis we performed to determine our potential exposure to sub-prime claims. For starters we conducted an individual account analysis on all accounts that we felt had an elevated level of exposure. The definition of what was elevated obviously began with accounts that had current reported claims or notices and I\u2019ll speak directly to them in a moment. Second we identified and individually analyzed accounts for which we had not received a claim or notice but which we determined to have a heightened risk of loss. This group was broad and included large financial institutions, sub-prime lenders, bond insurers, home builders and suppliers, as well as related accounts we saw mentioned in major financial press. For this analysis we reviewed each individual account from an actuarial claim and underwriting point of view. Our team factored in relevant circumstances of each account with particular attention to the structure of the coverage including limits and attachment points, as well as reinsurance. The result is an account by account estimate of ultimate gross and net liability. Third we performed an aggregate analysis to estimate losses not identified in the individual account analysis. In this portion of our portfolio which included accounts such as community banks, we conducted an actuarially based frequency and severity reserve analysis to understand our level of exposure. The net result of this entire process was a robust review of loss pertaining to sub-prime events for this market.  On slide 15 we provide some data from this analysis specifically regarding claims and notices as of December 31, 2007. As of the close of \u201907 we had 30 sub-prime related management liability claims. You can see in the charts that we were primary on five and excess on 25 of these policies which again is typical of our approach within the large financial institutions marketplace. As I mentioned, in general limits ranged between $5 million and $25 million and you see the average related to these claims is $11 million. Limits management is an active part of our liability underwriting strategy. So overall a limited number of claims and consistent with our overall profile. We have fully recognized these claims in our 2007 earnings results and the overall provisions in the 2007 financial statements and the 2008 guidance incorporates the results of the analysis we conducted. The estimate for sub-prime losses in 2008 guidance is not materially different from the estimated losses for 2007. After considering all of the above actions our management liability business continues to meet our return thresholds.  Our project is based on what we believe to be a realistic assessment of our exposure to the sub-prime environment but you could obviously ask could it be worse. Given that we view this as fundamentally a frequency issue, we think a material variance from our assessment would require systemic changes to the insured litigation environment expanding our exposure to segments that currently appear to have low correlation to the sub-prime environment.  Finally let me round out the conversation on our bond and management liability business by touching on our surety segment, specifically about potential exposure to residential real estate developers. Slide 16 and 17 speak to subdivision bonds which as you know provide coverage to real estate developers in the event of a financial or operational failure prevents the developer from installing improvements guaranteed by the bond. These typically include sewer, roads and sidewalks. We generally do not provide performance bonds guaranteeing the construction of individual homes. Our construction surety business is comprised largely of infrastructure and public work projects and importantly only 1% of our construction surety accounts are subdivision programs. During the past quarter we took a very close look at the potential for subdivision exposures. We have scrutinized the portfolio and evaluated the financial condition of many of our insured\u2019s, the extent to which the credits are secured and the general progress towards completion of the obligations. We then applied a series of stress scenarios assuming market conditions worse than we currently anticipate. This analysis which is outlined on slide 17 concludes that under scenarios worse than we currently anticipate we wouldn\u2019t expect losses over time to exceed approximately $100 million.  In summary we have thought in a comprehensive fashion about the evolving implications of financial sector stress on our management liability and surety industry exposures. The net conclusion of our in depth exposure analysis at year end 2007 are that the issues are very manageable for us and we\u2019re comfortable by both our diversity and profitability of business in the management liability and surety lines. Now before I turn it over to Joe for personal lines, I\u2019d like to address one more topic relating to this. Recently we\u2019ve gotten the question about how a recession would impact our security book so I\u2019d like to turn it over to Tom Kunkel who runs our bond and financial professional liability businesses to give you our response.\nTom Kunkel: Thank you Brian. That is a legitimate question so here\u2019s some perspective on our surety portfolio. Seventy-five percent of our surety premium is actually in our construction surety business. Within that construction surety industry we are seeing some slow down in the amount of privately funded construction projects. But it\u2019s important to realize that we estimate that 90% of our construction portfolio is driven by public work spending, for example, Federal, state and local funding for building and infrastructure projects. The level of public work funding is currently historically robust. We write some of the best capitalized contractors in their class and the condition of their balance sheets as well as the condition of the back log of uncompleted work continues to look very strong. And lastly it\u2019s important to realize that in the event of a contractor default, we typically do have the right to the owner\u2019s unpaid contract balance, thus mitigating our exposure under the bond. For these reasons we feel very good about the profitability in this construction surety book. We feel equally strongly about our commercial surety portfolio. Commercial surety makes up approximately 25% of our overall surety premium. Again the credit quality and underlying financial strength of this portfolio is very strong. This book is well secured and where appropriate it is collateralized. It\u2019s a very diverse portfolio and we pay very close attention to managing the underlying makeup of the individual obligations that we assume. So again, while these are very legitimate questions we feel very good about the profitability of our surety portfolio. Joe?\nJoseph Lacher : Thanks Tom. Looking at slide 18 personal insurance segment had another terrific quarter with a combined ratio of 91% in $201 million in operating earnings. It continued to deliver strong retention, renewal pricing and year over year PIP growth, both the auto and homeowners line. As you look at profitability there are several items affecting the comparability of results I\u2019d like to discuss to make the underlying results are clear. Our reported combined ratio was 12.7 points worse than the fourth quarter 2006. Adjusting for lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development and current year loss ratio re-estimation and for higher levels of catastrophe losses the difference was only a modest deterioration of 1.4 points of combined ratio.  Looking to production results on page 19 let me talk first about homeowners business. Here we continue to produce strong results despite the declines in housing sales. We\u2019ve maintained a stable retention rate of 86%, renewal price change at 8% was in line with what we\u2019ve seen in the last four quarters. Policies in force increased by 3% versus the prior year quarter. We\u2019ve been pleased with the reception and the early sales of Quantum Home in the market. Quantum Home offers industry leading product sophistication enabling us to continue to deliver profitable growth. Over the last quarter the program was implemented in six additional markets bringing our total to date to 31 states plus the District of Columbia. We\u2019re on track to roll out the remaining targeted states during 2008. We\u2019re also very pleased with the production results of our auto business. Excluding the impact of the Mendota sale net written premium and policies in force both grew 1% over the prior year quarter. Retention remained strong and stable at 83% and RPC was plus 2%. Quantum Auto now represents over a third of our country wide annualized written premium. This was the first full quarter in which Quantum Auto was available in New York which represents the final planned launch in our Quantum Auto roll out.  Page 20 shows our combined ratios for auto and homeowners. As I mentioned before several items impacting comparability need to be considered when looking at results across periods. There are three principal items. First combined ratios in the fourth quarter 2006 benefited from significantly greater favorable prior year reserve development and the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios. Second results in 2007 had significantly greater catastrophe losses than in 2006. Third there is typically a quarterly seasonality impact in auto loss ratios with the fourth quarter being the highest quarter. This results largely from weather and usage differentials. When looking at the seasonality impact the fourth quarter 2006 results were somewhat better than typical and the fourth quarter 2007 were somewhat worse. Thus when comparing the results, the bulk of the difference in combined ratios between fourth quarter 2006 and 2007 were attributable to these three items. When comparing the auto combined ratio for sequential quarters, the bulk of the difference is attributable to the seasonality issue. Please recall that renewal price changes were plus 2% for auto and plus 8% for homeowners. Clearly price reductions were not driving combined ratio changes. Let me try to wrap this all together. Although not displayed here as you look at the full year 2007 result excluding the impact of prior year reserve development and catastrophes the combined ratios for both auto and homeowners were within half a point of the prior year. This underscores that underlying results were generally consistent period over period. Turning to page 21 I\u2019d like to spend a few moments on auto loss trends. On the far right side you can see that we\u2019re seeing total loss trend in the low to mid single-digit range excluding the impact of the Quantum Auto introduction. Looking underneath this result, frequency trend drives the total loss trend. Severity is down slightly overall, this is a combination of a modest increase in physical damage severity trends and a decrease in bodily injury severity trend. I know that our bodily injury results are counter to what a number of our competitors have been disclosing; we attribute this to the continued impact of our claim initiatives on these coverages. As we flip to page 22 I\u2019d like to spend a moment on Quantum Auto\u2019s anticipated impact on our frequency. The product\u2019s broader reach to more standard drivers anticipated an increase in overall absolute frequency. Our pricing appropriately reflects this change. When we look at the chart on the left the red line shows the expected impact on the overall books frequency from Quantum. The blue line shows the actual results are generally in line with our expectations. Again we remain pleased with our results from Quantum Auto and the overall program is performing consistently with our expectations.  Wrapping it all together, we\u2019ve had another great quarter and year and look forward to carrying our success into 2008. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Joe, the chart on page 23 average invested assets grew to $75.2 billion in the quarter increasing over 3% when compared to the prior year quarter. Operating cash flows were approximately $1.4 billion in the current quarter and over $5.3 billion year to date. The average quality rating of our fixed maturity investment portfolio remains very strong at AA1 or AA+. The low investment grade securities comprise only 2.5% of the portfolio and the duration of the portfolio remained at 4. Our fourth quarter net investment income is shown on page 24 with $696 million after tax reflecting lower yields on non fixed income investments than in recent quarters. NII for the affixed income portfolio benefited from the increased invested asset basis as well as higher reinvestment rates. Overall our after tax yield was 3.7% for the quarter. In our continuing effort to be highly transparent and responsive to our investors and the analyst community we\u2019re providing detailed information about certain portions of our investment portfolio. Last week we provided detailed information about our municipal bond holdings in a Form 8-K filing and as the data indicated we estimated that the average credit rating of the portfolio would be AA+ without any of the benefits from the insurance [wrappers] as compared to an approximate AAA- including the [wrappers] due to the very strong underlying ratings of the issuers of these bonds.  We\u2019ve concluded that we have immaterial exposure to ratings changes for municipal bond insurers and for your convenience, we\u2019ve reproduced the schedules contained in that 8-K as an appendix to this webcast. Page 25 provides an update to our exposure to sub-prime and Alt-A mortgages while pages 26 and 27 which are new, provide information about all other of our real estate related holdings. Our exposure to sub-prime Alt-A mortgages remains negligible, the only change of any consequence in the quarter was that we selectively took advantage of favorable pricing to add modestly to our position increasing our total sub-prime Alt-A mortgages to $286 million or .4% of the fixed maturity portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter from $192 million or .3% at the end of the third quarter.  Our exposure to commercial mortgage-back securities is also negligible. As the data on page 26 indicates we held only $607 million of non-agency US CMBSs at year end representing less than 1% of our fixed maturity portfolio and having an average credit rating of AAA and all of these investments were acquired in 2004 and prior, well before recent increases in commercial real estate values. On page 27 we show certain information for our remaining real estate related holdings. This is a highly diverse portfolio and recent appraisals for holding on properties and joint ventures are well in excess of current carrying value. Here too we feel very comfortable with our investments and their carrying values.  The common theme in all of this is a highly disciplined approach to investing. Recognizing that as a company we take most of our risk on the liability side of the balance sheet and making sure that on the investment side we are appropriately compensated for the risks that we do take.  Pages 28 and 29 provide information about our guidance for full year 2008. We expect fully diluted operating income per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.75 generating an operating return on equity of approximately 13% to 14%. Based upon expected market conditions we are anticipation somewhat lower NII due to a more challenging investment environment particularly for non fixed income investments and a 1% increase in our underlying combined ratio due to a continuation of the somewhat more competitive underwriting environment. Our guidance assumes full year catastrophe losses of $525 million pre tax and $340 million after tax or $0.55 per share after tax which represents the average annual loss expectancy as indicated by our [cat] modeling. No prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable, growth in average invested assets in the low single-digits after approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases and weighted average diluted shares of approximately $618 million after share repurchases and employee equity awards. Finally on page 29 we have provided certain information that should help you understand the major differences between actual operating income per diluted share in 2007 and our 2008 guidance. With that let me turn the microphone back to Jay for his closing remarks before we do Q&A.\nJay Fishman: Thank you Jay. First we apologize for the length this morning but thought it was very important to go through these various topics and before we open it up for questions let me just make a couple of closing observations.  First we\u2019ve got very good positive momentum as we head into 2008 and we\u2019re optimistic about our performance. Second we\u2019re pleased with the results of the analysis that we shared with you this morning and believe that it speaks well to our size, the diversity of our business and the smart, disciplined approach that we take to underwriting and to investing. We plan on running our business with that same focus as we look to the future and with that we\u2019ll open it up for questions.\nOperator: Your first question comes from Jay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers\nJay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers: Thanks and good morning and I just wanted to say thanks again for all the increased disclosure on the sub-prime and the surety I think that helps. If I could come at that issue from another angle based on your current expectations for the sub-prime D&O and E&O and surety related components if you look back to where say we were in 2001, 2002 with the melt down in the NASDAC and [Rona WorldCom] what were your initial expectations in terms D&O and E&O related losses then versus the ultimate result. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how bad it could get relative to your expectations and then in addition to that if you could give us a sense of how high your surety combined ratio can go in a recession-type environment. I think that would be helpful for a historical perspective.\nJay Fishman: Well Jay let me start with making an observation about our expectations with respect to D&O and E&O, the management liability losses. You\u2019ve been in this industry long enough to understand that we actually write insurance and expect to have claims. And that we anticipate a level of claims in the business and we price the business accordingly. One way to think about the management liability exposure anticipated losses that we see, or anticipate at the moment, is that it\u2019s envisioned, incorporated, accommodated by if you like, the loss ratio that we would ordinarily peg against this business. We don\u2019t make an assumption that any business that we write is going to be loss-free. We make an ongoing assumption that there will be claims and there will be losses and at least there isn\u2019t anything yet in the management liability arena that would cause us to believe that there would be a dramatic difference between the ongoing expected loss performance and what we see coming out of this which is why we make the comment that says that we continue to view these businesses as operating within the return thresholds that we set. We\u2019ve spoken earlier on Investor Days about having return thresholds in our business of from 13% to 18% depending upon the business itself and even after giving affect to expected losses in this business we continue to view the returns in the business being in those ranges. So I\u2019ve got to start with the premise that says after a detailed account by account analysis it looks to us as though the expected losses will fall within the expected range of losses that we would have for this business. That may change. It may be different because of a systemic difference in the kinds of losses that come at us, but again as Brian mentioned before, it\u2019s frequency not severity.  I\u2019m looking at Tom, I don\u2019t know how to go back to 2001 and comment on expectations versus actually kind of on-the-run here. \nTom Kunkel: Yeah, on the run it\u2019s a very difficult question to answer Jay. I share you sentiments on that. \nJay Fishman: The second question I think Jay that you asked was about the surety business and I think you asked about\u2026and I\u2019m not sure whether your question is specific to the subdivision environment or the surety business more generally. First in the subdivision environment the stress test that we provided in this webcast does I think exactly as you asked us to do which is we\u2019ve assumed only those accounts that are of the strongest quality either because of their strength or their collateral position, would in affect be money good, and we\u2019ve assumed that 33% of all of the remaining accounts default and have zero recovery associated with them. That would be an awfully bad environment. Yeah I\u2019m assuming it could probably we worse but in our experience that would be, I suspect on precedence in terms of loss experience in that book, and even in that highly remote scenario we\u2019re talking about cumulative net losses which would evolve over obviously a number of years of less than $100 million and in the context of the business that\u2019s just reporting $4.5 billion in earnings, I just don\u2019t see that as anything particularly problematic when you view it as a stress case scenario.  If you look more broadly at the surety business and again going back to Tom\u2019s comments, 75% of the surety business is construction-based, 90% of it in public works projects. Importantly look at the customers that we\u2019ve been engaged with in that business and remember in the end that we have rights to the remaining contract proceeds in the unlikely event that a contractor defaults. That has happened, it certainly has happened in our book and to others as well, but fundamentally the project is collateralized by the remaining proceeds due from the municipality or the state government. So our view of looking at the construction side of the business remains pretty confident and wouldn\u2019t envision a dramatic change in losses from sort of historical experience. The commercial side is carefully underwritten. We focus on collateral and security and yeah, you know you tell me the economic environment or the level of distress that you want to place at it and sure I think losses would tick up, but again in the context of a company our size I don\u2019t think that they would become problematic. I know I\u2019m not answering your question with a level of specificity that you\u2019d like but it\u2019s virtually impossible to do so. Anything Tom that you want to add?\nTom Kunkel: I would just add that our experience in this business shows us that recessions in and of them selves don\u2019t necessarily cause surety losses. But they do tend to expose the underwriting that took place when times were good, when the economy goes into a recession and I think our position on that is that even in robust economic times our underwriting has not changed and so in a recession it\u2019s not necessarily going to follow that our losses will increase.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers: I appreciate that and then just a separate one for Jay Benet, on the investment portfolio, for the other investments, I know I\u2019ve asked this question before but what do you think is the right run rate or right investment yields for the other investments so we can model that?\nJay Benet: Yeah in the past what I\u2019ve said you know given some steadiness in the marketplace, the quarterly analysis show ups and downs but we would generally advise averaging the quarters. I would say at this point in time, given the way the markets are at least for our planning purposes, we think the fourth quarter of \u201907 is more indicative again for planning purposes, of what we would look for going forward into \u201908. \nJay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers: Do you tend to get an up tick on that in the first quarter though seasonally?\nJay Benet: I\u2019m sorry could you repeat that?\nJay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers: Is there seasonality in that result, in the quarterly result, does the first quarter tend to be stronger than say the fourth?\nWilliam Heyman: In typical times there some seasonality in distributions by private equity funds. I think we\u2019re in a climate right now in which that is not the case and not likely to be the case for a while. Also in December private equity funds often make distributions before year end.  That was not the case this December. So I think for the moment we have to take a somewhat longer term view of the portfolio, which we think as a matter of risk thresholds ought to perform over time much as public equities perform, possibly plus or minus a few points.\nJay Fishman: I think the other point, Jay, that I would add and Jay Benet did mention this but simply to reiterate it is that our guidance for 2008 assumes a somewhat lower level of net investment income than we actually realized in 2007, driven really uniquely by what we perceive to be the potential for a more challenging realization environment in the investment arena.  It\u2019s not attributable to cash flows or anything else. It\u2019s purely an issue of perceiving the realization environment to be somewhat more challenging and then the rest of the guidance is accounted for by about 100 basis points change in the ongoing run rate of the combined ratio simply to incorporate the continuation of the more competitive environment that we\u2019ve been witnessing.  We are assuming for \u201808 that that environment will continue to look very much like the change in \u201807 looked; that it will get increasingly somewhat more competitive as \u201808 moves along.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Bill Wilt - Morgan Stanley. \nBill Wilt - Morgan Stanley : Back to management liability; Brian, in your prepared remarks you rhetorically questioned, how could it be worse? You mentioned that it would be more likely frequency driven than severity. Then you went on -- and I think Jay Fishman, you also used the word systemic, there would have to be a systemic change in the litigation environment, presumably entities that you\u2019re not currently contemplating brought into this mess. Could you expand on that some?\nJay Fishman : I think your characterization is actually quite right. We, for example, do not currently see -- this isn\u2019t a conclusion that we\u2019re reaching, these are facts -- we don\u2019t currently see the small local community bank being dragged into the sub-prime issue.  Again, there are a couple that have and in our account-by-account analysis we\u2019ve incorporated that into the work. When we refer to a systemic change, we\u2019re really talking about a class of risk not currently identified in any way, not currently associated with it in some way being dragged into it.  Brian\u2019s comment about frequency versus severity is driven by our limits profile. We have low limits, relatively small limits I think compared to other people who underwrite the business, and so an individual account won\u2019t change much of anything. It would actually take a systemic change in the class of business that was associated with this and for there to be litigation which our policies would respond to.  Ultimately, there has to be litigation to the insured for our policies to respond. So that\u2019s what we think could trigger a worst case scenario, but so far there\u2019s no evidence of that.\nBill Wilt - Morgan Stanley : Are you currently contemplating defense coverage that would obviate some of these claims or policies vis-a-vis the nature of the claims you\u2019ve seen so far, are there issues or questions as to coverage?\nJay Fishman :\n : It\u2019s very important first to remember that in claims made policies defense costs are contained inside the limits unlike traditional occurrence policies where the obligation to defend run outside the limits and so the obligation to defend can simply run on, in effect forever, at least theoretically.  With claims made policies the defense costs fall inside the limits so they are very much quantifiable. To the extent that defense costs emerge, they emerge first at the primary level. Those who have the primary policy will provide defense. Of course, they will assuming that there\u2019s an indemnification obligation. Eventually it will run up the policy to where if it continues to go excess riders eventually get dragged into the defense obligation sequentially.  I think one of the things that we take some comfort in -- and it\u2019s in the analysis of the 30 claims and notice of claims that we\u2019ve got -- is that only five of them are primary, 25 of them are excess so at the moment you see the average attachment points there. One can make an assumption as to the litigation costs and all the rest. It sure feels good in this case to be an excess provider rather than a primary provider.  The limits are there and obviously if either the defense or the indemnification obligation extends through the policy then those limits will be tapped as well. But it is important to note that defense costs are inside the limits.\nBill Wilt - Morgan Stanley : The last quick one for me is if you could offer just a quick reminder of the nature of the coverages in commercial surety.\nTom Conkel : Commercial surety entails a variety of what typically used to be called miscellaneous surety bonds. They can entail anything from small mom-and-pop compliance bonds to bonds which may guarantee appeals of court judgments for larger, better secured companies.  So in the class, there are obviously a wide variety of obligations. In our underwriting we consider the nature of each of those underlying obligations and we tailor our underwriting approach to the risk of that obligation and then the financial solvency of our customer.\nJay Fishman :\n : The larger end, and this is real time, so correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but in all likelihood you\u2019ve got permit bonds, sales tax bonds and tobacco bonds and all that would be small on an individual basis. At the larger end, there might be a commercial surety bond issue for a self-insurer of workers\u2019 compensation obligations. That would be toward the larger end on a size scale of a commercial security obligation.\nTom Conkel :   That would be one of the obligations, yes, Jay, that we would write only for our larger and most financially secure accounts and one that also receives the greatest degree of underwriting.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Alain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities. \nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities : I want to thank you also for the additional disclosure. That was very helpful and very thorough. I just want to confirm that I heard correctly in terms of the share buyback, Jay. You said $900 million in the first quarter or second quarter of the whole program?\nJay Fishman :\n : Given our cash position, our expectation is that we would do about $2.7 billion for the year. That\u2019s what we included in the guidance. We would expect to finish the first program which is that $900 million somewhere near the end of the first quarter. It could be a little into the second quarter or just before. But that\u2019s the target.\nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities : International business, I realize it\u2019s a small percentage of your overall business, had 10% growth rate this quarter, 9% for the year. You mentioned foreign exchange was helpful to the top line. Could you quantify that? If the growth rate is still above the other areas, what are you seeing there that you\u2019re comfortable growing or why is it attractive and we shouldn\u2019t be concerned about growing in a softening market?\nJay Benet: First of all on the FX it\u2019s about 2 points overall in that business. That gives you a sense of that.  We see a variety of opportunities there in the international marketplace. As I said in my comments, the Lloyd\u2019s business is something where on a very selective basis -- and again at Lloyd\u2019s we are fundamentally not a long tail player -- so we\u2019re doing property-type of coverages out of Lloyd\u2019s and feel very good at what we\u2019re seeing there. So we\u2019ve seen some selected opportunities to grow there. \nJay Fishman :\n : It\u2019s important to mention, to reinforce this, that we are not a long tail casualty writer at Lloyd\u2019s. That our appetite at Lloyd\u2019s is virtually exclusive to property, to marine, to aviation, to other short tail coverage. So don\u2019t perceive in this that we\u2019ve gone out and begun writing long tail coverages in Lloyd\u2019s. Not the case.\nJay Benet:   So our opportunities in Lloyd\u2019s have been heavily focused in the marine industry, for example, some in the power generation area. The other place where we\u2019ve had a decent amount of growth and think we\u2019ve got opportunities in our Canadian franchise which historically had been very focused on a couple of products and we think we\u2019ve got an opportunity there to expand both geographically in Canada and expanding some of our product profile that we\u2019ve got in the U.S. into our Canadian operations.\nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities : The next question relates to the market environment. I\u2019m sure anecdotally there\u2019s an unreasonable competitor, but any broad unreasonableness by product line? Is there any product line or segment that you\u2019re concerned that\u2019s already not meeting your hurdle rate or concerned that in 2008 is unlikely to meet the hurdle rates?\nJay Fishman :\n : It\u2019s certainly the case that the largest end of the insurance business, largest accounts, is clearly the most competitive. The thing I think that\u2019s often misunderstood about our franchise is that that\u2019s not where we live. We are a small and middle market company. Our large account business is largely, largely a loss responsive business. There will be other companies that do guaranteed costs in the largest account segments. The commentary that you\u2019ll hear from them in the aggregate of their business is I think different from the commentary you\u2019ll hear from us.  The small and middle market segments have not nearly been as competitive as the largest guaranteed cost segments are. Again, that\u2019s not where we do business. But in terms of size, that would be the breadth.  One of the interesting dynamics, and this is highly anecdotal, is that we actually still see some softness overall in the D&O market, which actually is quite interesting given all of the questions that are coming at us this morning about management liability. That\u2019s true both on the reinsured side as well as on the primary side. The market as of yet is not, from a pricing standpoint, reacting as though there\u2019s some insurmountable crisis here that needs to have an immediately reaction in the pricing dynamic. Those would be the two I\u2019m closest to. \nJay Benet: That would be it. One quick correction because I misspoke. The 2% was on a broader portfolio. For the international business alone it was about 4 points of the growth. \nBrian MacLean: If I could just help to clarify.\nJay Benet:   Because I was thinking of the total segment number.\nBrian MacLean:   In international, you\u2019ll see in the supplement, 9% adjusted for FX will be about 4%.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Larry Greenberg - Langen Mcalenney. \nLarry Greenberg - Langen Mcalenney : I was just wondering if Joe might elaborate a little bit more on the personal auto market conditions? We heard from some companies that they are now trying to push rate up and just wondering if Joe is seeing any sort of bifurcation in the marketplace?\nJoe Lacher: Larry, we hear the same kind of comments and what we\u2019re doing is watching it. It becomes very much a local market and a local environment issue and you get a couple of companies in any one environment might move up and down a little bit. We\u2019re not seeing anything that\u2019s fundamentally causing big swings either way. We\u2019re watching it. We hear the same reports and are looking for those impacts and are anxiously awaiting to see them in the market.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen Mcalenney : Jay, as aggressively as you guys are returning capital to shareholders, you\u2019re building capital even more quickly. Has anything changed in your view or your opinion on whether you would like to be acquisitive?\nJay Fishman :   That sounds a little bit like \u201chave you stopped beating your wife?\u201d Let me try and answer the question my way.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen Mcalenney : It wasn\u2019t intended that way.\nJay Fishman :   I think it would be irresponsible for a management team to say in the broadest sense that it would never consider an acquisition. I think we have a responsibility to be thoughtful, to see how we can create shareholder value and to use all of the tools that are available to us to do that.  Having said that, our instinct about it is really no different than it was which is that the risk of any transaction is very high. There\u2019s culture risk and balance sheet risk, reserve risk, people risk, financial risk; it\u2019s significant and we recognize it. We\u2019re experienced at it and we recognize that those risks are real. Any transaction that we might evaluate will inevitably be compared to the very high hurdle of the risk assessment that we put into any transaction.  So then I go back to, can we create shareholder value? Can we complete our mission with the tools and skills and the assets that we have? The answer is we\u2019re absolutely convinced we can. So you take a transaction, you evaluate it in the context to accelerate the growth of shareholder value, again evaluating against the risk.  So I think it\u2019s all on the table, Larry. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s any different than it was three months ago or six months ago. Risks are high. They are difficult to do. We have a lot of experience doing them so we feel pretty good about it but the risks are nonetheless high.  There\u2019s nothing in our capital profile that\u2019s driven towards accumulating capital in anticipation of a transaction. We are returning capital as aggressively as we think prudent in the marketplace that we\u2019re in. To the extent that we feel comfortable doing more we will do more.  I think it would be nice to be AA straight with both agencies. We are on watch on upgrade from Moody\u2019s from AA3 to AA2. I don\u2019t know if that will occur or when. We\u2019re currently rated AA minus with Standard & Poor\u2019s I think it would be nice to be AA rated and the financial targets that Jay sets and the ways in which we measure our business are geared to doing that.  But we\u2019re not sitting on $0.05 of capital without a good reason and a good reason is not sitting on it to create a war chest for an acquisition. That\u2019s just really a silly way to run a business and we just don\u2019t do it.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan. \nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan : You talked about in the presentation some of the declines in frequency you\u2019re seeing in auto are expected based on some of the changes you\u2019re making. Is the same also true for severity that there\u2019s some impact there because of some of the underwriting changes?\nJoe Lacher:   There is a little bit of a change. It\u2019s much more modest and sometimes almost counter to what you would expect as you move deeper into some parts of the standard marketplace, you might see lower limits. In some cases we\u2019re seeing different numbers of limits is probably the easiest example to see. Lower limits you\u2019d anticipate getting some lower severities.  Again, when we described for you on page 21 loss trends, what we\u2019re doing there is describing all of those trends -- loss frequency and severity -- excluding the expected impact of the product changes. We\u2019re trying to take out that noise and the aggregate statistics so that we look at underneath is the real and appropriate numbers for financial projections, the environmental inflation that\u2019s going on and any difference between our expected numbers and the actuals.  So those two items together would roll through what you see on page 21 and give you the best set of numbers to project what our numbers or the environment were doing.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan : On the claims side, what inning are we in terms of the benefit you\u2019re getting there, just from the implementation of processes, procedures, et cetera?\nJoe Lacher:   I think we\u2019ve commented before, and it would still hold true. On the physical damage initiatives, we\u2019re most of the way through there. If we were picking an inning, maybe it\u2019s the ninth, maybe it\u2019s done. It\u2019s hard to tell exactly. But it\u2019s on the tail end. On bodily injury, it\u2019s hard to project when the end is. It\u2019s definitely in the last half of the inning. But until you really get closer to the end and see the shift change it\u2019s hard to project it. I guess seventh or eighth.\nJay Fishman :   Just to clarify on that point, because importantly when the ball game\u2019s over, to use your example, it doesn\u2019t mean that trend goes up. What it means importantly is that the expected declines or the expected benefits from that investment -- they may actually not necessarily be declines, but the expected benefits -- have now run their course and will continue to be evident in our loss trend.\nJoe Lacher:   And will continue to perform at the new and improved levels.\nJay Fishman :   That\u2019s exactly the point.\nJoe Lacher:   And we will experience whatever environmental inflation there is, whether it\u2019s up or down.\nJay Fishman :   That\u2019s exactly right.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan : I just wanted to get to the gravy, so to speak. The other follow-up I have is any contemplation of perhaps more aggressive dividends in your capital return program prior to the board decision for the $5 billion?\nJay Fishman :   Obviously dividends are a board decision. We typically review that with them annually. If you look at our history you\u2019ll see that to the extent we\u2019ve changed our dividend we\u2019ve done so in connection with the annual meeting which would take place at not this board meeting but the meeting after. We\u2019ll obviously evaluate the marketplace, our capital needs and everything else and make a recommendation to the board. But it\u2019s premature at this point to speculate on anything.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Brian Meredith - UBS. \nBrian Meredith - UBS : Can you talk about loss costs or terms and conditions in the commercial lines environment and what you\u2019re seeing there? You mentioned the frequency is flattening out. Does that have anything to do with maybe loosening terms and conditions or just the great favorable frequency trends coming to conclusions?\nBrian MacLean:\n : We\u2019ve talked about that a little bit last quarter. I\u2019d say we\u2019re seeing continuing of the same. We have not yet been in a spot where we felt we had to move our terms and conditions significantly. It\u2019s not really affecting our frequency numbers.  We are starting to see more of that in the softening in the market as everyone would anticipate. It somewhat goes with the comments Jay made if you talked about larger property accounts. That would be the most dramatic example. At the other extreme, nothing really significantly happening in the smaller account market.  Some movement, but it\u2019s not really driving the frequency in our book. I think it is just our frequency trends are more coming out of really an unprecedented period of, for many of our businesses, declining frequency numbers. They\u2019re really leveling out at something approximating zero trends. So not a bad place.\nBrian Meredith - UBS : Actually, is there anywhere in your commercial lines book of business or business lines that you\u2019re saying you\u2019re actively just pulling back from it or trying to reduce exposures because of market concerns?\nJay Fishman :\n : The only one where I think we have and have been for some time is in our excess standalone casualty liability business. We have a business unit that writes, in effect, umbrella liability, standalone. That business has been competitive and we\u2019ve been shrinking that business. It\u2019s not a terribly big business for us, but we\u2019ve been shrinking it, I\u2019d say aggressively for the past 12 months.\nBrian MacLean:   Even a little longer than that.\nJay Fishman :   But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything new in the news in the marketplace that\u2019s changing our profile. That\u2019s the only area where I can think of where we\u2019ve clearly made the decision a while ago now that this is not for us.\nBrian MacLean:   There\u2019s no other area where we\u2019re taking significant actions.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Jay Cohen - Merrill Lynch. \nJay Cohen - Merrill Lynch : There seems to be a foregone conclusion -- and this is probably the right one -- that the pricing environment will just continue to deteriorate until there is absolute stupidity like what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Can you envision an environment where the pricing essentially begins to stabilize over the next two years and returns stabilize at a still reasonable level? Is that a possibility at all?\nJay Fishman :   Jay, I\u2019ve been talking for a couple of years now actually at some risk to my perceived sanity, that there\u2019s lots of factors that could cause one to believe that the traditional cycle that we\u2019ve seen in the business may be somewhat different this time. We\u2019ve talked about terrorism. We\u2019ve talked about the management of various companies and how much that\u2019s changed. We\u2019ve talked about the tools and analytics that are available universally in the industry now and the fact that people are not running the business by the seat of their pants but in fact the analytics are really very much improved.  We\u2019ve talked a little bit about the Sarbanes Oxley process that all companies, I believe certainly as we do go through; I mean there are so many people internally here that certify the financial statements that any concern about loss trend or reserve development gets evidenced very, very early and filters up to senior levels of management. I think you can make thoughtful decisions about risk-taking.  I think it\u2019s interesting that virtually every company in the business of any size has been involved now in share buybacks or dividends. If you look back in the \u201890s, that was not the case. There were companies that had programs but there were precious few who were actually in the market returning capital.  The fact that we are this long into the cycle and our guidance would translate to a 13% to 14% return on equity range, even before the impact of any development I think is an indication of the fact that we are believers that it may not necessarily be as dramatically bad as it\u2019s been before. I think there are lots of signals; and again, I\u2019ve said this before. Look at the retentions. The retentions and ours are exceptionally strong but there are other companies that also have had strong retentions. That is a counter-indicative signal with respect to a highly competitive, as you say, stupidity environment.  We were looking at middle-market retentions in the \u201890s that were in the high 60s, and now we\u2019re talking in the mid \u201880s. These are very dramatic differences. Although I\u2019ve worked for people who said don\u2019t ever assume it will be different this time so I think we look to next year and assume that it will continue to be somewhat more competitive than it was this year but I still think there are lots of indications out there that it may indeed be a little bit different. So we\u2019re hopeful.\nJay Cohen - Merrill Lynch : On the share repurchase, you obviously have been very aggressive in buying back your own stock. If you base success of this buyback on your stock price -- in other words, creating shareholder value -- you could conclude that it\u2019s not doing a lot for you. Does that ever disturb you? Do you ever consider, hey, what if we don\u2019t buy back stock, what would happen?\nJay Fishman :   Well, sure, to answer that portion of the question.  But the share buyback has had a meaningful impact on our return on equity. We actually do measure the cumulative impact of the share buyback on our return on equity. I think it provides clarity and transparency to investors because there always seems to be the question that if we didn\u2019t buy it back what are we holding it for? So I\u2019m personally a believer that this is absolutely the right thing to do.  The only alternative that we have is to plunk it into the bond portfolio. When I last looked this morning, the 10-year Treasury was yielding 3.6%. I\u2019d rather that you all decide what to do with the money that comes back if you don\u2019t want to own our shares.  I continue to believe it\u2019s the right thing to do. It\u2019s sort of obvious to us, frankly. Again, I don\u2019t know what other alternatives there are. It\u2019s interesting that we get sometimes I\u2019d say modestly criticized for growing our business too aggressively. I don\u2019t understand that criticism. I think our numbers support our growth appetite significantly. Yet we\u2019re only absorbing modest amounts of capital in doing so what would you do with the rest? I think it\u2019s sort of obvious.  To give you some sense of it, the 2007 return on equity was 1.3 points benefited by the share buyback cumulatively over time. That\u2019s 130 basis points positive. Eventually one would think that investors will take note of that. They will perceive that the return on equity in our company is better than it otherwise would have been and I believe better than many of our competitors and will ultimately choose to say that\u2019s a security we\u2019d like to own.  The fundamental reason for doing this is to maximize shareholder value. So no, certainly it\u2019s disappointing when things like this work out, but it doesn\u2019t cause any concern about our strategy.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Josh Shanker - Citigroup. \nJosh Shanker - Citigroup : I was wondering if you could give us any granularity given that the 2007 year is complete on the net favorable development, could you talk about how gross development would work for certain vintages? Give us an idea about reserve releases from \u201806, \u201805 \u201804 and how \u201897 to \u201801 is looking and whatnot?\nJay Benet:   There really weren\u2019t any major trends that were underlying the favorable developments in this quarter. This was a lot of little changes that came about in actuarial reviews of each of the business lines.  As I\u2019ve said before, we do these very thorough reviews on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So this isn\u2019t like an annual review that was different from what we\u2019ve been doing in previous quarters.  I would say overall there\u2019s no great information or great trends taking place. What I would say is that we\u2019ve had more data come up on recent years. I think most of what you\u2019re seeing here is related to property business and some liability business in recent years.\nJosh Shanker - Citigroup : Have you seen a general freezing of development for those years that were quite painful in previous years?\nJay Benet:   We haven\u2019t seen much movement in that in the earlier years, if that\u2019s what your question is.\nJosh Shanker - Citigroup : So in the end could we perceive that the difference between the gross development and net favorable development is about the same for the quarter?\nJay Benet:   Gross and net in this case is in the eyes of the beholder. I mean we look at things on a segment basis, each individual product line. The level of granularity we use here is very significant. I don\u2019t want to give the impression that every single reserve that we had developed favorably. The amount of movement in any of the reserves tended to be quite small.  This is not the result of some large negatives being offset by large positives. \nOperator:  Your next question comes from David Small - Bear Stearns. \nDavid Small - Bear Stearns : You mentioned that you bought some ABS in the quarter that\u2019s backed by sub-prime. Could you just tell us when in the fourth quarter? Was it at the beginning of the fourth quarter, the end of the fourth quarter that you bought that?\nBill Highman: We bought them at various points; highly selectively less due to the climate of that particular day or week than due to what we have show as some of it [inaudible]. Typically to buy a $10 million piece requires two people to spend an afternoon, one doing the modeling and the other negotiating with the dealer. It\u2019s a highly labor intensive process, and each purchase is really [inaudible]. It\u2019s hard to characterize the purchases as a whole. We bought maybe $100 million consisting of 10 pieces.\nDavid Small - Bear Stearns : In the quarter did you revise your management liability current accident year loss ratio?\nJay Fishman :   No. That goes back to my earlier comment that at least at the moment that the experience that we\u2019re both seeing and anticipating in the management liability business falls within the normal loss expectation that one would have for the business when taken as a whole.\nDavid Small - Bear Stearns : Jay, earlier you were talking about a desire to be AA from all the rating agencies. Could you just help us understand what you think the benefits to the company are of having that rating?\nJay Fishman :   It\u2019s not a big deal -- let me be very clear about this. I wouldn\u2019t pursue a lot of cost in pursuing a AA versus a AA minus. I just think as a financial services company where ratings matter that to be a AA company and afford that to your customers has some long-term value associated with it.  I\u2019ve been out of the treasury business for a number of years but it used to be that AA flat also made you an A1P1 short-term issuer and the AA minus makes you an A2P2 issuer. Again, not that we\u2019re in the commercial paper business, but I do think that financial services companies should aspire to have the highest ratings. That\u2019s the only reason. Not that we would spend a lot or go through a lot of excess capital position to acquire it.\nJay Benet:   There are no conversations with ratings agencies that suggest to achieve those goals we have to increase our capital base over and above what it already is.\nJay Fishman :   There should be no confusion by anybody on this call about our aggressiveness with respect to returning capital to shareholders. It\u2019s not transactional, it\u2019s strategic. It is strategic. We do it consistently. It\u2019s part of our philosophy, and it is not limited or driven by any particular dynamic. It\u2019s just the right way we think to run a business.\nDavid Small - Bear Stearns : If you think about the commercial book, I think you talked earlier about the frequency trends being flat. I\u2019m trying to get the idea of what is the spread right now, do you think, between the loss trends and the price change? If you think about, well, frequency is flat. What\u2019s severity doing if pricing is down a few points? It seems likely you\u2019re going to get that margin compression. I\u2019m trying to figure out how wide that would be right now.\nJay Fishman :   Again, we were very upfront about that comment. We said that our guidance for 2008 envisions about a 1% increase in our combined ratio. That\u2019s being driven by the fact that we\u2019re planning for, I would call it modest loss trend and some decline in rate. That\u2019s what accounts for that 1% difference.\nJay Benet:   Then you\u2019ve got mix and you\u2019ve got bond initiatives.\nJay Fishman :   There\u2019s a lot of other things that go into it but our guidance for 2008 does envision a 1 point increase and I would characterize that as very reasonable under the circumstances reflecting the notion that pricing may continue to decline.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Charlie Gates - Credit Suisse. \nCharlie Gates - Credit Suisse : On both the Markel conference call and the RLI conference call, they opined that they saw standard markets companies entering the excess and surplus lines business. To what extent do you think that the Travelers might be one of those standard markets companies?\nJay Benet:   We seem to continue to get that question and we actually went back a couple of quarters and looked at our data on our middle market book of business and we are taking virtually no business and moving it from the E&S market into our standard commercial environment.\nJay Fishman :   Our answer very directly would be not at all, to your question. Not at all.\nCharlie Gates - Credit Suisse : I\u2019m on slide number 22. George Joseph, out at Mercury General opined several years ago that I think he thought your company was adopting, with regard to personal auto, a take allcomers strategy. He put other companies into that same box.  That said, reading from your slide, \u201cQuantum intentionally targeted a broader spectrum of drivers than captured by historic product reach.\u201d Is that what he\u2019s referring to?\nJoe Lacher:   I\u2019m not 100% what he\u2019s referring to. You\u2019d have to check with him. What I can tell you, Charlie, is we very clearly have talked before that back in the 2000/2001 timeframe, our product was very focused on a highly preferred segment of the marketplace. We very clearly talked about Quantum and its roll out, that we were not moving into the non-standard segment of the market which is generally described as running 20%, 25% of the marketplace but we were moving out of our niche in that highly preferred segment into more preferred and standard business.  So it is by no means a take allcomers strategy. We\u2019ve demonstrated any number of times with underlying data that that\u2019s not the book of business that we\u2019re writing, but it is in fact broader than the niche we were hunkered in in 2000.\nCharlie Gates - Credit Suisse : Could you give an example of the new standard market? Say the standard market before was a guy who lived in the suburbs who drives to work; what\u2019s the new standard market guy look like?\nJoe Lacher:   I think the standard market might be the same definition -- I\u2019m referring to that as highly preferred preferred standard and nonstandard. What we would have done before is we might have had a book that had less youthful drivers; drivers with fewer incidents than average. That would make them a more preferred set of risk.  As we move out to drivers who might have one or two speeding tickets or a minor accident on their record or might have more presence of youthful on the policy that might be something that might move into a more standard classification.\nJay Fishman : A way to think about Quantum is that it represents or will eventually represent the broader spectrum of the American driver as opposed to the old programs which were very targeted at the highly preferred segment.  You can think about that from an IFS score, if you like. You can think about it from an incidence. But it simply broadens out and provides a price for a broader group of customers than our product really did before. It certainly is not a take allcomers.\nOperator:  Your final question comes from Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners. \nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners : I was hoping you could spend just a little bit more time on the auto frequency results. Particularly it looks like many folks assume that the frequency trend would continue to be favorable. What\u2019s your view on that topic? Do you think at some point in time we start getting negative frequency trends and see some price increases as a result of inflation at your firm?\nJoe Lacher: Well, what we\u2019ve seen is that loss frequency if you look over the last ten years had a significant decline and we are near historic lows from an absolute frequency perspective. So it wouldn\u2019t surprise us if we saw those frequency numbers climb a little bit.  When you measure frequency trend, that\u2019s of course the change from period over period so ticking up a little bit to see some positive trend but still be near historic lows. We\u2019re seeing a little bit of increase in frequency in the last several quarters. It\u2019s not at alarming rates of growth. When we project forward total loss trend and project total loss trend to be in the low to mid single digits and that\u2019s what we think about through our environment over the next year, which is incorporated in our underlying guidance.  We don\u2019t usually break that apart when we\u2019re disclosing it between frequency and severity, because sometimes those move counter to each other. We feel it\u2019s really more appropriate to project them in aggregate.\nJay Fishman :   Independent of the mix change which we are trying to highlight on page 22, obviously page 21 shows a modest increase in frequency. It\u2019s very difficult to look out and predict with any thoughtfulness what\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re talking about everything from numbers of miles driven to the impact of fuel and seatbelt usage and cell phone usage and changing state laws that require hands-free.  There are so many variables that go into frequency. I don\u2019t think that we particularly have any great insight into why something would change. Again, that\u2019s independent of the mix dynamic on page 22.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners : Are you pricing for low single digit claims inflation currently?\nJoe Lacher:   The guidance that we provided anticipates that running through the environment.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners : That\u2019s not the question. The question is whether or not you\u2019re pricing for it in your policies.\nJay Fishman :   Let\u2019s back up for a moment. We provide and have at our investor days given insight into the returns that we are recording in our businesses and as it relates to the personal lines business broadly and particularly it\u2019s well within the targeted returns of the business.  If you\u2019re asking how we price a particular product in a particular market, it\u2019s a very complicated question. We look for the returns on a book of business overall and the book of business continues to meet our target thresholds. We\u2019re pricing it to do that. I\u2019m not sure exactly how to answer the question but we\u2019re pricing the product to achieve our targeted returns.\nJoe Lacher:   We look at targeted returns. We look at the marketplace dynamics. We look at opportunities for growth. We look at what we expect will be the underlying loss trend and we put them all together. We don\u2019t take any one of those variables independently and solely make a price change on that. We\u2019re not trying to dodge the question. You\u2019ve got to take all four, five of those things and mix them together.\nJay Fishman :   Again, broadly stated, we price the product achieve our targeted returns given everything we see happening in the marketplace. So a silly assumption would be that we price it to achieve targeted returns assuming a decrease in loss trend. We are not assuming a decrease in loss trend. We are essentially assuming that loss trend will continue at low single-digits. That\u2019s how we price our product.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners : I think we\u2019re all just trying to figure out if auto has bottomed out industrywide. There\u2019s certain mixed results from various companies.\nJay Fishman :   I don\u2019t have a comment I can make on industrywide dynamics. Page 21 is giving you very specific insight into our book and you can see that our loss trend has been running for the last several quarters in the low single-digit and total loss trend and that\u2019s how we\u2019re pricing our product.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners : Thank you for the increased disclosure. That detail is very helpful.\nOperator:  Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Connelly for closing remarks.\nMichael Connelly: Thanks very much for taking the time with us today to discuss what was a terrific 2007.

Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Lacey. Good morning to everyone and welcome to the Travelers discussion of the fourth quarter and year-end 2008 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section. With me today is Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alan Schnitzer, head of our Financial, Professional & International Insurance business; Joe Lacher, head of our Personal & Select businesses; as well as other members of senior management. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will open it for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the following on page 1 of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts may be forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking, and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserves, and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website, travelers.com. With that, I will turn it over to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We have a lot to cover, but I think it is important to put today\u2019s reported results as well as some of the other topics that we will be discussing today into the broader context of our organization. This year\u2019s performance is reflective of Travelers long-standing approach to managing risks in order to achieve our targeted results over time. I have said many times before that our fundamental business is one of managing the balance between risk and reward, both on the liability side as well as on the asset side of our balance sheet. What you see in our results today is an operating return on equity of 12.4%, and importantly, a four-year average annual operating return on equity of approximately 14.5% comes from this core cultural value and from as decisions we have made and actions we have taken or not taken over the past several years, not just this year. Looking back to what we said this time last year, we assessed the insurance marketplace more or less correctly. We expected it to be more challenging from a margin perspective, and it was. With that said, we are very pleased that our initiatives over the last few years have paid off, for example, an increased flow. We\u2019re also pleased that our metrics suggest that we continue to maintain our underwriting discipline. On the investment side, market conditions were clearly much more challenging than anyone anticipated. However, all things considered, I could not be more pleased with our performance and the position of our investment portfolio. We have received a number of questions in the last few months on how we are able to avoid so many of the investment issues which plagued the market this year. The answer is not that we saw everything coming. But in many areas, we believe that risk was underpriced. In that regard, we were fortunate. As I have also said if certain asset classes had been better priced, we would likely have been somewhat invested in at least a few of them. As it relates to pricing, I have noted in the last six months that the world feels like a riskier place. Recent data suggests that we may now be starting to see an improvement in the pricing environment. We are by no means ready to declare a bottom, but we like the data and we will discuss it in more detail with you this morning. On the investment side, we are still seeing a big spread between the bid and ask, but conditions in some investment areas in 2009 may provide more opportunities. Our results over the last few years have demonstrated a consistent and successful approach to assuming and managing risks in order to achieve an appropriate return for our shareholders. Nothing in that approach or in our culture has changed. I believe we continue to be well positioned to meet both the challenges and opportunities posed by the current environment, and deliver on our long-term strategy. While I will not go through the specifics of the quarter, I just want to highlight our strong results, superior returns and importantly increased book value in 2008. With that let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jack. Turning to page 4 of the webcast, let me start by saying that our investment portfolio, reserves, capital and liquidity continue to be in fine shape, despite the continuing turmoil in the financial markets. Our operating company capital remained at or above all of our target levels, our debt-to-total capital ratio of 19.5% was below our 20% target, the midpoint of the 15 to 25% range that arrives from our AA ratings target. Holding company liquidity was $2.1 billion remaining at almost twice our target of one years\u2019 worth of interest and dividend. This is after contributing $450 million to our qualified pension plan, which was funded at a 92% funding level at year-end. We have negligible amounts of debt maturing in the next three years and do not rely on commercial paper. Book value per share ex FAS-115 of $43.37, increased 5% for the year after purchasing over $2.1 billion of common shares and paying $712 million of common stock dividend and once again we closed the year with over $25 billion of common equity. On page 5, we updated recent areas of market disruption and their impact or lack thereof on Travelers. Overall, we continue to be unaffected in any significant way. Note that we have no direct investments related to the Madoff matter and are not aware of indirect investment exposures we may have based on inquiries we made of our fund managers. Page 6 shows a cap and net favorable prior reserve development continue to play a meaningful role in our quarterly results. Prior year reserve development favorably impacted our fourth quarter GAAP combined ratio by 5.1 point and a downward adjustment of estimated costs associated with current year caps, mostly related to hurricane Ike, which included the Texas Windpool assessment and hurricane Gustav, favorably impacted this quarter\u2019s combined ratio by 1.6 points. I would also like to point out that we recorded an $89 million tax benefit related to the sale of Unionamerica our UK runoff business subsidiary. The sale of Unionamerica also produced a small realized gain in addition to this tax benefit. It eliminated $790 million of net reserves, which included $265 million of A&E and it freed up supporting capital.  Ex caps and net favorable prior year reserve development, our GAAP combined ratio was 92.5% and we remain very pleased with the underlying profitability of our businesses.  Page 7 of the web cast shows the three major contributors to our operating return on equity. Fixing income NII plus interest on corporate debt remained the major driver. This passage of time component contributed 8.7 points in the current year, down slightly from the prior years, entirely due to lower short-term interest rates. A much smaller contributor operating ROE, but one that does vary from period to period is non-fixed income NII, which contributed a negative 0.6 percentage points this quarter, due to the difficult investment marketing conditions we faced as compared to a positive 1.4 to 1.6 points in prior years. And underwriting contributed 4.3 point for the year below the last two years due to the high level of weather-related losses. Cumulatively from January 2005, we produced an average annual operating ROE of approximately 14.5%, consistent with our stated longer term goal of mid-teens ROE. The fourth quarter net investment income of $438 million after tax as shown on page 8 was down significantly from recent quarters. The after-tax yield on our fixed income portfolio was 3.7%, consistent with prior years. That is the long-term fixed income portfolio, while the short-term portfolio yielded 1.1%, due to the actions taken by the Feds to lower short-term interest rates. The non-fixed income portfolio yielded a negative 14.9%, giving back a third of its 2007 NII, as private equity real estate partnership and hedge fund evaluations were impacted by the challenging financial markets. Consistent with our practice, we were diligent in updating our non-fixed income returns through December 31, despite the usual time lag in which investment managers report results. Accordingly, our fourth quarter non-fixed income portfolio loss of $164 million after-tax included $56 million of after-tax losses that were reported, based upon information requested by us and recently made available to us by certain of our investment managers. As you will see, in our guidance, we are hoping for considerable improvement in our non-fixed income returns in 2009, but fully realize that they will be subject to evolving market conditions. The composition of our $71 billion investment portfolio remains unchanged from recent periods. At year-end fixed income comprised 94% and non-fixed income 6% of the portfolio. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains at AA+. Its duration was 4.2 and the below investment grade portion was only 2%. And given movements in treasury rates, credit spreads, and equity markets doing the quarter, our after-tax net unrealized investment losses were reduced to $144 million at year-end, an improvement from $818 million at the end of the third quarter. Our investment portfolio remains well diversified across industries, investment types and individual issuers. We continue to apply very rigorous processes to identify investments for which write-down should be made. So during the fourth quarter, we recorded net realized investment losses of a $138 million after-tax, including impairment of a $129 million after-tax, bringing full year net realized investment losses to $271 million after-tax, which represents a very small percentage of both our investment portfolio and our capital. The information that appears on page 9 is based on a schedule that will appear in our Form 10-K, showing unrealized losses on investments, which estimated market value is less than 80% of amortized cost. This amount has increased from the third quarter. It now stands at $744 million, with the vast majority in this position for 30 days or less. While this still represents a small fraction of both total investments and shareholders\u2019 equity, we do closely monitor these investments. And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. To give some context to the business results, I would like to start by offering some broad comments and then address the business insurance results, specifically. Obviously, the economy is in a turbulent state. It has impacted our industry broadly and for many individual companies in a profoundly negative way. Yet, as our results will show, we\u2019re favorably positioned for and have effectively managed this environment, delivering positive results for our customers and for our shareholders. As an industry, we\u2019re sensitive to macroeconomic forces, such as decreased demand for goods and services and higher unemployment. These and other pressures drive down payrolls, receipts, and consumer and business spending, thereby limiting the overall growth and insurable assets and impacting insurers\u2019 ability to grow the top line. In addition, the current economic environment has also resulted in significant dislocation in the financial services industry, driving customers, agents and brokers to more strongly than ever consider the financial and operational stability of their business relationships, including with their insurance carriers. This flight to quality has complemented the fundamentals we have developed during recent years, including our broad risk appetite, underwriting specialization, ease of doing business and claim effectiveness. The resulting stability we have experienced has allowed us to focus on the consistency of our strategy, and to deliver superior products and services, as well as solid financial performance in these turbulent times. Given that context, let\u2019s review the details beginning with the business insurance results on slide 10. Business insurance delivered operating income of $619 million, compared to $729 million in the same quarter last year. The combined ratio, as adjusted on the page, was 93.2 for the quarter, a deterioration of 1.8 points from the fourth quarter last year, and still at a healthy level. The deterioration is primarily due to the earned impact of the modest rate decreases and loss inflation we have experienced throughout the year, as well as some large loss activity, which in the fourth quarter was again above normal levels. Net written premium, as shown on slide 11, declined slightly or 1% overall from the fourth quarter of 2007. The overall economic contraction is affecting the top line of all of our businesses, but most dramatically construction, builders risk policies and inland marine, large property accounts and the trucking business. So given the impact of the environment, we\u2019re very pleased that in the aggregate we have basically flat top line. As we look at the production details on slide 12, we can see how we have been able to maintain level premiums in a contracting economy. First, retention remains high across all our domestic commercial businesses, and has increased to 88% in Commercial Accounts, our core middle market unit. We have been speaking all year about the importance of high retention, and these results are a direct outcome of our conscious strategy to maintain stability across a variety of marketplace conditions and are a critical factor to our success in today\u2019s environment. They also speak to the flight to quality dynamic and the value of our product, services and brand in the marketplace. Looking at renewal price change data for the BI segment, you can see that the change is generally consistent with recent quarters. But this data is not total price change and we thought this data is total price change and we thought it was important this quarter to look at the components of the change, to see what is really going on with pricing. So on slide 13, we graphed the two components of price change. That is rate and exposure. And here we see two distinct trends that essentially net out in the RPC. That is for us, rates have been generally improving over the last four months, while exposures have been generally declining. So although premium is relatively flat, all other things being equal, our margin picture is improving. The magnitude is different by customer group or line. In businesses like National Property, the shifts have been significant with rate change improving dramatically in recent months, while in Commercial Accounts rate improvements and exposure declines have been more moderate but steady. Even in small commercial, which is not shown on the slide, we\u2019ve seen a shift with marginal month-over-month improvement in rate change and offsetting deterioration in exposure growth in each of the last four months. Obviously, three or four months of activity is not enough to declare a change in the market, and we always remind you that we don\u2019t have a crystal ball on where things are going, but the run rate for these measures has clearly shifted since September. Turning to slide 14, the amount of new business written, in aggregate, is down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2007. In select, our small commercial business, new business in the second half of the year increased as the result of the product and platform expansion we have spoken to you about in the past. Across our other domestic commercial businesses, new business dollars are down or flat, reflecting the current economic environment and competitive new business pricing dynamics. In analyzing new business, it is important to speak to the new business opportunities or flow of new business that we see. Flow statistics were up in nearly all of our businesses this quarter. This increase follows the trend we\u2019ve been seeing throughout the last two years and is the result of both our strategy to drive more opportunities across all our businesses, and the flight to quality we\u2019re seeing in the market place. Some of the quarter\u2019s increase in flow is attributable to other carriers\u2019 instability but most is a result of our new product offerings, platform enhancements and strong positioning with agents and customers. Even though we\u2019re seeing strong new business deal flows, the new business pricing environment we have to compete in, remains very competitive. We have been rigorous in adhering to our underwriting standards and therefore our hit ratio or the percentage of quotes that we are writing has declined. As we have previously emphasized on both new and renewal business, we are maintaining our disciplined underwriting standards. So in the aggregate we\u2019re very comfortable with the quality of business we\u2019re writing. So, overall in the business insurance segment, basically level top line, and solid margins. And in these market conditions this is a result we are very pleased with. With that, let me turn it over to Alan Schnitzer for the financial, professional and international insurance results.\nAlan Schnitzer: Turning to slide 15, in the financial, professional and international insurance segment, operating income was a $154 million for the quarter, as compared to $184 million in the prior year. The adjusted combined ratio for the quarter was 92.4%, up 2.7 points from the fourth quarter of last year. The primary driver was a small number of large losses in the international business, although, our large loss experience has improved from prior quarters. Net written premiums in the quarter declined 3% from the fourth quarter of 2007. In bond and financial products, the decrease in net written premium is primarily due to lower volumes in the surety business. In international decrease resulted from foreign currency translation. Turning to slide 16, in our management liability business in the quarter, retention remained high and consistent throughout the year. Renewal price change was slightly positive at 1% all attributable to rates and new business was strong. The new business gains were driven by an increased flow of new opportunities from a flight-to-quality in the public company liability business, partially offset by decline in new business in our financial institutions book, due to disciplined underwriting. In the international business, retention was at 76% in the quarter, down both year-over-year and over recent quarters, primarily due to intensive underwriting actions. The rate in the quarter was flat after 8 quarters of negative rate change and other RPC was a positive 6%. This time last year, we provided you with information about what we termed as sub-prime exposure. Over the course of the year, we have broadened the scope of our attention beyond sub-prime to include management liability exposure, arising out of the disruption in the financial markets more generally. Starting on slide 17, I would like to provide you with an update. We have consistently focused on building a well-diversified portfolio, management liability products, sold through various business units. We believe that this diversification and more specifically, the lack of over concentration in any one area, such as large publicly traded financial institutions, provides substantial mitigation against shock coming from events, such as the financial market disruption we have all seen over the past year. As you can see, we write approximately $1.6 billion of management liability premiums. In the current economic environment, many of these liability products are certainly subject to some level of increased exposure. We have broken down our management liability exposure into four product groups: DNO, ENO, fiduciary liability and other. And we have identified the amount of premium within each product group that we estimate is subject to a significant elevation of exposure, emanating from the financial market disruption. We estimate that the written premium from accounts at elevated risk as a percentage of our overall management liability portfolio is a modest 17% as a percentage of Traveler\u2019s overall gross written premium it is only about 1%. Turning to slide 18; it is important to consider the specific characters of these products and our disciplined approach to underwriting. DNO, ENO and fiduciary coverages are written on claims-made forms that contain defense costs within policy limits. Policies with elevated risk levels contain limits that are generally low, between $1 million and $25 million. But more importantly, average approximately $4 million. These policies are about evenly split between primary and excess coverages. Average attachment points for excess are relatively high at $46 million for DNO loan and $37 million when including fiduciary ENO. The larger account excess coverages comprise approximately 70% of the total. Please also note that we continue to use reinsurance to further mitigate portfolio risk. Our current analysis of 2008 claims, indicates little chance that we will approach the $375 million recovery cap. For 2009, we have revised our treaty to respond to frequency more than severity. On slide 19, I would like to walk threw the actions we have taken over time to address our potential exposure to financial market disruption. Since the first quarter of 2007, we have been proactively incorporating the financial market environment into our underwriting discipline. As we told you last year we conducted an individual account analysis on all accounts which reported claims, and for those individual accounts that we felt had a high level of exposure. The scope began with the accounts that included credit-related announcements or individual accounts with elevated risk characteristics, such as financial institutions, subprime lenders, bond insurers and home-builders and suppliers. Throughout 2008 on a monthly basis, we continue to update the analysis and expanded the scope to add more focus on community banks and consider exposures related to the Madoff matter. So, we continue to monitor the situation closely and revise our underwriting accordingly. Considering our diverse book and the way we have approached the market and managed our exposure, we expect that any potential issue would likely be a more manageable issue of frequency not severity. On slide 20, let me tell you how all this translates into our results. In case of claim notices arising out of financial market disruption reported in 2008 was consistent with 2007. With average limits and excess attachment points slightly more favorable in 2008, as compared to 2007. Our estimate of financial market disruption losses for 2007 improved from last year to this year, and excluding our exposure to the Madoff matter, our estimated losses for 2008 is consistent with our current estimate of losses for 2007. Although, it is early days of the firms and individuals identified publicly as having exposure to the Madoff matter, we have identified accounts in our management liability business with total exposed limits of approximately $150 million, net of reinsurance. We currently estimate that our actual aggregate losses from the Madoff matter, including accounts not yet identified, will be less than $75 million pre-tax, or $50 million after-tax. Some of which we recorded in 2008, and some of which we will record in 2009. We\u2019ve recognized estimates for financial market disruption and Madoff losses in our 2009 guidance. After considering all the items I mentioned, we expect our management liability business will remain profitable, as it was in 2008 and 2007. With that, let me turn it over to Joe for a discussion of personal line.\nJoe Lacher: Thanks Alan. Personal Insurance had a good quarter, strong earnings, growth and policies in force. Business continues to demonstrate the sound fundamentals. Looking at page 21, you can see that operating income is up $25 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, driven primarily by favorable cat results and offset by unfavorable net investment income. The fourth quarter had a favorable GAAP combined ratio of 85.6%, versus fourth quarter 2007 of 90.8%. Our expense ratio decreased one point in the fourth quarter 2007, primarily driven by a favorable adjustment to our estimate for the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association losses from Hurricane Ike. Adjusting for cats, prior year development, and current year re-estimation our adjusted combined ratio is slightly better than last year. Overall, a written premium increased 4%, despite challenging market conditions. As you can see from our production results on page 22, we continue to see solid business statistics in both auto and property. Looking specifically at property, production results for the quarter were strong, with policies in force increasing 3%, retention stable at 86% and a consistent renewal price change of plus 6%. Homeowners new business is somewhat related to home sales. Against the backdrop of significantly declining home sales, we remain very pleased with continuing growth of the Quantum Home product and its ability to increase new business volumes. Quantum Home policies now represent more than 13% of our policies in force. Shifting to auto, you can see that our production results remained solid. We continue to see increasing pressure on new business in the marketplace, but our renewal price change increased 4%, retention remained in line with prior quarters. Policies, in force, grew 2% over the fourth quarter 2007, with new business premiums up slightly. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 100.1% or 5.3 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2007. This is driven by a difference in prior period development, and after normalizing for this prior period development, the combined ratio was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007. Page 23 provides a view of our auto loss trends. As you can see, total auto loss trends continue to be relatively flat in the quarter. Severity trend was slightly increasing and was offset by decreased frequency. While the marketplace remains competitive, we\u2019re seeing some increasing signs of firming, particularly in the auto line. We\u2019re continuing to monitor loss trends, profitability, marketplace conditions as well as the changing economic climate and will appropriately adjust our tactics going forward. We remain pleased with the growth of our business, its underlying performance and look forward to building on that success. With that, I will turn it back over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Joe. Pages 24 and 25 set forth our guidance for 2009 along with certain supporting information. We\u2019re projecting fully diluted operating income per share in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, which should translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 10% to 11%. Our guidance assumes cat losses of $360 million after-tax or $0.62 per diluted share. No prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable. A 2.4% non-fixed income portfolio yield. $1 billion of share repurchases, which would be a reduction from recent years, reflecting potential investment returns, and more properly reflect risk along with the uncertain economic conditions that all businesses face rather than a shift in our capital management strategy. No significant change in average invested assets, ex FAS 115 and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 585 million shares after share repurchases and employee equity awards. With that, we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our first question will come from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Thanks, good morning. I had a question on the guidance. Jay, could you give us a bit more insight in terms of your comfort level with the 2.4% return on the non-fixed income portfolio, and Travelers is in my view probably be one of a very few property casualty insurers that will be buying back stock in 2009. Can you talk about your comfort level there as well?\nJay Fishman:  First with respect to the investment yield, the reason that we provided it, obviously, is because of the uncertain environment that we are in. And one can be more optimistic or more pessimistic, and this really ties to our budget for the year and it is premised on a real estate portfolio for which we continue to collect rents, that will provide a positive return that\u2019s offset by what I would characterize as a fairly nominal return in the rest of the alternative investment portfolio. So it is a blend. But it does not assume obviously in the aggregate of continuation of what we saw in the fourth quarter. But one can obviously have a different view, which is why we decided to provide the number more specifically this year.\nJay Benet: You want me to cover the share repurchase?\nJay Fishman: Sure.\nJay Benet: As far as the share repurchases, as we said before, we manage our capital beginning with the operating companies and our operating companies are very well capitalized. So, we look at things that we will impact that and we have got earnings projections, we have got moving dividends out of the operating companies up to the holding companies. We have got what we think is generation of excess capital in the place and we are going to prudently manage it. We are saying that the million dollars of buybacks, which is --it\u2019s not \u2013it shouldn\u2019t be viewed as plan. We are going to execute based on what market conditions look like and we are going to execute based on what opportunities look like to invest in our investment portfolio, as I said earlier. But for the purposes of guidance and the overall feel of the place, we will be generating excess capital to the extent we don\u2019t have the investment opportunities and everything else, including liquidity and having the appropriate capital cushion to cover it, we will return it to share holders through buyback.\nJay Fishman: And Jay, just to add a bit to that comment, if possible that investment yields become more appropriately reflective of risk in 2009, and there is a consequence, the alternatives for buying back shares may become more robust than they have been in previous years but I\u2019m certainly not making a prediction. In previous years the alternative was a relatively modest bond yield of 4.5%, even at its highest levels. And it is possible given the markets and given the credit markets specifically, that returns in other highly rated -- I am not speaking now about moving either down in credit quality or long in terms of return. I am really just speaking about more appropriate returns for appropriate risk assets for a property casualty company. They may be more robust. So one of our alternatives this year as we go through the year is to evaluate what is the best for providing shareholder return over time? If there are investment opportunities in the context of other fixed income instruments that are more reflective of long-term returns, we will do that. If not, we\u2019ve always said we would right-size capital and will return. I do think Jay\u2019s comment about being more reflective generally of a challenging economic environment is a real one. The last thing we would ever want to do, is to be buying back shares in one period, and then finding ourselves in a position of having to issue equity indexed. That is just a head scratcher for us. And so we are going to manage that just judiciously as markets involve.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Thanks. If I could just ask one more quick one. And could you update us on your outlook for the surety environment in a tough economic environment?\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure Tom Kunkel is with us today. He is the CEO of our bond and financial products business. Why don\u2019t we let Tom take that question?\nTom Kunkel: Sure, thank you, Alan. The outlook for the surety business clearly there has been some level of drop off in public construction spending. We are looking though to see what kind of impact any public works program may have on -- what we\u2019re going to see for surety revenue going forward. As far as the condition of the contractors in our portfolio, clearly, I think, the larger contractors still have some pretty robust backlogs. The middle market people have seen some backlog shrink and they have seen some increased competition on bids. All that said, but the truth is, is that they\u2019re still showing the highest internal credit scores or near the top, that we have actually had. And in addition to that, I would say that, our underwriting continues to be very robust, we are doing comprehensive financial analysis. We\u2019re investigating credit relationships. We are closely monitoring new projects that are acquired and the margins that attained at and closely monitoring the progress of projects proceed towards completion. All those things said and done, we know management very closely in these companies to the point where we\u2019re out walking job sites with them. So, I don\u2019t think any one could say that we feel that we\u2019re immune to what is happening in the economy. But we do feel like our people are still very well positioned, going into it and being in the middle of this economy.\nJay Fishman: In the context of a loss perspective in that regard, though, is a credit sensitive business, and it will likely show higher losses in a more challenged credit environment than it would have in a less credit-challenged environment. Tom, I think, is providing the perspective of an underwriting oversight and the way the business is managed, but recognizing that it is certainly a more challenging economic environment.\nTom Kunkel: Absolutely, Jay, it certainly is more challenging than it was 24 months ago.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney. Please proceed.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Thanks and good morning. Just curious about your thought process and putting up about half of the policy limits from Madoff and what would have to change for that number to change materially in either direction?\nAlan Schnitzer: We have gone through all of our accounts that we think have exposure to Madoff and we have identified the ones that we think are likely to make claims but haven\u2019t yet. So, I think for this really to change dramatically, we have to see accounts coming from a high frequency of accounts that we haven\u2019t yet identified as having exposure. In terms of the amount we have put up, obviously we have analyzed the claims. We have looked at the policies, and we have recorded the amounts that we think are likely to be paid.\nJay Fishman: I think the point there Larry is that it is not a 50% across the board assessment of limits. It\u2019s actually a policy-by-policy review based upon the claim and on the claim data and information that we have so far. There are going to be policies that will be exposed. There are going to be policies where there will be significant defenses. There are going to be policies that may not even be exposed. And so the number that\u2019s here is not a pro-rata assessment of exposure, but much more an account-by-account analysis.\nAlan Schnitzer: That\u2019s right. And I think for there really to be a significant change from our expectation, we have to see claims from a large number of accounts that we\u2019re just not expecting claims from.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Great, fair enough. Follow-up, Jay, assuming that some of the positive pricing signs get some legs and the market were to continue to firm. There is always an elasticity of demand in the industry, and as buyers see their prices rise they tend to reduce their buying habits. Do you think, given the economy today that under that scenario, there would be a materially greater, let\u2019s say elasticity for a demand?\nJay Fishman: Exposure is certainly going to continue to be negative, I suspect. As we think by the way exposure for us means risk units for existing customers. And so if payrolls decline, workers comp premiums decline, that\u2019s a reduction in exposure.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Right.\nJay Fishman: If previously there were five trucks in the fleet and now they sell three, there is obviously less exposure. New business is impacted by new accounts. You are going to have a few things here. We\u2019re going to have obviously less business growth and arguably business shrinking, in that regard exposure will be either less than it would have been or perhaps even negative. And on the new business front, you\u2019re really talking about churn, moving of accounts from one carrier to another. That to me is a sort of a more predictable dynamic in that. That is going to likely continue. There is a flight to quality I think going on, and it would be not prudent to not anticipate declining exposure. I do think that as companies, particularly on the commercial side, and perhaps even on the consumer side tighten their belts you will see rising deductables, that circumstances that we have seen before. I don\u2019t know that we have seen, I have to go back and look. I don\u2019t know that we have seen declining limits. I think generally what we have seen is that people bought business in particular, is willing to self insure more at the bottom than they are to buy less at the top. But so, you\u2019re trading, working layer-oriented exposure, in that case, and its impact on profitability less than if it was at the top of the profile so to speak. But I would certainly anticipate declining exposure and rate will see. The last three or four months have been encouraging and we will have to wait to see what happens.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: But I guess just in terms of relative to historical cycle hardening, would you expect these trends to be much more pronounced given the economic climate today?\nJay Fishman: I am not answering, candidly I don\u2019t know. I am not sure that we have seen a circumstance before of the combination of as you describe it your words now, not mine, a hardening market, and a declining economic environment. The last couple of times that we have faced changes in cycles, they have been in some relatively robust economic times. And so we are at least from my experience going back into the \u201890\u2019s, I think this is somewhat unchartered and I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have an experience to look back to and point to. I have said before that I think that that there are plenty of good reasons to believe that the cycle behavior has changed. We said that several years ago. I think the statistics continue to bear that out. If, in fact, rates beginning to change, you wouldn\u2019t have bet that that would have happened with retentions being at all time highs. Historically, retention has been much lower, I remember in the middle market again in the high \u201860s, before the market really began to turn. We have a middle market retention of \u201886. So, I think that this cycle has been and continues to be different, behaviorally different than cycles that we have experienced before and I just don\u2019t know how to answer your question because I don\u2019t have a basis to have a conclusion on it. I do believe that exposure will continue to go down. That\u2019s about as much as I see in a crystal ball.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: That\u2019s fair. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning. It looked like there was an unrealized gain in the quarter after-tax of about $674 million. However, if you look at the AOCI line in your balance sheet presentation, it didn\u2019t change that much. It looks like there is some offset. I am assuming it\u2019s currency but could you discuss that?\nJay Benet: Yes Jay, this is Jay Benet. It is not currency. Without getting into the details of pension accounting, which as you know is very complex. The AOC is also going to be impacted by changes that take place in the pension plan, which are for actuarial purposes, not fully reflected on an immediate basis. So, even though we funded the pension plan to get it up to the 93% funding level, think of that as a change in cash to investment the way the pension accounting works. And then the unrealized loss that the pension assets experienced in particular this quarter, but for the year, gets reflected as a downward adjustment in the AOC to be recognized over time, as an actuarial loss in this particular case through the pension expense. That\u2019s what causing it.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, it is probably too early to even have a comment on this, but some of the claims that you have seen related to the broader credit crisis, is there anything to read into yet, some of the decisions that have, probably very few decisions that have come out on the trials or settlements related to these claims?\nJay Benet: I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s little early for that.\nJay Fishman: I think it is too early to draw conclusions from that.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Yeah, that is what I suspected. All right, thanks a lot.\nJay Fishman: The only comment perhaps and this is anecdotal and not just kind of reacting to your question, I think that there tends to be an emotional reaction to these things that eventually works its way through. I am thinking back to the perception that option backdating was somehow going to be a very significant event in the D&O professional liability area. And so far, it hasn\u2019t. And I think you can look back over the last few years of several events where the reaction, the analytical reaction tends to be my goodness there is significant exposure here and yet when the cases come and the litigation begins, circumstances often turn out differently. I think we\u2019re here way too early to come to any predictions. But I just think back to how many conversations we have had over the last few years of issues that people perceive to be confronting the professional liability business.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nVinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Hi, good morning. With respect to your financial institutions, D&O, I believe you have around $274 million worth of gross written premiums in 2008. I was wondering whether you could give us the gross exposure that you have out there, and what level of reserves have you put on that?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think the $274 million you\u2019re looking at is not just financial institutions. That is the total of the gross written premium that we have identified as having elevated exposure to financial market disruption more broadly. So, I just want to clarify that point. In terms of the gross limit you\u2019re looking for, that is not a number we have disclosed in the past and not something that\u2019s really I think is meaningful in terms of perhaps trying to draw the conclusion that you may be looking for.\nVinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Okay, and in terms of market share, what do you think market share for financial institutions would be?\nAlan Schnitzer: Let me ask Tom Kunkel to answer that question, but I think the thing you\u2019ve got to think about though is, you had a subsegment of the financial institution market that has, our market share among the large financial institutions isn\u2019t all that significant relative to our overall financial institution portfolio. Tom, do you have anything to add to that?\nTom Kunkel: Alan, I think you hit the key point so before estimating a figure, you would say we\u2019re again just various aspects and highly diversified across the whole financial marketplace. So to say a market share really does lump everything together. All that said and done, you could say that possibly there is an 8% or 9% market share. But a lot of it is in community banks, smaller institutions privately held, you see some mutual fund business. So, it is really diversified across all aspects of that business and more so, that is a part of a more highly diversified management liability business across the place.\nJay Fishman: And I think important, it often gets I think confused but a meaningful position for us is in community banks and I\u2019m going to go back in my recollection is it is 85% privately owned, right? Only 15% of which are public institutions. We\u2019re talking about, my recollection was again, total assets of is a $5 billion or less predominantly in the books. And we were going back to an old webcast where we gave the information on this community bank business, but it\u2019s been our experience at least so far that these are institutions that are generally not exposed to the kinds of issues that many of these questions are directed to 87%, I have got the statistics here 87% have assets less than $1 billion and 11% from $1 billion to $3 billion. And again, 85% of them are privately held. The average limit of D&O coverage for that bank is $3.8 million. So, one of the comments that we have made is that we\u2019re not a severity book. We\u2019re not writing significant numbers of 50 or 75 or $100 million of limits where one account can become problematic to our results. Our exposure and we have said this before in the financial arena, it would change if in fact somehow the community banks broadly were dragged into the financial crisis. We don\u2019t see that happen. So, it is always possible it may but we haven\u2019t seen that happen yet. We have some difficulty perceiving the circumstances that that could happen. These are typically not institutions that underwrite securities. These are typically local deposit-taking, loan-making banks that operate, again very locally. So I think if you look just to the market share, can produce an inappropriate analysis of what our exposure to these events might be.\nVinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Sure, that\u2019s fair. Just one follow-up, claim notices appear to be same in \u201808 versus \u201807. Just curious given your exposure to mostly smaller accounts, would it be fair for a person to think that in the first instance, the larger financial institutions would usually be sued, but then later on, you would have more of the smaller financial institutions being targeted.\nJay Fishman: I think the answer to that would be typically not. The first half correct, where suits tend to go is where assets exist and where there are deep pockets, and where the ability to martial class-action suits can produce a significant outcome. And so, I think you will see, obviously, an attraction of this kind of litigation to larger financial institutions. Many people will often ask who insures them. The answer, by the way, sometimes is in fact no one, or in fact no one in working layers. These are institutions that often self insure. Significantly amounts of DNO exposure and they buy relatively high up and this is not a universal statement But it is true that larger financial institution, the great big money center banks or at least the ones that used to be great big money center banks often self insure working layers of exposure. And it\u2019s not been our experience. Obviously, it can be different any given time, but it has not been our experience that litigation starts at higher institutions, and indeed, inevitably filters downs to smaller ones. That\u2019s not been a trend we have seen before, may be different this time but again it is difficult to attach the community bank business, not impossible, but difficult, to attach it to these circumstances. Now that\u2019s different from investment advisors, it is different from those institutions that Alan and Tom have spoken about. Let\u2019s say specifically in reference to the Madoff matter where we have a name and a policy and we have identified it and put it on the schedule. So, there it\u2019s different, but in the broader sense of the financial dislocation, we continue to feel pretty good that our exposure is diversified and tends to be of a lower smaller institutions.\nVinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: That\u2019s clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Yes, thanks I have a couple of questions here. First, Jay, the fact that you guys are looking to potentially buy back a $1 billion of stock. Does that at all indicate your appetite or view of some of the properties that are available out there in the marketplace? Just given the liquidity and excess capital that you have, I figured you would be in a pretty good position to maybe pick up some attractive assets.\nJay Fishman: No, it doesn\u2019t. It is a number to be used for the purpose of establishing guidance. We look at lots of things. Will Heyman looks at investment opportunities that come along in our asset portfolio. And to the extent that business opportunities come along, it would imprudent of us not to look and evaluate and consider. So no, it really is a number, a starting point, if you like, for the purposes of calculating guidance.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Great, and then to the next question. If I look at your guidance for this year, it comes out to be 10% to 11% return on equity. Would you view that is kind of a trough ROE going through the market for Travelers?\nJay Fishman: Well, I would hope so. I mean that would be a pretty good outcome. If you look at the bottom, again you\u2019re getting into sort of questions about cyclicality in debts and all the rest, the last time the cycle turned I think most people in the industry would have given anything to produce a 10% or 11% return at the bottom. So I don\u2019t know. I mean again it\u2019s a crystal ball question. All I can do is tell you that the rate data for the last several months has been encouraging and it would certainly be a nice place to begin to make a bottom, again with retentions at all time highs and with projected returns in that 10% to 11%, it would feel good to be making a bottom there if it happens.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Great. And then the last question quickly for Brian. You mentioned the hit ratios continue to decline here, although your flow is moving up. I am just curious, can you get into a little bit on why you think that is happening. Is it some of the struggling carriers out there, perhaps or getting even more aggressive in trying to retain business? Do you see any kind of shift in the hit ratios during the course of this year?\nBrian MacLean: Yeah, I think that\u2019s a function of two fundamental things. One is, there are clearly some distressed carriers out there and without question, more of their businesses in the market than would be traditionally so. So a lot of business in play, and they are doing the logical thing which is competing very aggressively to keep it. But we\u2019re getting our shot at reporting on it and we\u2019re writing some of it when we feel we can get it at the right rates terms conditions. I think the other thing is, we feel pretty confident about our capabilities in the marketplace, and so really starting over two years ago we started to see more flow. We have been much more aggressive in pushing out more products and being more proactive with the agents. And I think that\u2019s really made a difference. So, I think it is those things together that are driving the flow. And the market conditions are kind of as we just talked about.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: I mean, on the hitters when you\u2019re losing the pace of business, are you finding the Delta between your price and perhaps the incumbent carrier is getting greater, is it less, are you barely mission it or is it?\nBrian MacLean: In general, it\u2019s not, barely missing it. I would say we win the jump off more often than not.\nJay Fishman: This is a bit anecdotal because we actually do keep track of hit ratios very precisely, what we don\u2019t keep track of because we don\u2019t always know. What we don\u2019t keep track of is the extent to which when we don\u2019t take business, whether we lost a price or frankly we lost for something else. So, what we\u2019re answering here is an anecdotal. In some cases price may be the same but coverage limits may be a lot higher. We don\u2019t know how to answer that other than anecdotal observation from what we\u2019re hearing in the marketplace. So our sense is, I mean marketplace meeting our own folks, sort of a reports from our own folks say when we\u2019re close, we\u2019re in there. And when we\u2019re not close we\u2019re not.\nBrian MacLean: And don\u2019t take our comments to imply that hit ratio is plummeting. I mean flow is going up a little bit and hit ratio is coming down a little bit.\nJay Fishman: And again, forgetting about the hit ratio for a second, what I find encouraging is that this has been, in this more challenging market over the last couple of years, the product development whether it is Quantum Auto, Quantum Home, Travelers Express, the new products in middle market, these things have made a difference. They have clearly and we have seen it, they have clearly made a difference in the amount of business that we have an opportunity on which to quote. The more challenged competitive environment, and by that I mean, the position of certain other companies has certainly augmented that. It is very difficult for us to sort out how much is a result of our product work in development and how much is in fact the flight to quality, but it is pretty clear to us they are both working. And the notion that we could in fact see improving margins. And Joe by the way, made a very good point earlier, Brian, said improving margins from where they would have been if rate hadn\u2019t picked up.\nBrian MacLean: Right.\nJay Fishman: That doesn\u2019t mean the rate in picture. That\u2019s right. The rate is still negative. We\u2019re still not above that zero line, but nonetheless, that rate line picks up, it is improving margins to where they otherwise would have been. The combination of an underwriter\u2019s willingness to be more aggressive in the marketplace because they feel better about the rate picture combined with that increased flow has the potential, no prediction here, has the potential of being pretty powerful. And that\u2019s exciting to us and we will see. Maybe it occurs, maybe it doesn\u2019t. But my comment about being well positioned really speaks to that. We\u2019re seeing more flow. We have got the things we need to deliver on it and as price changes underwriters\u2019 attitudes will also and that can be pretty powerful.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Hi. Just two quick questions, if I may. First, on the FI or actually the way you term the high risk professional lines book. Can you give us a sense of loss ratio wise, what your booking it at in the fourth quarter?\nJay Fishman: I don\u2019t think that we have broken down loss ratio at that level. I don\u2019t have the data handy actually and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re inclined to disclose loss ratio at that ground level.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Could you just maybe provide color because you made a big comment with respect to the whole book that you still expect the book to be profitable, I think you said in \u201809 in one of the comments in the press release. So, I just be curious whether or not that comment would then hold for the at risk book.\nJay Fishman: When we make that comment we\u2019re making a comment with respect to the portfolio overall and intentionally not breaking it out into any particular piece. And really the sense we\u2019re trying to give you there is that there are no shocks coming to that book and that will continue to be a profitable book as a portfolio. We weren\u2019t intending to give you a more granular, but I mean it is insurance in the following sense. Once you begin to identify the accounts that are likely to have losses, it becomes unlikely that, that book narrowly defined would be profitable. I mean ultimately insurance is a combination of those accounts that have losses, and those accounts that don\u2019t. And what you have actually just kind of asked is if you identify those accounts that you think are going to have losses, do you think that they will still be profitable. The answer I think is pretty obviously no.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Yeah, then I get the large numbers. I guess my question is to one thing we\u2019re all sitting from here is, it is one thing to say the losses in the financial institution book even if things go bad may not really be that material from an earnings standpoint. I frankly I would agree with that. But I guess the only thing I\u2019m trying to get that is trying to get a gauge of if I think there are going to be losses there, whether or not how big the Delta is me and you, either side. So, that\u2019s just what I am struggling with.\nJay Fishman: No, I mean I understand the direction of your question, and I simply come back to kind of Alan\u2019s comments. If you can take a look at the FPII business broadly, and the detail that\u2019s been provided here with respect to \u201808. And I don\u2019t think it is terribly difficulty to analytically make a projection on into \u201809. There is an observation in here that \u201808 claim activity was about the same as \u201807. We made a comment about how the \u201807 estimate has developed, short of saying that accounts with losses have losses. I think we have really tried to give you, not for the purpose of giving you information, but there is enough information here to have a view on how FPII would perform next year.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. The other, just with respect to the Lloyd\u2019s business and I know the capital is moving around a lot because of the currency, but is that is a business where not as you think about allocating capital in \u201809 you\u2019re likely to increase your appetite?\nJay Fishman: If you\u2019re holding constant that the capital requirement from the appetite in the business, then I would say that you wouldn\u2019t expect a significant change in the appetite, may be we will pick up a little bit, but I don\u2019t think that we would expect the whole sale change there.\nJay Benet: I think the Lloyd\u2019s business just like all of our business is subject to internal capital allocations and the returns that we calculate based upon premiums and loss estimates going forward. So, we will factor in to those processes, whatever the costs are associated with it. And in the case of Lloyds, what we and other carriers use instead of part capital or letters of credit that support the Lloyd\u2019s business. So in our case, what you will see is a higher cost associated with those letters of credit. But again, it is all factored into the pricing line.\nJay Fishman: And I think that is the relative of the point, which is we\u2019re not capital constrained in any way, if there are business opportunities to write more business in Lloyd\u2019s at attractive prices. We can and we will. There is nothing that limits our ability to do more business, to write more profitable business there or frankly in any line of business that we have. We\u2019re in an unusual position, when evidenced by the share repurchases of actually being in a position where we\u2019re still generating excess capital. Well, if we can write more insurance business, we\u2019re all for it. We love the business. And if we can do it profitably and thoughtfully, we will.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay. And then last one if I can sneak it in if just\u2026\nGabriella Nawi: Matt, you know what we got four more other people. So, can you take it offline?\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: All right, that\u2019s fine.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Good morning. There has been a lot of conversation by many of your peers about hiring teams that have a number of companies including AIG. But, I was wondering if you are participating in that process, as well as, so many of your other peers are?\nJay Fishman: There are certainly people from AIG who have joined us. There are people from other companies who have joined us. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re out hunting for teams of people to bring in teams of people in books, but we are an organization of 33,000 employees. There are always people from other carriers who come and join us. So I wouldn\u2019t, my answer to the question is yeah, we\u2019ve had people from AIG join. But I wouldn\u2019t particularly perceive that is hiring teams of people to bring in books of business.\nGabriella Nawi: Sorry, in the interest of time, because we want to get everybody in, just, if you could just keep it to one question and make it the one you really want the answer so. So Paul, I didn\u2019t warn you, so I give you one more, but then we got a couple of other people.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill: No, no. Go ahead with the next. I play nice.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you.\nJay Fishman: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.\nMeyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Thanks. Good morning. I hope you didn\u2019t discuss this already. Are you seeing any changes in the frequency and severity of either uninsured or underinsured motorists who then personalize?\nJay Fishman: We didn\u2019t discuss it already. And, when you go in aggregate, not something that we\u2019re seeing is significant. When you get the individual local geographies, there are always nuances, but I\u2019m assuming what you really asking is, is there something related to the economy?\nMeyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: Right.\nJay Fishman: Which is causing there to be a higher number of uninsured or underinsured motorists in the environment, and at this point through our book, we\u2019re not seeing that. Is that \u2013 was that what you were targeting?\nMeyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus: That\u2019s exactly it. Thank you.\nJay Fishman: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen going forward, but we\u2019re not seeing it, in our experience yet.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Joshua Shanker with Citi. Please proceed.\nJoshua Shanker - Citi: Thank you. The question is that it\u2019s easy I suppose, but maybe a longer answer. What do you like in terms of the investment space and how much risk is appropriate for Travelers in viewing, suppose an investment corporation rather than an insurance corporation?\nBrian MacLean: Well, I\u2019ll start with two observations and that is the first. We\u2019ve always believed that we are an insurance company, which invest its money, rather than an investment organization, funded by insurance premiums. Second, as we look at the landscape, we\u2019re looking to buy assets of the type we bought before, at better prices, rather than to buy assets that we wouldn\u2019t have bought before, and simply because they are now at lower prices. In terms of looking at risk, we think risk is a combination of price and reasonably expected scenarios. And simply because price is lower, it doesn\u2019t mean the combination has changed. And paradoxically, we could look at assets selling at much lower prices than they sold much lower a year or two ago. And conclude that, they are even riskier now. But that being said, we think there will be opportunities, believe it or not in private equity, although to capitalize on them, one will likely have to have commitments to funds existing now which we do. We think there will be opportunities in high-grade corporate debt. We\u2019re worried about, so-called distressed assets notwithstanding the rush into them because we think that corporate reorganizations may be very different, the lack of dis-financing maybe, the recoveries are lower, more companies are liquidated as oppose to reorganize. And the world that you enter when an obligation defaults maybe very different than the one you entered two years ago, when it defaulted. And therefore, we like not to experience that. We were certainly solicited by every opportunity fund in the last year or so and passed on them. They either performed poorly or grew up. I guess the short answer is we\u2019re going to do very much what we\u2019ve been doing, and just hope we get better prices.\nJoshua Shanker - Citi: And no indications on which asset classes we should just be referring to, want to give us any idea?\nBrian MacLean: I think you could make a case that every asset class is cheaper than it was. Our allocation is not likely to change a great deal.\nJoshua Shanker - Citi:  Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital. Please proceed.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: Hi, everybody. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the impact of the economy on both, your business and strategically what it might do to your competitors. I guess, I\u2019m thinking in a couple of areas. One is just, if there is less exposure in the industry and therefore less growth, but you have -- you still spend a same amount of time servicing account that would seem to cause some expense pressures for yourselves. So, how are you dealing with that? And then competitively, you\u2019re obviously faced with a large number of very small competitors. Could this be a crushing blow to them and that they can\u2019t -- the lack of skill they have already, does this make the scale benefit that you have even more compelling? And then operationally for you guys, how might we see, maybe as claiming behavior changes, maybe some of those truckers are facing bankruptcy and become more aggressive in their claims or maybe the automated underwriting box, isn\u2019t quite calibrated for a different economic environment, doesn\u2019t perform as well as you like. Are there things you\u2019re doing operational reviews to make sure the people at the field level are aware that, your business might respond a little bit differently than it would in a more normal economic environment?\nJay Fishman: I will take a shot at it. Let me and just to give everybody notice, Jay -- after I finish the question or we finish the question, Jay Benet is going to I hope provide some other insight into the bond and financial products loss ratio. Some of the questions, I think have been centering on this and there may be some confusion. And I think he can add some clarity to it. So, we\u2019ll get to that as soon as we finish. First, in the context of our own business, I have enough trouble figuring out what\u2019s going on in our own shop, forgets trying to figure out what\u2019s going on in other people\u2019s shops. But I can tell you in our shop that volume is up, not volume being written, but flow is up. And so, underwriters are busy. It is not as if the moment, we have a lot of excess capacity, sitting around in the field, waiting for something to happen. Universally, everyone I talk to in the field and the people I interact with are folks are reviewing accounts, they are out in the market, they are visiting with agents, and it\u2019s not a quiet time, at the instant. And that\u2019s driven again by our own product development over the last several years. And I think some of the competitive challenges that you see which have caused agents to shop certain accounts more dynamically than perhaps they might have in the past. That\u2019s pattern that we have talked about in the third quarter and it continued on into the fourth.  The claim organization is in fact, I would say busy, they\u2019ve got -- so there\u2019s still the [remnants] of Ike and Gustav and all the rest of the cat season that we dealt with this year. So, in terms of resources in our organization, people are hopping and there is not a lot of idle time.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: So, are they getting paid less dollars for the amount of work they are doing, just because if the account that might have 500 employees and now has 400 employees, they\u2019re doing the same amount of work, but less premium dollars associated with it.\nJay Fishman: Yeah, again, and this is an important thing to understand. As I said before, I would anticipate exposure continuing to decline. But remember that a dollar of exposure has lost costs associated with it. For instance, one of the great and in fact normality\u2019s of our business, if you lose $100 in premium with losses associated with it, you\u2019ve got business that\u2019s even on the margin in a 85 combined ratio, you\u2019ve got $0.85 in saved losses and 15 points in commission that\u2019s saved and premium taxes that aren\u2019t paid. So, the bottom-line impact of exposure, it\u2019s not zero, but it is not nearly as powerful as people think. And of course, you see that on the way up. When we add exposure, it doesn\u2019t change the bottom-line as quickly or as dramatically as some people think it will, the marginal costs for dynamic in our business is pretty high. Make a distinction between that and rate. Rate is extremely powerful from the bottom-line perspective. You pay 15 points round numbers of commission, and the rest falls to the pretax line. So a point of rate, quite, quite powerful in terms of profitability, a point of exposure, far less powerful in terms of profitability. So, as we look at the situation right now, and again, not forecasting, but what we\u2019ve seen in the last several months, is generally speaking improving rate and declining exposure, that remains pretty powerful from a margin perspective.\nBrian MacLean: And some of it is, as Jay said, we\u2019re obviously speaking to our length. So, if you\u2019re a company that has got a significantly different as in lower retention experience than we have got, that pressure is going to be a lot more intense. But we are keeping the business that we want to keep and we have got lots of opportunities. And so, we feel pretty good about it.\nJay Fishman: And in the context of a recession, certainly we have talked this before, our trucking business is already reflecting declining volumes and some higher losses, and has for some time. That\u2019s not a new dynamic in our Northland operation. If you speak, very, very broadly about recessionary times, experience suggests that workers comp losses tend to rise. That is a phenomenon that we have seen before. And that may be, I said, I think about our book of business, the principal loss dynamic. Again I will put the surety business also to aside for a second because that has its own unique dynamics that can be somewhat more severity-driven. You can have an individual name obviously get into financial distress.  But if you\u2019re looking for a pattern, I would say workers comp loss is rising. We watch for that and try to underwrite to it.\nBrian MacLean: Yeah, in consistent with Joe\u2019s comment on the loss trends of specifically the UM, UIM stuff, but more broadly we\u2019re obviously watching very, very closely our claim experience. We see little, but not dramatic impacts from the economy. We expect that they will become more dramatic. Many of those are negative. Some of them are actually positive. People drive less, etcetera. But we\u2019re watching closely, but there haven\u2019t been big spikes. Trucking is one where we have been seeing experience.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: I know we\u2019re out of time, but just quickly, is it easier or harder for you to identify those changes, and that after you do more automated underwriting. Does the automation make it easier to spot or does the lack of underwriters going scrubbing every account one-by-one and you don\u2019t get anecdotal information make it harder?\nJoe Lacher: It probably makes it easier in the businesses where we\u2019re doing it because you can capture the data in a more consistent fashion, but it does make it different. I\u2019m not arguing that one is necessarily better than the other, but it does make it very different in terms of what you have to do to see it and spot it. Anecdotal information by its nature is anecdotal and colored and harder to assimilate rapidly and have a consistency to it. And when you\u2019re dealing with smaller accounts with a large, large numbers applies, that becomes very distorted. So, we feel better about it there. What you get in this and it is why we built significant product management organizations and a significant investment in our management information infrastructure is the ability to crunch all the data and look at it. There are different things, symptoms that push sometimes in different directions. As Brian points out, we may see less driving exposure in an auto environment. But over time, we\u2019re less likely to see less maintenance investment as people can\u2019t quite afford the brake job or the new set of tires. So that may push up, one pushes down frequency, one pushes up. They will come at different periods of time along that economic downturn and we\u2019re watching for all of those different components very carefully.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: Very thorough answer. Thank you, guys.\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. The thing I wanted to add some color to, just to look, to take some of Jay\u2019s comments about, if you look at businesses that have loss, of course, they have losses. And if you look at other businesses, within FPII in particular, because Alan had Tom had said, this is a very diversified portfolio. So we don\u2019t want to give the impression that when you look at FPII\u2019s combined ratio of 87.2, that that\u2019s uniform amongst all the different businesses within FPII. We certainly don\u2019t close our eyes to the loss experience of any one of these individual businesses. And what you\u2019re seeing in our numbers or potentially not seeing in our numbers is that.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: But we\u2019re seeing that you may not, you don\u2019t have access to.\nJay Benet: Is that when you look at things like the financial institutions book, the professional liability book, public company liability book within, I mean there are some higher loss ratios, combined ratios associated with those businesses that are being offset by very favorable results because of the lack of loss activity that is taking place in areas like commercial surety and construction services. So, this is all blending as Alan said to the 87.2. But we don\u2019t want to give anyone the impression that we\u2019re not fully looking at the loss experience that is taking place in some of these businesses.\nJay Fishman: The financial institutions portion of bonded financial products. Its combined ratio reflects the loss experience that we\u2019re speaking about here. So, does the professional liability book within bond and professional products. And if you\u2019re asking if those were profitable as I said before, no in 2008, those individual books of business within bonded financial products were not. But the commercial surety business was. The construction services business was. The private and nonprofit bonding financial product business was. So there is a big book with lots of lines and those two lines, to Jay\u2019s point do reflect the claims, experience and the adverse development that we anticipate in those lines. I think that will be helpful in understanding how the numbers roll together.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that concluded the question-and-answer period for today\u2019s conference. I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi for closing remarks.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you all for joining. And before we go, Matt Heimermann, I owe you an apology and you will get first call next quarter. Also, if you have any other questions, please refer to myself or Andy Hersom.

(Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Miss Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. \nGabriella Nawi: Welcome to the Travelers discussion of the third quarter 2008 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.  With me today is Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Joe Lacher, head of our Personal and Select Businesses; as well as other members of senior management. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through the prepared remarks and then we will open it for questions.  Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forwardlooking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts may be forwardlooking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance are forwardlooking, and we may make other forwardlooking statements about company results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company's reserves, and other topics.  The company cautions investors that any forwardlooking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10Q and 10K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forwardlooking statements.  Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be nonGAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the investor section on our website, travelers.com. With that, I will turn it over to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Before we get into the specific results, let me start this morning with something of a view from 40,000 feet. The last several months have been unprecedented in financial market dislocation and its impact on the financial services community broadly. We have seen upheaval at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG. We have seen governments all around the world step up and commit trillions of dollars to financial institutions that previously appeared to be pillars of strength.  Given all of this turmoil, the speed with which it has happened, and the number of pitfalls challenging the financial services industry over these months, we couldn't be more pleased with the way Travelers has managed through this dislocation. The success that we have had has little to do with anything that we have done these last several months, but rather result from the philosophy and culture that has existed here for a long time.  We are first and foremost an insurance underwriting organization, and the skills to do that successfully are at the highest level here. Our investment function as best articulated by Bill Heyman, our Chief Investment Officer himself, is in business to support our insurance underwriting operations and to do so with an extraordinarily balanced view of risk and return.  That philosophy has kept our investment decisions straightforward and simple and viewed towards providing consistent and appropriate risk-adjusted returns over time rather than responding to the investment idea of the day. Simply put, we focused on providing quality products and service to our agents and customers and building a longterm value of our franchise. We couldn't be more proud of what we have accomplished and the fact that we have come through this as a strong, resilient, wellcapitalized company. The results for this year speak for themselves. For the 9month period, we posted net income of $2.1 billion and a return on equity of 10.9%. All of our financial strength indicators are at or better than target levels, including our holding company liquidity, now just in excess of $2 billion, which is approximately twice our target level. For the quarter, we posted operating income of $330 million after tax, or $0.55 per share. As we previously reported, the third quarter was meaningfully impacted by $682 million after tax of storm losses from Hurricanes Ike, Gustav, and Dolly. However, the losses from these storms were consistent overall with our risk models and pricing assumptions. Given our size, storm losses such as these will occur from time to time.  While difficult financial market conditions impacted our net investment income to some extent for the quarter, and Jay will speak about that in a bit, our insurance underwriting operations continue to be pretty much consistent with what we saw in the second quarter; and it's very much steady as it goes. Retentions remain high across virtually all of our businesses, and the loss cost and rate changes generally continued in pattern with the second quarter.  The story, however, is less about the results of the third quarter than the positioning of this organization. Our underwriting discipline, both with respect to investing and insurance was clearly evident this quarter. Our net realized investment losses of $133 million after tax were quite modest when compared with our overall investment portfolio, and the change in our unrealized losses was driven largely by general changes in spreads rather than issue or issuerspecific deterioration. As evidence of our underwriting strength, excluding the impacts of catastrophes and net favorable prior year reserve development, our combined ratio was 91.8%.  As a result of specific initiatives, we continue to see a significant flow of new business opportunities. We're fortunate to have ample liquidity, capital, and the ability to respond to the market. We are, of course, in the property casualty business with all the risks and opportunities that entails. But all things considered, even with 20/20 hindsight, there isn't much we would have done differently. As a consequence, we're as well positioned as we could be. We remain committed to producing shareholder value by seeking to achieve mid-teens return on equity over time. Since January 1, 2005, our cumulative operating return on equity now stands at approximately 15%. We are going to keep our comments very brief today, especially since there really hasn't been much change in the insurance environment broadly. We'll leave ample time to answer any questions you have. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Jack. Let me begin by reiterating that our investment portfolio and our balance sheet continue to be in terrific shape, despite the turmoil that's been taking place in the financial market. Page 4 of the webcast shows that we ended the quarter with almost $25.5 billion of common equity excluding FAS 115 and book value per share excluding FAS 115 of $43.34, up 5% yeartodate even after $2 billion of share repurchases and $535 million of stock dividends. Our operating company capital remains at or above all of our target levels, and we continue to generate significant amount of excess capital and liquidity. Our debttototal capital ratio is 19.9% at the end of the quarter, compared to our 20% target, which is the midpoint of a 15% to 25% range that the derived from our doubleA ratings target. Holding company liquidity was $2.1 billion or almost twice our target of one year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends. We expect to be able to use internal funds to retire all debts scheduled to mature during the next three years. We're not relying on the commercial paper market and participate at a very modest level, generally $100 million or below only when rates are attractive. Page 5 of the webcast shows that composition of our investment portfolio at different points in time, along with certain of its characteristics. Composition of the portfolio has been very stable in the periods shown. Total fixed income comprising 94% and nonfixed income 6% of the total portfolio. Its quality has been maintained at doubleA plus. Its duration has been very steady, and the below investment grade portion of the fixed income portfolio is actually decreased to only 2.4%. It remains a very well diversified portfolio across industries, investment types, and individual issuers. Having said this, our portfolio is not immune from recent market changes. In this quarter, we did experience net realized losses of $116 million after tax, mostly related to impairments of Lehman and a small number of other fixed income holdings. The unrealized loss on that portion of our investment portfolio, for which estimated market value is less than 80% of amortized costs, now stands at $270 million, up from $52 million at the end of the second quarter and mostly in this position for 30 days or less. Still a small fraction of both total investments and shareholders' equity. We've always maintained the very rigorous process for identifying investments for which writedowns should be considered and take such actions when appropriate. At the end of the current quarter, we had pretax unrealized investment losses of $1.3 billion compared to a net unrealized gain of $86 million at the end of the second quarter. This change in unrealized, which will not reflect in net income, is reflected in shareholders' equity pursuant to FAS 115. This is primarily the result of credit spreads widening broadly during the quarter and, to a lesser extent, other unrealized losses widely distributed among issuers and not generally reflective of significant issuance or specific credit problem. I would also like to point out that no single corporate issuer accounted for more than $40 million of the net unrealized loss at the end of the quarter. We've updated page 6 of the webcast to include additional areas of concern that have emerged this quarter in the financial market and their impact or lack thereof to Travelers. We dramatically curtailed our securities lending program during the quarter, based on current market conditions to where we only have $15 million outstanding. We experienced no losses in this program during the quarter and we do not expect any. Also, we are not a party to any credit default swaps. As the slide indicates, we also remain unaffected by the other areas of market disruption discussed in prior quarters. As the data of page 7 indicates, both CATs and net favorable prior year reserve developments played a meaningful role in our results this quarter. CAT losses of $682 million net of reinsurance and after tax which mostly related to Hurricanes Ike, Gustav, and Dolly, added 19.1 points to our GAAP combined ratios this quarter. A net favorable prior year reserve development of $210 million after tax resulting from betterthanexpected loss experience in each of our business segments reduced our GAAP combined ratio by 6.2 points.  On a yeartodate basis, our GAAP combined ratio, even including the large CAT losses we have experienced during the year, was a very healthy 94%. Ex CATs, net favorable prior year reserve developments and last year's timing impact of the change to the fixed valuebased agent compensation program, our GAAP combined ratio was 92.5%, an increase of 2.4 points from the prior year period. We remain very pleased with the underlying profitability of our business. Page 8 of the webcast shows components of operating return on equity. Fixed income, net investment income, less interest expense remained the major driver of yeartodate operating ROA. This passage of time component produced an 8.7% return in the current period, down slightly from the prior two years due to lower shortterm interest rates. A much smaller contributor to operating ROE, both historically and yeartodate, is nonfixed income investment income, which produced a very small positive return yeartodate, down from prior periods as expected and due to current market conditions.  Underwriting income provided a return of 3% yeartodate, down from recent periods, due to the very high weatherrelated losses which offset underlying underwriting margins that were very healthy and high levels of net favorable prior year reserve development. Cumulatively from January 2005, we have produced a 15% annual operating ROE, consistent with our stated longerterm goal of mid-teens ROA. Net investment income for the third quarter, as shown on page 9, was $587 million after tax or $137 million lower than the prior year quarter. Longterm fixed income related NII of $592 million was unchanged while the shortterm component of fixed income NII was down $27 million due to the lower shortterm interest rates. The major variance between the two periods was the low level of nonfixed income related NII due to lower real estate hedge funds and private equity partnership returns in the current economic environment. Finally, our after tax yield was 3.2% for the quarter. With that, let me turn the mike over to Brian and Joe for discussion of the underlying fundamentals of our businesses.\nBrian MacLean: Before Joe and I get into the business results, let me take a few minutes to give some broad background. The highlight is that our results, especially as they relate to the top line, remain stable. I know that sounds out of pattern with the mood around broader economic trends, but our fundamentals are the same ones we have been describing for the last several years. That is, we are retaining our customers at historically high levels and at close to expiring price and are seeing a healthy flow of new business. This stability is partially a function of the market in which we compete, but also we believe a function of who we are. That is, a company with solid financial performance whose people are not distracted by franchise changing events, but instead are focused on consistently executing on our strategy in their market place. Given this dynamic, Joe and I will spend a little less time than usual on the actual numbers and leave more time for Q and A.  Looking at the details on slide 10, you can see that the retentions remain high across all our commercial business. The only exception is our international operations, where retention was down from last year due to competitive market conditions impacting our Lloyd\u2019s business and the intentional nonrenewal of certain property business in Canada. The renewal price change data reflects both rate and exposure changes. Underlying rate changes were consistent with and, in some cases, modestly improved from last quarter. In the aggregate exposure change, which fundamentally measures our account insurable interests, was also consistent.  We are seeing in a few of our businesses signs of a contracting of economic environment. For example, in owneroperated commercial trucking, we've seen an increase in business failures. In our construction book, although account retentions and new business opportunities have been strong, payrolls are declining. So, overall, a very stable renewal book of business. Slide 11 shows that our new business dollars are essentially flat last quarter. As we have talked about in previous quarters, the overall flow of new business opportunities has been up in nearly all our businesses and that trend continues this quarter. For example, flow to our small commercial platforms increased 78% over 2006, while several of our middle market businesses have seen a 50% increase in submissions over the last two years. Some of the middle market increase in this quarter is attributable to volatility among certain carriers, but most is consistent with the positive trends that we've been seeing over the last several years. Our new product offerings, platform enhancements, and strong positioning with agents and customers are driving these opportunities. This level of deal flow is a clear competitive advantage for the company. As we have previously discussed, pricing on new business continues to gradually deteriorate. As a result, our hit ratio, or the percentage of these quotes that we're writing, has declined. This demonstrates that in light of the pricing deterioration, we have maintained our underwriting discipline focusing on insuring new business that meets our criteria. These dynamics, that is, significantly increased deal flow with a lower hit ratio, resulted in a slight increase in net written premiums and business insurance segment and you can see the details on slide 12. Slide 13 shows operating income and combined ratios for business insurance. The adjusted combined ratio was 92.7 for the quarter, 2.3 points worse than the third quarter last year, but still at a very healthy level. The margin compression is due to the modest decline in pricing and modest increase in loss trends that we had expected. The atypical property loss activity, which we had seen in the first two quarters, returned to normal levels this quarter. On the expense side, after considering the [wind pool] assessments from Hurricane Ike and the timing impact of the agent compensation, our expense ratio is consistent with previous quarters. Overall, we continue to have very solid margins. Turning to financial, professional, and international insurance on slide 14, premiums were down slightly, minus 2% from last year's quarter. The adjusted combined ratio was a solid 93.8%, but has deteriorated 4.2 points from the same quarter last year. This variance is primarily attributable to a small number of thirdquarter large losses that exceeded expectations in Lloyd's as well as developments on large losses that occurred in the first half of the year. Although the large loss experience continues to run ahead of normal levels, the activity did mitigate in the third quarter. Additionally, I would note that the surety and professional liability loss ratios were on plan and none of the deterioration is from these businesses. A brief comment on the quarter's storm activity, estimates of CAT losses are detailed in the appendix and are obviously dominated by losses from Hurricane Ike. Our losses for all these storms were consistent overall with our risk models, our market shares, and assumptions used in our pricing. For a little added context, our Hurricane Ike loss assumes a $3.5 billion event per the Texas Wind Storm Insurance Association. In summary, we believe our commercial segment performed well and our results remained extremely solid. With that, let me turn it over to Joe Lacher for the Personal Insurance results.\nJoe Lacher: As Brian mentioned, our results have exhibited a great consistency in recent quarters. We believe this comes from a focused execution on the key success drivers in our business. I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing how this played out in Personal Insurance starting on page 15. We reported an operating loss of $64 million in the quarter, which was down $340 million when compared to last year's third quarter. Cash for the activity represents $292 million of this decrease. We also experienced a decline in net investment income of $20 million. As you can see on page 15, our expense ratio in the quarter was 35%. The increase of 7 points versus third quarter of 2007 was driven by a couple of nonrecurring things.  First, about 5.5 points relates to hurricanerelated assessments that flowed through taxes, licenses, and fees and ultimately the expense ratio. Second, just under 1 point relates to the accounting impact of our supplemental commission program. Outside of all of these items, our results are consistent with prior quarters. You can see this from looking at the change in invested combined ratio for the quarter and yeartodate. Turning to our production results, written premium was up 5% in the quarter, a bit above the 3% growth level seen yeartodate. Switching to page 16, let's look at some of the more detailed production statistics. Our property business has been a machine that continues to crank out results despite difficult market conditions. With the broad slowdown in home sales and a tighter credit market, we would typically expect pressure on the property production. Against this headwind, policies in force grew 3%, new business volumes were up nearly 7% versus prior year quarter. Our retention at 86%, renewal price change of plus 6% were strong and consistent with prior quarters.  We remain pleased with the continuing growth of the Quantum Home product and its ability to increase new business volume. Quantum Home policies now represent more than 12% of our policies in force. We're similarly pleased with our auto results. Our leading product sophistication, our deep and expanding agency relationship, and our strong business platform continue to enable or deliver robust results. New business volume was up nearly 13%, and policies in force grew 3% versus the prior year quarter. Renewal price change increased from the second quarter to plus 3%, and retention remained in line with recent quarters. Quantum Auto policies now represent more than 43% of our policies in force. Overall, we continue to make investments in our business infrastructure and distribution capabilities to fuel our longterm profitable growth. Turning briefly to page 17, auto loss trend results remain generally consistent with recent quarters. Excluding the impact from the broader risk profile of Quantum, our total loss trend in the quarter was essentially flat. Our frequency declined slightly, and our total severity trend increased slightly. Overall, we remain pleased with the fundamentals of our Personal Insurance business and look forward to building on that success. With that, I will turn it back to over to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Page 18 provides updated information concerning our guidance for the full year 2008. We now expect fully diluted operating income per share will be in the range of $4.90 to $5.10, which incorporates actual yeartodate results and translates into an operating return on equity of approximately 11.5% to 12%. We're assuming the continuation of current lower shortterm interest rates and the more challenging environment we experienced in the third quarter for nonfixed income investment return.  Also, notwithstanding our financial strength and liquidity, we are planning for a reduced level of share buyback activity in the fourth quarter. It feels prudent to allow for some additional capital formation in this volatile environment. However, depending on market conditions and how our share price performs, we may change our plan. This is not to be taken as a significant shift in our capital management strategy. Our guidance assumes fourth quarter CAT losses of $92 million pretax or $60 million after tax or $0.10 per share after tax; no further prior year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable; no significant change in average investment assets excluding FAS 115 and after approximately the $2.1 billion of share repurchases for the full year; and a revised weighted average diluted share count of approximately $610 million after the share repurchases and employee equity awards. With that, let me turn things back to Jay.\nJay Benet: Just one clarification in my prepared comments, please. I made reference to a net realized investment loss of $133 million after tax. That, of course, is the yeartodate number. The number for the quarter is $116 million after tax. I certainly didn't mean to confuse anyone. So I am correcting that for the record. With that we can open it up and take questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Josh Shanker Citi. \nJosh Shanker Citi: Back before the merger of Travelers and St. Paul, St. Paul had a reputation for writing some larger commercial business. I am wondering, given what's going on in the marketplace, whether the new Travelers has this capability in this way and you're looking at what could be a market opportunity, what that means for you.\nJay Fishman: First, I will make an observation. That may have been a reputation; I have not heard it before. It's not a correct one. St. Paul was a middle market and small commercial underwriter with a focus more on specialty businesses than general commercial. But it was not a large account casualty and, frankly, when I got there, I am not even insure it had a national account property business. That was not the case. As it relates to the company today, our sweet spot remains middle market accounts and small commercial accounts in the commercial arena. We are not a large account casualty writer, broadly speaking that is. The reason for that is that we find it difficult to understand how we can achieve a portfolio outcome when you are dealing with large account casualty business. Risks tend to exist on an individual main basis and we struggle to get to a portfolio with that. We do write large account property business.  We're a significant writer of large account property business. Of course, we do a fair amount of servicing. A large amount of servicing for workers comp exposure to some of the largest, obviously, U.S.based accounts, workers comp being a U.S. phenomenon. I don't think that we would change our culture and our DNA to embrace a line of business that we have struggled with.  We don't dispute that other people have been successful at it and we certainly don't dispute that other people seem to have figured out a way to manage that business over a long period of time, but it's really eluded us. It's eluded us for a long period of time. So, we don't have a great focus of expanding our business orientation into the large account casualty world, particularly any more aggressively than we currently do. Brian, do you want to add anything?\nBrian MacLean: I will admit, I am also a little concerned when we broad brush where we are in the market. So we do stuff for large accounts, but as Jay said, it's property, it's heavily focused on the casualty side. On servicing, we take some risks. In the aggregate, we are much more of a modest player there. Our sweet spot is clearly middle market business and small commercial.  Broadly, to your question, I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in the marketplace we go forward. Many of which will be in markets and in products that we are very comfortable with and are anxious to look at and to look to expand. We are not fundamentally looking to change who we are and venture out into things that are on the outer limits of what we excel at.\nJosh Shanker Citi:\n :\nJay Benet: I will turn it over to Bill Heyman in one second. I think the answer broadly is that, as I mentioned in my comments, we are a risk and return oriented organization. To the extent that returns move to a level that make taking additional risks more appropriate, we are certainly openminded to doing so. But it will always be done in the simple and straightforward way that we have so far.\nBill Heyman: I think notwithstanding all that has occurred in the market, as we look out across the opportunities we see each day, we find the market to be pretty efficient. There are not a lot of free lunches being offered. Obviously if we see one, we take it. While corporate strength has widened, treasury rates, if anything, have stayed historically low. Absolutely fixed income securities are, by historical standards, not very attractive. We look at a number of asset classes where we have only toeholds and would like to get bigger. They, too, have been priced pretty efficiently. The other small bank loan portfolio and the bank loan market has been decimated. A lot of the loans are credit one wouldn't want, even at these prices. We are doing pretty much every day what we have done every day for the last five years. See what comes across the transom that meet some absolute standards of risk and reward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jay Gelb Barclays Capital.\nJay Gelb Barclays Capital: Jay, I had a broad question on the cycle turn. I've heard some chatter among the reinsurers that the combined impact of AIG's dislocations and the broader financial issues in the market, plus catastrophe losses, are going to lead to a cycle turn in reinsurance as of 1/1. Do you subscribe to that view? I am not sure what your views are on the reinsurance side, but on the primary side you can address that. Do you think there's enough capital that's come out to cause a cycle turn?\nJay Benet: Yogi Berra once said it's really hard to predict and especially so when you talk about the future. I don't know. I can tell you what our mindset is as an individual company. How the overall market responds and how other carriers react to it is for them to speak to. We're not a big enough competitor that any change that we take in the marketplace is going to drive the market in any particular direction. We're approaching the world as a riskier place they than it was 12 months ago. If you recognize that and you try and bring that philosophy to your pricing decisions.  We're always going the support our agents and our brokers and our customers and we're going to compete. We've done, I think, a very effective job at sorting through and finding opportunities that are priced appropriately, even in a more challenging pricing environment. But we sit here as we do every month and think about pricing philosophy and it certainly seems to us to be a riskier world. We will try our best to bring that philosophy to our pricing decisions. But everyone will have their own view and perspective and the market will be what the market will be. I just don't know and I don't know. My crystal ball isn't good enough to predict what's going to be in six months.\nJay Gelb Barclays Capital: Then on the financial leverage side with debttototal capital being right around 20% and that being your stated goal. Does that constrain Travelers from buying back more stock or is there a little leeway there to go higher on debttocapital?\nJay Fishman : As I indicated in my remarks, we have a target range given our target of a double-A rating. Somewhere between 15% and 25%. We have never picked these targets either on the upside or the downside to be at a constraining level. If we were to decide that it would be appropriate to increase leverage by a point or two or three, we certainly have to capacity to do that. But we have been targeting the 20%.\nJay Benet: I would add one other comment to that because I do think it's relevant. We try, because obviously the world changes around us, we have a fundamental philosophy of not running the company on the edge. What I mean by that is not putting the company in a position from its leveraged capital perspective such that the kinds of events that inevitably happen in the property casualty industry in the ordinary course would cause us to have to do something dramatic.  We want to be comfortable being able to withstand a quarter of Ike and Gustav and Dolly. And we always remember that in 2005, it was Rita, Katrina, and Wilma. The notion that we have capacity to lever up to a higher level, that may be the case, but as we think about how we run our business and the prudent management of longterm shareholder value would dictate that we shouldn't be running it on the edge. I think where we are here is in a very appropriate level and it gives us the flexibility and the capacity to withstand the events that occur in our business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman Adage Capital.\nIan Gutterman Adage Capital: One quick financial question then a broader strategic question. Have you taken your full statutory dividend capacity for the year? If not, how much do you expect to take in Q4?\nJay Fishman: We have not taken the full capacity from the operating companies up to the holding company through the first three quarters. We do have a planned dividend level in the fourth quarter, but we're not straining the capacity to bring capital up to the holding company.  We're operating the company as we said we have previously, establishing at the operating companies target levels of capital based on rating agency requirements, riskbased capital requirements of the states. We are comfortably at or above the target. Excess capital is swept up. It's flowing and we're not being constrained.\nIan Gutterman Adage Capital: I was thinking the opposite. I was trying to think how much you have used yeartodate just so I have an idea of, if I want to try to model it, how much holding company capital would be going forward?\nJay Fishman: How much has actually come up from the operating companies to the holding company?\nIan Gutterman Adage Capital: Yes, yeartodate.\nJay Fishman: Why don't we have somebody else ask a question, and we'll give you that information.\nIan Gutterman Adage Capital: The broader question is just, there's obviously a lot of distressed properties come up for sale or may be coming up for sale. To the extent you found something just incredibly compelling and the price tag were more than your current excess capital, obviously you have some ability to take the debt up, but you don't sound superinterested in it. I am just trying to think how would you finance something that went beyond your current excess? Would it be that acquisition is a compelling reason to get a little bit closer to the edge? Is raising equity at these levels on the table at all or would it have to be just a supercompelling deal to do that? Then I have a quick followup on that. \nJay Benet: It is a supposition on top of a supposition there. Let me go back and kind of reassert. It's not any different today than it was three or six months ago, what our acquisition philosophy would be. We think it's prudent or any management, every management to be aware of opportunities in the marketplace, to be knowledgeable and to look at everything they can to be aware of what's going on. In our case, we don't need to do anything. We have the ability to meet our mission, to create shareholder value by achieving midteens return on equity over time, with what we've got.  The fact that we're a company that's significantly experienced in effecting acquisitions and effecting them successfully, I think we have a wellearned respect for the challenges that any trade brings about. It brings reserve risk and people risk and culture risk and systems risk. And you go into these things with eyes wide open with a really healthy understanding of what it takes. Our willingness to go ahead and do something would only be with a mindset that something would be compelling in making it easier to meet our mission, easier to meet our mission of achieving shareholder equity with midteens return on equity over time.  My presumption would be that any transaction that would meet that threshold that would be so compelling, it would be not difficult to finance it one way or another. I think the more challenging issue is, yes, there may in fact be a lot of properties that come up for sale. It's possible. The real challenging issue was do any of them matter? Do any of them make it easier for us to me our mission? Once we believe that, then I think the financing ultimately stands on its own. We know how to finance it in ways that are thoughtful.  I think you get into trouble trying to finance transactions that you can't figure out how they actually add to shareholder value, and then you end up to some extent chasing your tail. I would love to start off with an opportunity that's compelling, and compelling in a way that makes it easy for us to address the financing issue.\nIan Gutterman Adage Capital: I totally agree with that. I guess what I am thinking is we might be in that special environment now where some properties you thought you would never see or if you had seen it pay two times book, maybe you can get them for a shade over book. Just because they're subsidiary of their companies that have to raise capital. To be honest, my main concern is, unless it was just an absolute steal, I would hope given where your stock is trading at, raising equity is off the table.\nJay Benet: We have a very healthy regard for the cost of equity. We have at least a healthy regard for the cost of equity as any owner or analyst of our share price. We get it. We are all owners. We are all option holders. We all have a meaningful and significant stake in the company on an individual, as well as a professional level. We understand it. If anyone has any concerns that we have a disregard for the cost of capital, cost of equity, it's not us.\nIan Gutterman Adage Capital: That's what I wanted to hear. Then related to that to finish it off, given that some of these opportunities may arise or maybe you just want to be more cautious in case the markets get worse or there's a CAT or something along those lines. It would seem, frankly, the cheapest way of prefunding any of these concerns is to go buy more reinsurance, given you're taking your [retouches] up and reinsurance is still relatively cheap. It's certainly the cheapest form of capital in the world today. Are you considering as you go to 1/1 that maybe you start buying back down again in certain line of business to give you more capital flexibility for the unknown and whether it be a positive or negative unknown?\nJay Benet: We're, first of all, as it relates to our catastrophe cover, we're a July 1 company. Our CAT cover broadly won't come up until we get into the second quarter of next year.\nIan Gutterman Adage Capital: I was thinking more of the nonCAT treaties.\nJay Benet: The way, maybe we should challenge ourselves to make sure that the logic still remains in tact. But we see reinsurance as a longterm cost rather than as a longterm profit opportunity. If someone can find a dumb reinsurer and introduced them to me, I would be happy to make lunch with him. My experience is that reinsurers are pretty smart and sophisticated and they know what their product is worth and they charge appropriately for it. Ultimately, what we're doing is conveying the share of the profits of our business with a capital providing partner. If we believe that, then what we want to buy is that which, when you think of your homeowner's, your automobile insurance, you make the same decision that we do. We want to convey the volatility to someone else that we're not prepared to withstand.  I think given our capital position, our earnings profile and our size, we don't have to worry about conveying more of that volatility to anybody else. I feel very comfortable with our overall profile to the extent that we thought that some additional capital was needed, I think the kind of thing that we're doing in the fourth quarter, which you mean scaling back our share repurchases, is the least costly and least permanent way of effecting that. If someone were to ask, why are we doing it? I am not even sure I can give you a clear answer, other than to say it just feels right in these volatile times to allow for a little more capital formation rather than a little less.\nIan Gutterman Adage Capital: Agreed. To that point, since you bring it up, wouldn't it be a good trade? It doesn't say the reinsurers are dumb so much, but wouldn't it be a good trade to buy reinsurance at a low to midteens cost of capital and be able to buy back your stock well below book, which is probably a 20%30% return on capital?\nJay Benet: Again, there's a presumption in that statement that buying back that reinsurance is a capital-producing event. It may be a capital wasting event. You just don't know. Ultimately if you're buying insurance, then the coin is flipped. Maybe it comes up heads and maybe it comes up tails. Maybe the losses turn out to be better than you anticipate, and you've actually spent capital. I just struggle with coming to the conclusion that reinsurance buying is fundamentally capital generating. It may turn out to be, but ultimately if the reinsurer is doing their job well. My experience is they do their jobs well. The actuarial price that you're paying for it, is at least more than what it's worth.   I think to your point there has been a periodic tactic when reinsurance gets particularly cheap some people go out and aggressively buy more. That's a tactical decision on the premise that the losses that you're avoiding are more than the premium that you are paying for the reinsurance. That may or may not turn out true. At least as we stand right now, it's not apparent to me that reinsurance is anything now but actuarially properly priced, not cheap. I have some trouble getting to the conclusion that capital is created.\nBrian MacLean: Just to finalize the answer to the question about how much capital was at the operating companies that could be brought up without regulatory approval, this is U.S.based companies, we disclosed in our 10K for the year that there was about $4,200,000,000 that was available to be brought up without regulatory approval. Through the first three quarters of the year, we have brought up $3 billion of that.\nJay Benet: That's not $4,200,000,000, that's $4.02 billion. \nBrian MacLean: $4.02 billion. Sorry. You're absolutely right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Newsome Sandler O'Neill & Partners.\nPaul Newsome Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Two quick questions. One is could you talk about what the impact of the security lending program is on your investment income? Was it really that material? We are just trying to get my arms around this, not just for you, but for other folks who obviously do very similar things.\nBill Heyman: It was not material. It was at its peak about $600 million in magnitude. As we looked at it, our counterparties were people whose credit we were comfortable, but not too comfortable. The collateral we were getting was acceptable, but not as good as we'd like. After all that, we were taking a few basis points. Earlier this year, we took it from $600 million to $15 million. The only reason we left $15 million was we might want to get back into it again. But it was never a material driver.\nPaul Newsome Sandler O'Neill & Partners: Second question. You recently sold this Union America to, I believe, a company that runs runoff operations. Could you talk about how that affected your asbestos liabilities? I know there are a billion in gross liabilities. I don't know what the net would be or even round numbers. Does this signal a change in your view towards trying to sell these kind of runoff companies? I know Travelers was among the companies that protested for example [inaudible] sale of its runoff operations a little while ago.\nJay Benet: First, the operations were U.K. based and, as I am sure you know, U.K. transactions of this nature can be done in a way that limit the credit exposure of the company that is selling, receiving company. In this case, we have the ability to X any credit risk to transfer the underlying liabilities to the buyer, obviously subject to the regulatory approval of the FSA. We haven't closed yet. We have a contract. We announced that we have a contract. We haven't actually sold yet. I hope that we will get to a closing. I don't think it speaks to a shift in strategy or policy. This was a situation where runoff liabilities, and this wasn't enormous, it was sizable, but not enormous capture and attract capital. They have to have capital to support them. By conveying these liabilities to someone who views its as a going concern business and is willing to commit the capital to it, it frees up capital for us. The underlying liabilities for all accounts reserved properly and appropriately. It was an opportunistic transaction to move the liabilities to someone who would use it as a going concern, free up capital attached to that business for ourselves, and do so at a fair and reasonable price.\nPaul Newsome Sandler O'Neill & Partners: I think it's a good thing. Lastly. I was looking at a survey for the, telling us to put out D&O insurance. That survey suggested that you folks were actually a leader in selling to financial institutions, D&O insurance. Is that true? Is it that big a deal? Maybe you could just talk about that exposure as well.\nBrian MacLean: We certainly have a FID&O book and are watching that carefully. Are we a leader? We certainly are playing it. The larger national levels, we've been managing that book carefully over the last year or so, looking at both limits and attachment points.\nAlan Schnitzer: I think a key part of that is our limits profile and how closely we manage that. Obviously we are limiting our exposure to any one.\nJay Benet: Let me make sure, I know I have garbled this up before. Our bank exposure, not our financial institution broadly, but our bank exposure, is significantly driven by our community bank program. So far, so good. In that program, approximately 80% of the risks are private, these are nonpublic companies. We actually have more of the characteristics on that. The average size of the limits, it's not, the bank book is not driven by moneycenter banks, investment banks, banks that are actively engaged in the marketing or packaging of mortgage securities. Again, there are other financial institutions. There are insurance companies and there are a host of other things, but our banking exposure is driven by our community bank exposure.\nBrian MacLean: I just want to clarify something that's related to the securities lending program. You can get from our balance sheet how much of fixed maturity portfolio was subject to securities lending. It is $15 million as of September 30. The numbers have been considerably higher than that. The June 30 number was $1.6 billion. You can go back and look at what the values were in previous points in time. We have, in this turbulent marketplace, really curtailed [inaudible].\nAlan Schnitzer: The point is it was a very small amount of incremental profits. \nJay Benet: We viewed it as a conservatively run and managed securities lending program. Didn't involve leverage. It didn't involve further volume. It was a straightforward, traditional securities lending program. Bill actually came to me early, like in the middle of the quarter, and suggested that the ability to act on the collateral, given the turmoil and dislocation that was then in the marketplace in particular could be challenging. The collateral was okay, but if you had to act on it, it could be challenging. Given the amount of income that it was contributing, Bill made an active decision to say let's bring the program down. It was not a material contributor to our earnings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jay Cohen Merrill Lynch.\nJay Cohen Merrill Lynch: Couple questions. The first is, maybe for Bill Heyman, the change in the unrealized was frankly a lot more modest than we had expected. Given what we've seen and what we did was we looked at different indices for corporate bonds, you know double A corporate bonds, and for even munies, and we came up with a much higher number. You are not privy to our assumptions, but I am wondering if there was something about your business that allowed your unrealized losses to be a lot more modest than we have seen from others.\nBill Heyman: Actually we thought saw your estimate, although not the assumptions behind it. When we saw that number, we felt better having seen your estimate. I think we have tried in every asset class we are invested in to be as high up the food chain as possible in term of credit quality. I think while we have to benchmark ourselves against indices for lack of anything better. The credit quality, the real credit quality of the portfolio was higher than the indices. I think that accounts for most of the difference. Also, we missed some of the big blowups, and most of those would have fallen into the realized category. But nonetheless, there's some credits which have gone down in price and may have got to the point of [inaudible] in which we're underrepresented.\nJay Cohen Merrill Lynch: The second question, maybe for Brian, in the nine months, the underlying combined ratio, X cap, X development, was worse by about 2.4 points. So it's still a reasonable level. I remember initially when you were thinking about 2008, I think you were thinking for that number to get worse by about a point. Then you increased that a bit. It does seem a bit worse than what you've been expecting. One, is that accurate? Secondly, if it is, sit more of a price issue or a claims issue?\nBrian MacLean: Absolutely accurate. Let me break it down into the three basic pieces and then Joe or Jay or anybody chime in. The core underlying assumptions around price loss trend, margins on the business have essentially played out as we expected, across I would say our whole spectrum. This is broad brushing the thing. You can look at our data, pricing has softened a little bit. Pretty much in line with what we expected. We expected some loss trend. Our starting point, our base, has improved a little bit. So net net our margins are about where we thought on the core business. The large loss activity that we saw in the first half of the year in the commercial business, commercial property, running across all of our segments and a little more of that in the third quarter on the international side, is a piece of that number. Then the rest is predominantly weather driven issues in personal insurance. Again, we disclosed CAT. So it's the nonCAT weather losses that we saw run through our personal books. Those would be the major components of it. The weather stuff moves. Sometimes you have better years and sometimes you have worse years.  \nJay Cohen Merrill Lynch: So it's nonCAT weather basically.\nJoe Lacher: The combination of nonCAT weather and the large losses that we spoke about in the first half of the year, to some extent. Some of that continuing into the third. Those are the two reasons. You got it right. You started out with anticipating 100 basis point deterioration in the combined ratio. We took that up to a point and a half at the end of the first quarter. Getting from that point and a half now to the 2.4 is largely accounted for.\nBrian MacLean: Even a piece of the third quarter international large loss stuff was also weatherrelated losses that didn't hit a CAT threshold.\nJay Cohen Merrill Lynch: If I could just squeeze in one more question. If I can't, just say shut up. On your auto business, certainly, there's a big property availability, AIG's personal lines business is for sale. They've said that publicly. You are a potential buyer. One of the pieces there is the direct auto business. You probably can't comment on this specific one, in general, how would you feel about entering a direct response auto business given the potential channel conflicts.\nJay Fishman: I will give it 30 seconds and ask Joe to comment. We already do some direct business. We obviously have for a while through our [inaudible] pity businesses and certain other direct channels. We have also, in certain select states, been advertising in a way to drive some business directly. Not a significant portion of our business yet, but already in place. It's to your point, it's correct. At least historically it's been described as a channel conflict.  I think most of our agents and brokers understand the realities of what the business is going to look like over the next ten years. They understand that and get it. And what successful companies have done, and they're certainly are plenty who have navigated both of those tracks, have done so in a way that leaves the agents and brokers on a level playing field. At least as we understand it, were that to become a more important part of our business, that's an important element. You can't come to market and be adverse to the agents and brokers that have built your business. You have got to keep a level playing field. Again, independent of anything related to AIG, we've already been in the direct business to some extent.\nJoe Lacher: I would echo all those thoughts. We had a relatively significant percentage of our, not insignificant maybe would be a better way to describe it, premium that comes from nontraditional agency relationships for some time and continue to do that. We work through all of the conversations with our agents if we bump into each other. But we have an, unfortunately or fortunately, sufficiently a modest market share that those issues don't cause us a lot of problems and we figured out how to work through it this in a way that allows those channels to work together.\nJay Fishman: If we were to embrace the direct marketing strategy in a broader sense, we would obviously be forthcoming with our agents and with the brokers. We would be forthcoming as to what we were doing and we would describe it in a way that enabled us to communicate to them effectively that we are, of course, protecting and watching out for their interests.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alain Karaoglan Bank of America.\nAlain Karaoglan Bank of America:\n :\nBill Heyman: Let me interject, the people in St. Paul, Minnesota, deserve congratulations as well, especially Dave [Roland].\nAlain Karaoglan Bank of America: The question that I have relates to the surety and the D&O business. I know you mentioned, Brian, in your comments that the losses are in line with your expectations. How are you thinking in a weakening economic environment about contract and commercial surety? What should be what we are watching out for? Why shouldn't we be that concerned about it? On the D&O front, are you expecting pricing to improve, given all the pain that has been there. Just a numbers question on the tax rate on underwriting. Was this lower than expected? I calculate 27.8%. I may have calculated that wrong and can pick it up be you Gabby afterwards.\nBrian MacLean: Let us come back to the tax rate question, maybe Gabby can bet back to you unless there's a quick answer, but we'll look at that. Great questions on the surety side. Clearly we are looking very closely at that book as you all know, we are a major player there. And have been a very successful one. We have spent a lot of time talking about it. Why don't I toss it over the Alan and let him bring you up to speed on our conversation.\nAlan Schnitzer: I think the real important point to keep in mind on the surety business is this is something we've been focusing on for a long time now. This hasn't caught us by surprise. We have been looking at this and actively managing that portfolio, and our credit quality of our contract book as we measured it is at a high [inaudible] by historical standards. We feel very good about that business and how it's performing.\nJay Benet: One of the things that we've done is to broaden out the imput into looking at the business and what we've been doing in it. We've actually brought folks from Bill Heyman's organization and Bill [Hannon] who is our enterprise risk person along with people in the surety business now on a more regular basis to discuss in a much more robust way the overall credit profile and credit exposures and how they're being managed.  I think part of this is to recognize that there is real strength in this organization to do credit analysis and credit evaluation and we're bringing all of those resources to bear into the business on a regular basis.\nBrian MacLean: You also asked about pricing on the D&O book. Obviously, when you write D&O in lots of lines and it's hard to generalize. If you were thinking about the large FIs, the pricing has improved. \nJay Benet: None of us mean to predict that there will never be a surety loss. This is not to give you assurance that there won't be loss. That would be in effect foolish, but I think we approach the business and the way that we do it in a very thoughtful way. We're mindful of it and have a real healthy respect for the exposure that exists there.\nGabriella Nawi: Alain, I will get back to you on the tax rate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Meredith UBS.\nBrian Meredith UBS: I will keep mine to one question. Jay, last time, last quarter you talked a little bit about inflation out there. Looks like it's a little different environment now with oil prices down, commodity prices down. Just curious, what do you think the impact of this current environment is going to have on loss cost trend? What is loss cost trend look like in the commercial line area?\nJay Benet: There isn't anything that we saw in the third quarter that was in any way meaningfully different from what we had in the second. If you remember what we said in the second quarter, was that while we were certainly mindful of the potential for inflation, we certainly hadn't seen anything at this point that would suggest any kind of a significant spike.  That remains true. We haven't seen anything that would suggest a real spike. I do think in the context of, this is part of our responsibility to manage, in the overall environment. We've got an existing deficit that's currently projected to get to half a trillion dollars. We have got U.S. governmental making substantial infusions into financial institutions. Its impact on the deficit, the dynamic of what a different regulatory regime will have, it certainly belongs on the list of issues for us to be extremely attentive to and thoughtful about. I don't think that a reasonable person could dismiss it at this point a notion that the likelihood of any accelerated inflation, whether medical costs or otherwise, isn't a possibility. It remains on our radar screen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith Credit Suisse.\nVinay Misquith Credit Suisse: Could you expand on the opportunity that you're seeing right now since [inaudible] I think the most [inaudible]. I am curious as to what other opportunities you have seen in the market right now.\nJay Benet: First I would go back to even before this immediate quarter. We have spoken for some time that in our middle market business, if you look at some of the middle market construction, and Brian mentioned this again. The actual submission flow is up 50% from where it was two years ago. That's just extraordinarily strong. It really reflects new product development and the fact that we've become a really market of choice. Two, is the advent of Travelers Express in our small commercial business, which is a real breakthrough in speed and technology in our smallest, small commercial arena, as also precipitated a significant increase in deal flow that [inaudible] we just haven't seen. All of those things encourage agents to do more things with us that even extend beyond those two business lines. Our experience has been the more you do with agents and brokers, the more business opportunities you see from them and that is partly what we are seeing. Specifically, in the quarter, people have asked if we have seen opportunities related to the situation at AIG. I would make a couple of observations. First, our sweet spots really only intercept to some extent. You are right, we're not a large account casualty insurer, and AIG has certainly been one of the best large account casualty insurers in the world and deserve all the credit for really lending a successful business. Where we do have some overlap is in our middle markets business. They are a very good, very strong effective competitor there as are we. We have since the dislocation related to AIG seen an increase in flow of opportunities to quote on business where AIG is currently the incumbent. Our sense is that agents and brokers are looking for additional alternatives for their current AIG clients. Accounts that might have not gone to market and simply been renewed, our sense is that agents and brokers are feeling something of a responsibility to their customers to generate alternatives for them and we have seen an increase in opportunities to quote on business where AIG is currently the incumbent. To the extent it sits in our sweet spot in our middle market business we are obviously doing so.\nOperator: Your next question comes from [Terry Shu] Pioneer Investments.\n[Terry Shu] Pioneer Investments: I think most of the questions have been asked, but let me ask one more on personal lines, personal auto, specifically. You have done really well and the industry environment, maybe you can comment on that. Seems like many carriers are able to put some rate increases and right now, with the gaps that people watch, the underlying cost trends versus premiums has narrowed quite a bit. Are we just seeing a much more disciplined market and you're gaining share mostly because there's still rolling out and you still have a smaller book and therefore able to gain share? Can you just comment broadly.\nJay Benet: There's a couple of questions there. I will try to hit them all and nudge me if miss some. We are, as we observe rate activity, all of our competitors in a regulated environment would be put through filed rate increases so we can go through and see what each other have filed. There's been a shift in the recent quarter and recent several quarters towards more increases rather than decreases. I am not sure it's as broad as I sometimes describe it, but I think it's in line with what we're seeing in those same indices that you're describing that look at the aggregate results. You can see it to some degree in our RPC numbers, our renewal price change numbers, which picked up again in the quarter. I do think that's generally happening in the marketplace. \nJay Fishman: That's a little forwardlooking.\nJay Benet: Those are filed rate increases.\nJay Fishman: I am just trying to make sure people understand that dynamics.\nJay Benet: That's what happened. The question of is it a more disciplined marketplace? That becomes the forwardlooking question. And you start to say I don't know exactly what's going to happen. We have had conversations about what were oil prices going to do. What's going to happen with frequency? How is that going to play out in the marketplace? I think that, along with what's going on in the economy, will be somewhat unclear and we will have to see how that works over the course of the next couple of quarters.\nJay Fishman: The only observation there is that the first step is to get filings in place. Filings actually sometimes translate to real increases and sometimes they don't. What we look at there is what I would characterize as a leading indicator and it may or may not develop. You're not declaring.\nJay Benet: I am just saying what we've seen in the observable data that Terry was referencing. There's actual rates going up, rate increases that are actually charged. We've seen our actual RPC, and you know the filings, that's will translate into actual dollars. Who knows what's going forward. \nJoe Lacher: From our perspective in our own business, we continue to I believe bring very thoughtful capabilities into the marketplace and we're executing them well. We spent time before talking to you about our expansion of our agency plan into broader geographies. That gives us the capacity with almost in a retail perspective, we're not just dealing with same store sales, we're dealing with new store sales. As we open up those new stores, that gives us an opportunity to grow and outperform what you are seeing others doing in the marketplace without having to be unreasonably aggressive inside of those same stores. We're seeing the results bear fruit. We're confident that we can continue to march forward doing that.  And I hope we get a little bit of the effect that Jay was talking about before, as we bring the strength of our Quantum products to bear, bring Travelers Express to bear, to bring the strength of our middle market to bear. There becomes a halo effect of all of the things we do in place, propelling all of the things we do as a place to be more effective. We see that in all of our businesses.\nGabriella Nawi: It looks like the end for this. Thanks for joining us today.

With that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Thank you Gabby and welcome to the team. It is good to have you here. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased with our solid results this quarter with operating earnings of $918 million or $1.50 per diluted share, operating return on equity of 14.3% and a combined ratio of 89.3%.  Rather than focusing on specific results we posted this quarter which Jay, Brian and Joe will review with you in detail, this morning I\u2019m going to take a few minutes to share our perspective on the current operating environment.  Reviewing our first six months the underlying business has shaped up about as we had expected. Our revenue strategies are paying off in each of our segments and we see that in our retention rates which remain very high. As we outlined in Investor Day our agents and brokers are embracing our products and that is reflected in the significant increase in deal flow to us in Business Insurance, primarily from Travelers Express, our new small commercial platform and Industry Edge, our new middle market products.  In personal insurance as well our progress is evidenced by the success of Quantum Auto and Quantum Home. Nevertheless, our close rates are actually down as we have responded with discipline to the more competitive marketing business environment. We have tremendous tenure among our underwriters and we are pleased they have applied their knowledge learned during previous cycles by exercising such discipline in this market place.  So far this year rate and underwriting loss trends are generally developing as we had expected they would with some variances about which Brian will speak later. Net investment income is down as short rates declined much more than we had originally anticipated they would and returns on non-fixed income investments, while positive, remain significantly lower than last year. We continue to be extremely pleased with our asset portfolio. We are gratified that Moody\u2019s upgraded our debt and insurance financial strength ratings during the second quarter while so many other companies are being pressured to raise capital. Travelers remains very strong with a superior balance sheet and significant liquidity.  When we look out to the rest of the year we are aware of the current economic environment and the potential for an interesting combination of continued low interest rates, a lower growth economy but higher inflation. We are looking at a macroeconomic environment which has changed significantly over the last six months and we are certainly taking that environment into account in terms of how we go to market.  Let me be clear, we have not yet seen evidence of any real spike in inflation in our loss trend data. Finally, we have been disciplined with regard to the left side of our balance sheet as we have with the right side. Bill Heyman and his folks have done a terrific job in thinking about risks and in making sure that our risks and return equation is disciplined and thoughtful. As a result so far we have been able to avoid all of the missteps that plague so many other financial service companies.  We have managed our business with long-term returns and profitability in mind and this philosophy has served us particularly well. So tying it all together we remain committed to our long-term financial objectives and I believe the franchise is well positioned to achieve them. History would suggest that our confidence is well placed. Since January of 2005 we have achieved an average return on equity of 15.3% after $1.9 billion in after tax catastrophe losses including the largest U.S. catastrophe on record as well as an increasingly competitive pricing environment in much of our business dating back to 2005.  Our underwriting results over time are a real indication of our underwriting experience, skill and discipline. So we look forward to our goal of mid teens ROE over time, it is based on what the businesses have achieved, how we underwrite and how we manage our capital.  With that let me turn it over to Jay. \nJay Benet: Thanks Jay. Let me begin by going through some of the highlights during the quarter as shown on page 3 of the web cast. As Jay mentioned, second quarter 2008 operating income was $918 million or $1.50 per diluted share producing an operating return on equity of 14.3%. Our weighted average diluted share count declined to 611 million shares as we continued to generate capital in excess of our growth needs and used $750 million of that excess capital to repurchase 15.3 million of our common shares in the current quarter.  Despite dividends and share repurchases of $4.1 billion in the last twelve months, adjusted book value per share grew by 12% in the past year and 3% in the current quarter. Later Brian and Joe will discuss the drivers behind the slight decrease in net written premiums so let me end my comments on this page by noting how pleased we are that we received the ratings upgrade from Moody\u2019s this quarter.  Page 4 of the web cast shows the components of operating return on equity as we first displayed them at our May 2008 Investor Day conference. Fixed income net invested income less interest expense remained the major driver of year-to-date operating ROE. This passage of time component produced an 8.8% return in the current period, down slightly from the prior two years due to lower short-term interest rates.  A much smaller contributor to operating ROE both historically and year-to-date is non-fixed income investment income which produced a positive return of 0.3%, down as expected due to current market conditions.  Underwriting income continued to provide a very strong return of 5.8% year-to-date driven by healthy underlying underwriting margins along with net favorable prior year development and despite a very high weather related losses.  As the data on page 5 indicates both CATs and net favorable prior year reserve development played a meaningful role in our results. CAT losses which were concentrated in the business and personal insurance segments resulted from the unusually large number of severe weather events that occurred during the quarter including tornados, hail storms and floods in various regions of the United States. CAT losses net of reinsurance added 6.6 points to our GAAP combined ratio this quarter. Net favorable prior year reserve development resulting from better than expected loss experiences in each of our business segments reduced our second quarter GAAP combined ratio by 9.8 points. As this slide indicates our GAAP combined ratio when adjusted for CAT net favorable prior year reserve development and last year\u2019s timing impact for the change to the fixed value based agent compensation program increased by 2 points. This increase, which was less than the 2.4 increase in this year\u2019s first quarter, was generally consistent with our underlying expectations for pricing and loss cost trends and also included the impact of a small increase in the number of large property losses that Brian will discuss later.  Page 6 provides further information about our net favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter. Development was concentrated in our commercial businesses for accident years 2004-2007 primarily related to liability lines and was net of an $85 million increase in environmental reserves.  There are many factors that have contributed to our favorable reserve development in recent quarters. Some we can control and others we cannot. Within our control are processes that help to detect unfavorable trends that could lead to unfavorable development such as having the analytical tools, management information and culture to maintain strict underwriting discipline at all times while maintaining thoughtful and responsible reserve methodologies that constantly look back to underwriting and claims experience.  Also within our control are initiatives that can actually give rise to favorable reserve development such as the claims initiatives we introduced in recent years that reduced actual claim costs from claim costs assumed in reserving that had been based upon historical settlement values. These claim initiatives have included faster settlement of auto claims and the use of managed care techniques for Worker\u2019s comp claims and others.  Factors that are not within our control include improvements in the legal and judicial environment including torte reform. All of these factors have continued to play a role in the favorable development of our prior year reserves and in many cases translate into improved estimates and profitability in current year business.  Before turning the microphone over to Brian I did want to provide an update to certain information we last provided to you over a year ago at our May 2007 Investor Day Conference. Since that time we have been actively managing our CAT risks by reducing our hurricane exposure in coastal areas in the southeast and changing our reinsurance coverage to reduce hail risks and related capital charges particularly as they relate to northeast winds. Our focus has been on reducing exposure to highly severe, extremely low frequency events.  As can be seen on Page 7, our estimated probable maximum loss for a single hurricane at the 1 in 100 level net of reinsurance and after tax has been reduced to $1.4 billion or 5% of common equity. A single hurricane at the 1 in 250 level also net of reinsurance and after tax has been reduced to $2.2 billion or 9% of common equity. I should point out that these estimates correlate to extremely large industry events much larger than say a Katrina.  Our P&L estimates are based upon assumptions outlined on Page 2 of the Appendix to this web cast presentation and factor in the July 1, 2008 CAT reinsurance renewals that are incorporated into the chart provided on Pages 20 and 21 in the Appendix. The only significant change to our CAT reinsurance program and this year\u2019s July 1 renewal was the addition of another $250 million of northeast only coverage which brought our northeast CAT treaty up to $500 million and when combined with our $500 million CAT bound brought our total northeast coverage up to $1 billion, all excess of $2.25 billion.  The cost of our national CAT treaty was $77 million for the coverage period July 1, 2008 through July 30, 2009, down from $100 million for the prior year period. I should also point out this information regarding P&L is based upon output from analytical modeling related to probability and potential losses which are inherently unpredictable and that actual CAT losses could be materially greater than indicated. I urge you to read Page 23 of the Appendix of this web cast and with that let me turn things over to Brian. \nBrian MacLean:  Thanks Jay. I\u2019ll begin by going over the production statistics for our commercial businesses and as you can see the results continue to be strong. Current market dynamics are obviously impacting our results but as our numbers indicate in the aggregate we are managing these market dynamics quite well.  Looking at the details on Slide 8 you can see that retentions remain at high levels across all the domestic, U.S. commercial businesses. These overall high retention levels reflect our ability to withstand market place pressure and execute on our strategy to keep profitable business and not sacrifice underwriting results.  In the international operations retention was down due to the intentional non-renewal of certain property business in Canada and auto business in Ireland and competitive market conditions impacting our Lloyd\u2019s business. Our business in the UK continued to have strong retention numbers.  The renewal price change which reflects both rate and exposure changes remains generally consistent with recent quarters. RPC in the Select business which represents about \u00bc of the business insurance segment was still positive and consistent with the last two quarters. In the remaining domestic businesses the change in RPC was down modestly due primarily to declining exposure which reflects the broader economic environment. Underlying rate changes were consistent with last quarter.  The improvement in the international renewal price change was due to increased exposures primarily in Lloyd\u2019s. Again, our organization has done a great job of preserving our renewal book at appropriate price levels.  The new business dollars are shown on slide 9. In the aggregate they are essentially flat with the second quarter last year and last quarter. In the domestic businesses they were down slightly and in the international operations new business was up primarily due to Lloyd\u2019s. To get the real story you have to get beneath the written dollars and look at deal flow, quote ratios and hit ratios.  Overall flow of new business submissions was up in most all our businesses and in some businesses they were up dramatically. For example, in commercial accounts, our middle market franchise and construction which combined comprised about 25% of the premiums in the segment. Quotes year-to-date were up around 20% from 2007 and 50% from 2006. Our new product offerings, platform enhancements and strong position with agents and customers have continued to drive this heavy flow of opportunity.  We continue to feel good about the quality of the opportunities we are seeing. Accordingly we are quoting on much of this business and our quote ratio remains fairly consistent with historical trends. Unfortunately the pricing on new business continues to deteriorate and since we are being just as selective as we have always been our hit ratio, or the percentage of our quotes where we are winning, has been declining through 2007 and the first half of 2008. We believe that is evidence of our underwriting discipline.  We think the real story here is that we have built a franchise which is driving significantly more opportunities our way. In this more challenging pricing environment that has enabled us to maintain share where we seek to do so. More importantly it leaves us extremely well positioned for when the market conditions improve.  With respect to international the increase in new business over the prior-year quarter is driven by Lloyd\u2019s. As part of our strategy we have hired two underwriting teams, power and utilities and yachts that have generated over $50 million in the quarter. These are experienced teams that understand their markets.  Turning to the business segment financial results on Slide 10 you can see that net written premiums declined 4% quarter-over-quarter. The decline is due to the market pricing dynamics I just discussed and in these market conditions this feels like the right answer especially with retention levels remaining very strong.  On Slide 11 business insurance operating income was down 18% from the same quarter last year. The adjusted combined ratio on the page was 93.3 for the quarter, a two point deterioration from the second quarter last year. This decline reflects some compression of our core margin which is essentially in line with our expectation of benign loss trends and moderate price declines as well as a modest increase in the number of large property losses which I will discuss in a few minutes.  Our expense ratio after considering the timing impact of the agent compensation program is up about 9/10 of a point. 6/10 of this is the result of a reduction in national account fee income and the remainder is primarily from the decline in earned premiums.  So for the domestic U.S. business we feel great about how we are executing in some difficult market conditions. Business volumes and margins are down but modestly and given the market place we believe that is a very good result.  Turning to financial, professional and international insurance on Slide 12 the segment continued to produce positive results with operating income up 34% from the same quarter last year driven by the favorable prior year development. The adjusted combined ratio of 95.3 was also up 2 points in this segment from the second quarter of 2007 reflecting the same market conditions I just described in business insurance as well as the increase in large property losses.  It is probably worth noting right here that our increase in loss and LAE ratio in this segment is not the result of increased losses in our management liability business which includes our DNO portfolio or our surety business which includes our exposure to contractors in general and the central artery project in Boston in particular.  Financial, professional and international net written premiums of $985 million in the quarter was flat with the prior year. Bonded financial products premium quarter-over-quarter declined but was more than offset by net written premium growth in our international operations which benefited from the new business growth in the two units at Lloyd\u2019s also reflecting the favorable impact of exchange rates. Now I want to take a minute to talk about the property large loss dynamic that I mentioned is running through both commercial segments. This increase in loss activity is being driven primarily by a modest increase in the number of large property losses in excess of $5 million net of reinsurance. We obviously anticipate some losses of this size but in the first half of 2008 the actual number of losses was above our normal expectations.  So to really quantify this for you we are talking about seven losses in business insurance and five in financial, professional and international. More importantly we manage our limits tightly with a maximum net retention of $15 million in business insurance and the UK and $5 million in our Canadian and Lloyd\u2019s operations. So in the aggregate it is not a large financial exposure but it is affecting our combined ratio comparisons in 2008.  The biggest issue is do we see this as a trend and if so is it from our underwriting. I can tell you for all large losses we scrutinize this very closely. We have examined all our large property losses. We have challenged ourselves and looked at all the data. The events run the gamut from the fire at Universal Studios to a large sugar plant explosion to a fire at a hotel under construction in Boston. We have not seen anything we can yet call a trend other than the obvious that many commercial losses are fire related.  So our assessment is this is not a result of our underwriting or pricing decisions but is an aberration. We are aware that industry-wide losses are also up and so we know that the issue is not unique to our results. In summary, although it is certainly worth noting for the quarter and year-to-date results we don\u2019t see this as a trend but we are watching it very closely.  Stepping back to the larger picture overall our results in this quarter considering the softer insurance market place and the general economic conditions are very solid. We experienced strong levels of retention, modest price declines on our retained book, a significant flow of new submissions and our core margins are performing as expected.  With that let me turn it over to Joseph Lacher for the personal insurance results. \nJoseph Lacher:  Thanks Brian. Personal insurance results start on Page 13. Not surprisingly weather is a significant part of this segment\u2019s results for the quarter. Even against that backdrop, personal insurance produced strong results so the combined ratio of 97.3% and $122 million in operating earnings.  We have strong production results with increased new business and retention renewal pricing in year-over-year policy in force growth consistent with recent quarters. When comparing the quarter\u2019s profitability to the second quarter of 2007 earnings were down primarily driven by significant adverse CAT and non-CAT weather related losses, somewhat less favorable prior year reserve development and lower net investment income.  Excluding these items and the impact and the timing of the 2007 agent compensation program change the underlying combined ratio was in line with the prior year quarter. Looking specifically at our property results on Page 14 and in the statistical supplement, we can see the impact of adverse weather on the quarter. It is not news to any of you that the industry experience for the second quarter is projected to be one of the worst second quarters in a long time.  While our property results were impacted by nearly 19 points in catastrophes, we still reported an underwriting profit with a 96.5% combined ratio. At the same time we continued to grow our business. Policies in force increased 3%; retention remained stable at 86% with a renewal price change of +6%.  We remain pleased with the continuing growth of the Quantum Home product and its ability to increase new business volume despite competitive market conditions. Quantum Home policies now represent a little over 10% of our policies in force.  Shifting to auto, our combined ratio for the quarter was 97.9%. Catastrophes negatively impacted that combined by 1.5 points in the quarter. We are pleased with our production results in the current market conditions. New business volume was up over 12% versus the prior year quarter and is at the highest levels we have experienced since the first half of 2006 and the roll out of Quantum Auto.  Policies in force grew 3% over the prior year quarter and at the same time our renewal price change was at +2% with retentions consistent with prior quarters. We continue to make investments in our business, infrastructure and distribution capabilities to fuel our long-term profitable growth. These investments continue to impact our results.  Our ongoing agency appointment strategy is one example. As an anecdotal illustration one of our regions reported in their last internal operating review that over 20% of their new business volume this year came from agents appointed within the last 18 months. They continue to deploy a systematic, segmented distribution and management process that is yielding growth opportunities without the need to be imprudently competitive on pricing.  Turning to page 15 I would like to touch on loss inflation in the auto line. Excluding the anticipated impacts from the broader risk profile of Quantum, we saw loss inflation in the quarter to be essentially flat. Frequency trends were down just slightly. We experienced total severity trends up just slightly. Similar to recent quarters we saw damage related severity increasing in the low single-digits and bodily injury severity slightly decreasing.  We believe this is a big deal. These numbers are not loose impressions but rather are based on actual experience. As we have previously discussed our bodily injury results appear out of pattern and better than what a number of our competitors have reported. We believe this is a direct result of our claim initiatives which leverage the strength and breadth of our multi-line claim organization. This continues to be a leveragable competitive advantage for us.  While the market place remains competitive we are seeing increasing signs of firming particularly in the auto line. We are continuing to monitor these, monitor loss trends and profitability and market place conditions as well as the change in economic climate. We adjust our tactics going forward. We remain pleased with the businesses\u2019 underlying performance and look forward to building on that success.  With that I will turn it back over to Jay. \nJay Benet:  Thanks Joe. Net investment income for the quarter is shown on Page 16 with $624 million after tax or $134 million lower than the prior year quarter. Fixed income related NII was down only $7 million from the prior year quarter and was impacted by the lower shorter term interest rates. The major variance between the two periods occurred due to non-fixed income returns which remain positive well below the prior year period level as we had expected.  This level of non-fixed income related NII resulted from lower real estate and private equity partnership gains due to low transaction volume given current market conditions. Overall our after-tax yield was 3.4% for the quarter.  Turning to Page 17, our investment portfolio and our balance sheet continue to be in terrific shape as we continue to avoid the issues that others have had to deal with. We ended the quarter with almost $26 billion of common equity X FAS115 and book value per share X FAS115 of $43.45, up 3% in the current quarter and up 12% from a year ago. All this after $3.4 billion of share repurchases and $730 million of common stock dividends during the past twelve months.  Our capital remains at or above all of our target levels and we continue to generate significant amounts of excess capital and liquidity. Our debt to total cap ratio was 19.7% at the end of the quarter compared to our 20% target and holding company liquidity was $2.2 billion or twice our target of one year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends.  Page 18 provides updated information concerning our guidance for full-year 2008. We continue to expect fully diluted operating income per share of $5.55 to $5.85 which translates into an operating return on equity of approximately 13-14%. Our guidance incorporates our results for the first half of the year and assumes the continuation of lower short-term interest rates and the more challenging environment we experienced in the first half for non-fixed income investment returns.  Our guidance now assumes full-year CAT losses of $785 million pre-tax or $510 million after tax or $0.84 per share after tax which has been adjusted for actual CAT losses in the first half of the year. No further prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable. No significant change in average invested assets X FAS115 and after approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases for the full year and our revised weighted average share count of approximately 610 million shares after share repurchases and employee equity rewards.  Before we take questions I\u2019d like to turn it back to Brian who has a clarification. \nBrian MacLean:  One quick correction. When I was talking about the business insurance new business glove what I should have said was submissions from agents of deals was up 20% from 2007 and 50% from 2006 in our middle market and construction businesses. I think I incorrectly used the word quotes there.  So our quote activity is obviously up but not that dramatically. \nJay Benet:  With that why don\u2019t we open it up for questions? \nOperator: (Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Jay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers. \nJay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers: I was hoping you could touch on a couple of points. First on the auto frequency trend can you outline to what extent you think that is driven by higher gas prices and consumers driving less and the sustainability there? Also with the combined ratio in auto in the high 90\u2019s do you feel you need to be taking more rate? The second issue I wanted to touch on is I don\u2019t know if you can quantify the fully impact of the non-CAT weather in the large property losses in the quarter and finally Jay if you could touch on your appetite for M&A at this point? \nJoseph Lacher:  On the auto frequency piece Jay we have seen all the reports on fewer miles driven per vehicle and lots of speculation on gas prices. My answer is going to be equal speculation at this point unencumbered by fact. It looks like it to us. There is no real way to tell. That seems to be the most logical conclusion. We are not making the assumption it is sustainable and will continue to drop over the long-term. Given where we are right now that is not the basic assumption we are making going forward. We are obviously constantly watching it and we\u2019ll see what happens but we are not assuming sustainability in terms of how we are going to navigate the business.  Relative to the pricing dynamic, we shoot for a mid-teens ROE. I\u2019m not going to comment on specific pricing strategies of how we are working through it. We are obviously in the upper end of a tolerable combined ratio and we are obviously seeing the market place conditions we talked about and we\u2019ll factor all of that into our pricing though process. \nJay Fishman:  The one observation I can give Jay is we were updating the grid that we shared with you previously at Investor Day for targeted product returns. The combined ratio in auto that we generated in the quarter and I think in the six months, let\u2019s check that but I believe it is true, the returns had an X for the auto business it would still be in that box that meets our targeted threshold of returns. So at these levels even given this interest rate environment because we are factoring that into our analysis the auto business continues to produce our targeted return in that 13-18% range we disclosed previously. \nJoseph Lacher:  At a 97.9 I pointed out we have got a point and a half impact on catastrophes running through that number. You don\u2019t typically see that running through auto numbers and you can track our CAT on auto back for awhile. That is somewhat atypical. We are okay with where it is. \nJay Fishman:  The response to the merger and acquisition question is the same as it would have been if you were asking three months ago. There is nothing in particular that has changed. We think we have the tools and the requisite skills to grow our business organically and that is clearly our focus. Any transaction we would even consider we would do so only in the mindset that we would be convinced conclusively it would add to shareholder value and that kind of analysis would always incorporate the risk associated with any transaction and I have articulated before balance sheet risks and capital risks and people risks and systems risks and it is high. We have done enough of them to know how high those risks are.  The answer with respect to the M&A environment is it is no different than it would have been in the first quarter. \nJoseph Lacher:  On the property loss thing Jay we are not disclosing a discrete number but I gave you a lot of information there. If you want to do the arithmetic the first six months and say about a dozen losses and I gave you the limits. They weren\u2019t all limit losses but you can come up with a number. I think the conclusion there is that it is causing a little blip in the first two quarters. The bigger issue as I mentioned in my comments is what does it mean for going forward and we are looking at that just like everybody else in the industry. \nJay Fishman:  I will make an observation. Brian did actually articulate three of the losses. Two of the other ones were aircraft actually. So it is all over the lot. It is just not specific.  Let me correct that response, I\u2019m sorry. The airline events that I was just making reference to actually fall below the threshold that Brian identified as large property losses. I misspoke and I apologize. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of William Wilt \u2013 Morgan Stanley. \nWilliam Wilt \u2013 Morgan Stanley:  First a general question. Jay I heard you remarks at the outset on inflation. You seemed to recap that it is on the radar screen but not yet showing up on the loss cause trends you are analyzing. At least not in an outsized way. I guess one confirming that is the right characterization. Two, what types of inflation are highest on your radar screen? \nJay Fishman:  Your characterization is actually right on. I think all of us are aware of the inflation risks predominately from what we have been reading in the financial press, watching oil now albeit at $126 per barrel rather than $140. The sort of attention that has been given to it. What I think that people would anecdotally think is perhaps we have seen it in construction materials already. We have certainly read about increases of prices in cement and increasing prices in building materials generally. Interestingly enough it hasn\u2019t yet evidenced itself in any substantive, serious way in our loss trend data. Notwithstanding under the anecdotal observations. But given the fact we incorporate estimated inflation as we price our product and reserve our product it would be foolish of us not to have it higher on the radar screen than perhaps it might have been six months ago. We have, the industry has benefited from a long standing period of benign inflation and I think that has to some extent offset some of the pricing pressure that has been around for a couple of years. If in fact that inflation dynamic changes it is obviously something we need to begin to think about in the context of our pricing strategies. That is I think why we identified it as an item of concern and it belongs on the radar screen for any responsible management team. \nBrian MacLean:  When you look at the hierarchy of concern the other one that would be high on the list is medical inflation flow through. Obviously our Workers Comp and many of our liability claims so we watch medical inflation very closely. \nWilliam Wilt \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Thank you for that. The same characterization holds true there? It is on the radar screen but no apparent change? \nBrian MacLean:  Correct. We are always seeing minor ups and downs but nothing systemic. \nJay Fishman:  I want to comment though because it is obviously information that is available on the Workers Compensation\u2026\nBrian MacLean:  For example comp was aligned where we actually had a little bit of unfavorable development in the quarter. That was due to seeing both pharmaceutical costs and long term care costs inflated higher than what we thought. It actually helps to break the comp disclosure down by year, which I don\u2019t think we do publicly. The more recent accident years, I think 2005, 2006 and 2007 I think were still developing favorably and it would be 2004 and prior that were net negative. That was an example of seeing some relatively minor but of course you know inflationary\u2026\nJay Fishman :  Jay spoke about it earlier. What you are hearing on this call is actually an example of the feedback that exists between the claims department, loss analysis right back in the underwriting. It is incorporating what we are seeing on the front line back on the claims side back into our underwriting analysis. You hope it keeps us a step ahead of the game. \nWilliam Wilt \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Jay you have talked quite a bit before about the evolution of the pricing cycle and suggested that folks should keep a close eye on retention ratios and the new business penalty. I guess I\u2019m looking for an update to that discussion. Retention ratios hanging in there. Has the new business penalty shrunk? Is that part of the reason perhaps that retention ratios are remaining stable? \nJay Fishman:  No, I don\u2019t think so. That is the short answer. First of all I characterize the retention ratios as actually worth hanging in there. I think actually [inaudible] in a sense there. They are different. This is a different cycle certainly than anybody sitting around this table has ever experienced before. This long into a pricing deterioration, albeit a modest one where retentions have stayed at the levels they are and continue to look just very, very solid. If anything in the second quarter and this is more anecdotal than it is factual because it is hard to track it quite that currently, our sense was that the market for new business actually became somewhat more heated and the little bit of data I can offer that is interesting, Brian ran through the points so quickly I think it gets lost. A number of actual field quote submissions that we are seeing is up in many of our businesses and they are up dramatically. We want to talk about competitive advantages. If you never get a deal on a house if you never bid on it.  As Brian talked about a 50% increase in field quote submissions and the sum of middle market construction in the last three years, two years, really it is quite amazing. The quote ratio, the number of times we quote, has largely stayed flat but the hit ratio is actually down. The number of times we are succeeding is actually down and we take that as kind of a leading indicator on the nature of the competitive market for new business. Based upon that data we would conclude that the second quarter was somewhat more heated for new business. Not less.  I do understand you analysts say well how do you figure retentions are staying as high as they are and I guess the same question that has been out there for awhile. This is an interesting market. It is a new business market that has a certain aggressiveness to it and a retention market that has a surprising amount of stability to it. Beyond that I\u2026\nNot Identified:  The other point I\u2019d make and maybe a little bit given some credit here, I don\u2019t think there are a lot of competitors that talk about deal flow numbers so it is not something you can see easily. Given\u2026I doubt that many of them would be talking about a lot more deal flow right now. I think part of it honestly does speak to our position in the market place in both our ability to retain our accounts and our ability to attract significantly more deal flow in an economic environment where I don\u2019t think there is a lot more deal flow out there in the aggregate. This speaks somewhat to our franchise and what we have been doing. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup. \nJoshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup:  My first question regards the environmental reserve addition. What are you seeing in environmental that led you to this modest reserve addition overall? \nJay Benet:  There is not a lot going on. What we saw in the data we had as it relates to pending policy holders so it is not driven by new stuff coming in. We did see some upward development in the expense costs and settlement values so we reflected that in this quarter. \nJoshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup: Refresh us. Have there been any trends there or is this a one-off in terms of where we have seen the previous quarters? \nJay Benet:  I wouldn\u2019t say there has been any trend. Each year and each quarter we go through and evaluate what has taken place. Sometimes it takes a little longer for information to develop for us to act on it. We do, as you said, recognize the fairly modest increase to the reserves and it is just indicative of us always staying on top of what is taking place in our reserves and making sure our balance sheet is as current as can be. \nJoshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup: You mentioned 2004-2007 years particularly in liability have been showing some favorable development. Particularly that 2007 year, what kind of data are you getting and is that the minority of the impact or are you seeing that 2007 is really turning into a year where you might see some profit? \nJay Benet:  That is a great question. When we talk about where the reserve development is taking place and obviously it gets highlighted in particular years. But it also goes back to something that is inherent in the reserving process. That being that when you start analyzing 2004, 2004 provides you information as to not just 2004 but the starting points then for 2005, 2006 and 2007. So each one of the analogies kind of rolls into the next. When we talk about adjusting 2007 it is not an adjustment based on just current long-tail information coming in at a rate that is lower than what we expected. That is not the primary driver. The more current of the years is driven more by the roll over effect of what is taking place from the prior years. \nJoshua Shanker \u2013 Citigroup: Finally, and I\u2019m being as nonspecific as possible and really intend to be, but in the events you were to make an acquisition what sort of financial metrics in terms of pay back or in terms of what it has to be in terms of being accretive to Travelers, what do you have to see early on and what do you have to see over a 3-5 year period to justify it in your mind? \nJay Fishman:  I\u2019m not sure I really know how to kind of answer that question other than to say which is the same thing I have been saying\u2026we would have to be convinced that a transaction would add to shareholder value. I think the way you analyze that is based upon the specific circumstances of the time. Every transaction I have ever been involved in has always stood on its own analytically. Every one added something different from another. So the way in which you approach thinking about what it did for your franchise the transaction simply adds volume, you bring in geographically and you kind of analyze one way. A transaction that helps you get through a strategic imitative that might be important you might have a longer view of. So I don\u2019t know really how to answer it other than to say anything we ever looked at would have to pass a high pressure test of creating shareholder value. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan. \nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: I guess my question is just the economy and its potential impact on exposures and the brokers have opined that I think of the smaller end of the market that is becoming an issue in their eyes. It doesn\u2019t look based on the premium trends that necessarily is indicative of what might be happening broadly speaking. I was wondering if you could just give some insights there? \nJay Fishman:  First let\u2019s make sure we are talking about the same thing. When we talk about exposure we think about it as units of insurance. So if you are writing an account and they have one truck and they are growing their business and they add a second truck and they need more insurance that to us is a change in exposure. So if that is the concept\u2026\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: I guess it would be more broad than that. I guess it would be since exposure could be for Work Comp, payrolls, it could be autos\u2026it could be that plus maybe discretionary decisions about how much coverage. \nNot Identified:  A lot of our products are rated on receipts, etc. \nJay Fishman:  We are an industry that likes economic growth. The more economic growth there is the more stuff there is to insure. We are all for making new plants and hiring more people and adding to payrolls and when payrolls shrink and plants get closed and shuttered our economic engine turns the other way. In its simplest form and I can tell you what we have seen so far is we have exposure while positive in the quarter was nonetheless lower than what it had been. That is an early indicator of some slow down and that is what it is. I don\u2019t know for sure. It is too early to tell. But I would say again that exposure in the aggregate is positive in the quarter. It didn\u2019t shrink but it is down from where it was. We\u2019re going to watch that very carefully.  Again I\u2019m not sure we can do much about it. We will write more Worker\u2019s Comp business when payrolls go up. We\u2019ll write more property insurance. As companies expand we\u2019ll do better and as company\u2019s contract we\u2019ll do worse. \nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: There has been a lot of M&A, and this isn\u2019t your outfit, there has been a lot of M&A that has happened, particularly smaller, regional companies. I guess does that help or hurt your strategy? I guess what I\u2019m really getting at is I view one of your advantages as being kind of your pockets and your resources and your technology which creates an advantage. As some of these companies perhaps become part of bigger organizations do you worry about that eroding or given that some of these businesses are net new they still don\u2019t have the kind of scale you have? \nJay Fishman:  I\u2019d say first that give the stability of this organization, given its feel for stability we hope that we are the beneficiaries any time there is any dislocation in the market place. Any time there is a transaction where one company is combining with another any agents office there is always dislocation. Always. I think given our stability and the clarity of our underwriting profile in the near term we end up as a beneficiary of those things and so that is more of an aspirational statement but a belief more than I can show you and prove to you.  In the long-term there isn\u2019t anything that has happened in the last year or two years that cause us to feel at any competitive disadvantage or the advantages of the company have in any way been compromised or marginalized. I just don\u2019t believe that. The transactions have been largely related to relatively small companies with either relatively small geographic footprints or very narrow underwriting profiles. I just don\u2019t think it makes much of a difference.  I said before I didn\u2019t think that the two mutual transactions would particularly change the competitive market place much at all. I still believe that and I still think we are just very well positioned in the competitive arena. We are unusual in that we are a very big company but with a focus on small and middle market commercial business.  It is really a function of the history of the organization and how it came together. It has come together with a bunch of individual companies that all had that end of the market to focus. We love it.  One of the real advantages is the ability to bring expertise, platforms and Travelers Express has been nothing short of a home run. It really has been remarkable. And it takes real assets to be able to do it. It takes real wherewithal. If you are a little company with a little footprint you haven\u2019t got that much wherewithal to create a Travelers Express. So the real scale opportunities that come to us I think do because we are as solid as we are and yet we market to an end of the market that most competitors don\u2019t have that scale. It is an interesting place to be. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Alain Karaoglan \u2013 Banc of America Securities.   \nAlain Karaoglan \u2013 Banc of America Securities: I have a couple of questions Jay. If I look at the current accident tier combined ratio it is around 92.5 and at 2.5 points of normalized catastrophes you\u2019d be at around a 95 give or take a few which would suggest the return on equity based on slide 4 of around 12%. Is it time to focus\u2026when would it be time to focus more intently on the expense ratio given that the pricing environment is continuing to be challenging, the opportunities and doing the best to get new business but top line isn\u2019t likely to grow significantly. \nJay Fishman:  I think we focus on expenses all the time. It is always to focus on expenses. There is never a time not to. We don\u2019t focus candidly on the expense ratio as many analysts tend to look at. The reason is when you look at the success of this organization much of it has happened because of investments which drove an increase in the expense ratio and ultimately provided a more than offsetting benefit, significantly more than offsetting benefit, of a loss ratio. I would use all the claim work that Joe has talked about so effectively over the last couple of years. That takes real people and real systems and real spending to have happen. I would tell you that what we do every day is we think about the long-term returns that are available to us in the business and we make the investments we are going to make that we are convinced will add to that value equation and allow us to continue to hit the mid-teens ROE over time. That is the way we think about the business.  If an investment won\u2019t help us meet that goal we are not going to make it regardless of the environment we are in. If it does make it we are going to try like heck to make that investment regardless of the environment. There are going to be times where and we are not yet there, I think that is an important point, we are not yet at the point where it would be appropriate to start chipping away at the investment strategy of the organization. It has been very successful. It has got a great governance and diligence process around it and we are going to continue it. If in fact the market continues to deteriorate and two years from now we are having this conversation I think the bar gets raised and we look at it differently.  I would tell you that when you look at Travelers it is not at all like in the old days in the sense that it is not about cell phones anymore. It is not about clients in the office. We are an unbelievably expense conscious, expense focused organization and by that I mean no one wastes any money here. No one wastes money.  Ultimately what you are really talking about is the level of investment we made to build our business for the future and that gets rigorous analysis for the long-term. \nAlain Karaoglan \u2013 Banc of America Securities: A follow-up to that, on the personal auto business for Joe the command ratio was 98.6 and 97.9 if you take away the CAT. Were reserve releases similar to what you had in the personal lines? That would suggest a combined ratio closer to 98.5. Any way to quantify what is the investment you are making? Why are you still comfortable that you are okay and we shouldn\u2019t worry more about it going forward? \nJoseph Lacher:  The reserve releases, we don\u2019t disclose those by line, were generally consistent but lower in the quarter than they had been for auto. But they have also been somewhat consistently running for some period of time inside of that line. When we look at the combined ratios and we look at the mid-teens ROE and the range we have put on them before we see the line running inside of that range. Admittedly at the less profitable end of that range but inside the range. \nJay Fishman:  It is not hard in our business when you have the analytics to sit down and know exactly what combined ratio will translate to what return. It is not anecdotal. Joe has charts and the charts he has show here is the combined ratio. Here is the achievable return in that product. So we know it and we are watching it very, very carefully. There will come a time when you turn around and you go you know if you run the business for the long-term and we\u2019re going to make those hurdles and something has to change and we\u2019re going to take that into account as we think about our own pricing strategy.  So I think Joe said it right. I don\u2019t know that we are at the low end of the range of acceptable margin and acceptable return but we are certainly at the lower end but still well within that range that lets us meet those thresholds. If that changes we\u2019ll change our pricing strategy. \nJoseph Lacher:  What we experienced in the quarter was flat loss trend and a 2% positive RPC which isn\u2019t total gloom and doom. \nAlain Karaoglan \u2013 Banc of America Securities: I promise that is the last question. Jay in terms of the question on M&A transactions you mentioned you will judge them all in terms of creating shareholder value. I assume that relates to your mid-teens return on equity on average over time that any transaction you would like it to achieve\u2026that is how you would measure creating shareholder value from a financial point of view. \nJay Fishman:  I think that is right. I think you have got it exactly right. If ultimately we can achieve mid-teens and we end up taking on a transaction and we end up going down to single digits we haven\u2019t achieved much have we? I do think you have to look at these things in the long-term and that goes again to what the capital demands of whatever you buy. It is a complex issue but I think you expressed it exactly right. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse. \nVinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse:  On the Worker\u2019s Compensation business we saw some small areas of development in the 2004 and prior years. Does that change your mind about your decision to increase your Worker\u2019s Compensation business in small accounts? \nJay Benet:  No. We have talked a little bit about this in the past. We are a company that from a guaranteed cost perspective is relatively underrated in Worker\u2019s Comp but from an overall expertise in corporate capabilities and I\u2019m speaking to our larger account comp servicing carrier capabilities we are a very experienced and knowledgeable comp company. We are pretty confident if not the best one of the absolute best claim engines in control and comp losses. We think we know the line very well. We have historically had a very cautious; some might say overly cautious view of guaranteed cost comp. We have been over the last couple of years very selectively moving forward and trying to look at areas both by account size, and so we have done more in the small account area and also by geography.  This isn\u2019t close to a one size fits all but we are taking a very selective look at comp and we continue to think there is opportunities. We went through a bunch of this at Investor Day. We talked about some of our claim capabilities there. I think that is worth referring back to. We still feel good about the line and the 2004 and prior stuff hasn\u2019t really changed our view. \nVinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse: The second question is on personal auto. Joe mentioned that your [inaudible] claims are increasing less or maybe they are decreasing versus the prior years. Could you help us understand what specifically you are doing versus the other personal auto insurance that keeps your BI claims lower? \nJoseph Lacher:  I did say that our BI severity was decreasing, not increasing, which at least when we heard other folks talking about the last couple of quarters has been consistent with what other companies are seeing. I\u2019ll point you back a little bit to what we did in our recent Investor Day presentation because you can get a fair amount of slides and description longer than I can give you at the tail end of this call. We are taking advantage of the full breadth of our claims capability. Some of the managed care capabilities we have in our Workers Comp claim department to use nurses to triage medical claims from a BI perspective.  We are using our medical bill re-pricing capability for Workers Comp in the breadth of our networks to run medical bills through from an auto perspective. Those are capabilities that other players wouldn\u2019t have without the volume of medical losses that we have running through the entire organization. \nJay Fishman:  One of the things, it is no secret but it is not necessarily visible from our financials, we are a very, very large and very successful fee for service Workers Compensation Claims handler for large international accounts. We don\u2019t write the guarantee costs, the first dollar insurance you think of, but we handle substantial amounts of claims for large companies being paid a fee for managing those claims on their behalf. There is a significant developed over literally decades of Workers Comp claim handling engine that exists in this organization with real first rate medical plan expertise. Handling medical losses that occur on the job site. That expertise is stretchable. It can be stretched from that Worker\u2019s Comp platform over into the auto bodily injury work and if you don\u2019t have that Worker\u2019s Comp engine behind you then you don\u2019t have the ability to do that.  That is a perfect example of where the size of the organization benefits us really at the point of claim. There is a real difference, a competitive difference. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital. \nIan Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital: I want to go back to the M&A topic and rather than dance around it I thought I\u2019d try to ask a little bit more directly. Knowing your ability to comment may be limited but obviously there has been a lot of very public media reports about RBS and who is interested in that property. I guess what is surprising to me and the part I hope you can talk about is I can understand why you don\u2019t want to take a look at any big property on the market but when we see all these media reports that everyone else is dropping out and you are one of the final three left it implies you are relatively serious about it.  I guess what is confusing and what I hope you can address is from your past comments about M&A you have said that international is not a priority and I can\u2019t recall any time in the past you talking about being interested in getting into direct distribution. So it just seems that I can understand you wanting to look at deals that fit strategically. I guess I don\u2019t understand why more international and direct distribution whether it be RBS or some other company fit strategically with Travelers. \nJay Fishman:  Ian it is a very thoughtful question. Let me go back I think to 2005 when it was reported on page A1 of the Wall Street Journal that we were in deep talks with Zurich Financial Services and sources close to the talks were reporting that the transaction was imminent. The only thing I can comment is we are not responsible for media reports. We are responsible for what we say and ultimately the reason we came out with our commentary on the Zurich transaction was that it was being viewed by everyone as though we had said something. It was being viewed as fact. In fact it was proving to be not in the interest of our shareholders not to say something. I felt responsible to do so.  I don\u2019t feel that sense of responsibility now. I think it is very counterproductive to building shareholder value to comment every time someone suggests that we are looking at something. We are going to look at some things. We\u2019re not going to look at others. As I said before I think thoughtful management always stays tuned to what is happening in the market place to try and stay knowledgeable about things. But I think you have to rest back on my earlier comments which is notwithstanding the history of the company and the fact that it was built by acquisition we are in a very different place now. We are in a very, very different strategically competitive place and the only time we would look at something seriously would be if we were absolutely convinced it would add to shareholder value.  So if you are questioning that something wouldn\u2019t create shareholder value I think you can make the assumption we have had ourselves the same question. I\u2019d like to just leave it at that. I don\u2019t think I have anything more to say about any specific company or rumor. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch. \nJay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch: Jay your stock has been hovering around or even slightly below your book value per share. I guess theoretically what the market is saying is either they don\u2019t believe your book value per share which frankly given the reserves that you have seen and given the cleanliness of your asset portfolio doesn\u2019t seem to be a big concern or the second issue is your ROE is relatively quickly going down to your cost of equity capital, 9-10%. I guess I wanted to focus on that. What kind of environment would you have to see for your ROE to go from where they are now down to that level and what do you think the chances of that sort of environment are of emerging in the next 2 years? \nJay Fishman:  There is actually a slide in Jay Benet\u2019s presentation that actually answers that question. If you take a look on page 4 so far for this year we have earned a 9.1% return on equity from our investment portfolio in an environment of short rates. We can circle the short rates on that slide because they are actually half of what they were a year ago. 1.7 short rates versus 3.8 a year ago. We\u2019re talking about a 200 basis point drop in short rates in that period of time.  So we had a 9.1% return on equity just from the investment portfolio which means that the answer to the question is 100% combined ratio would have produced a 9.1% return on equity in this quarter and you see the numbers. How far are we away from 100% combined ratio? If rates continue to go down 3-5% we will eventually get there but we are a long way from 100 now.  That is why four is there, to show there is a sustainable level of return on equity in our business just embedded in the left side of the balance sheet and it is pretty powerful. I think that people tend to forget that and so that\u2019s why we present it that way. \nOperator:  The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS. \nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS:  You commented that pricing continues to be pretty competitive here. I was wondering if you could get a bit more granular and say what lines of business right now are you worried about or actively pulling away from versus what lines of business you think are attractive. Then can you provide some comments on what is happening in terms and conditions? \nBrian MacLean:  Consistent with what we have said in the past and I think what a lot of other folks say from account size perspective maybe most importantly the larger the account the more pressure, not to say there isn\u2019t pricing pressure everywhere. But clearly smaller accounts a lot less than larger accounts. You can see that a little bit with the fact that in small commercial we are still seeing total price change a little positive and underneath that total rate change would be slightly negative but very consistent. From a line of business perspective I would say large property stuff is under pressure and something we are looking at although the large loss dynamic I talked about especially being industry wide is beginning to have a lot of folks rethink that. So that might be one that we see some signs of actually the softening mitigating a little bit.  Nothing dramatic other than that within the lines. It is much more of account size. \nJay Fishman:  The other thing I was thinking about with some extent to size is if we had to pick one and we are obviously very large but the excess casualty business, the umbrella business, is one that has been subject to not an insignificant amount of price deterioration. \nBrian MacLean:  Even in that business you use the words pulling away from. We are not pulling away from that market but it is one where more accounts than not we see some pressure there. \nJay Fishman:  It really comes back to looking at the retention rates. We are not in effect pulling back from anything in our business. It would show up in the retentions if we were in a serious way. I think the relevant question is in the new business environment what is going on and you can look at the new business numbers and get a pretty good feel for it I think of what it is and how we are reacting to it. \nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: Are trends and conditions loosening at all? \nBrian MacLean:  Not dramatically. There is always some movement as markets move. On our book I would say not dramatically and I would probably have the same comment. The bigger the account the more pressure. \nJay Fishman:  If you think about it though, as we describe it, there is only a few businesses we are in where terms and conditions play. Small commercial is one. You really wouldn\u2019t talk about as the question is being asked in terms of conditions. You would think about it actual property. You would think about it in some of those lines; the individually negotiated if you like accounts. The smaller you get the less it becomes a substantive discussion. Is that fair? \nBrian MacLean:  [Products]. \nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: One last question for Joe. On the TD severity that you said was up modestly what would you attribute that to and would you expect the impact of raw material prices rising here may put some pressure on that severity here going forward? \nJoseph Lacher:  I think it is just generally what is in there already. It is the normal inflation in costs whether it is parts or labor rates or the like. You get some level of model symbol drip that is running through the physical damage severity which is the newer cars tend to have a higher value and there is a different repair cost there. It is that and we would expect that trend would generally continue. \nJay Fishman:  From a macroeconomic level there hasn\u2019t been any meaningful wage push inflation yet. That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be but you can actually look at Bureau of Labor Statistics data and you\u2019ll see there really is no significant wage push. That is one of the things we will keep watching as a leading indicator. \nOperator:  Your last question will come from the line of Josh Smith \u2013 TIAA Cref. \nJosh Smith \u2013 TIAA Cref:  On the investment portfolio no one would argue that you don\u2019t have one of the cleanest ones out there. I\u2019m just curious how you feel about the turmoil that is surrounding the GSE\u2019s and how that may affect your securitized leader at the more senior levels and secondarily with the two mono lines being put on watch for downgrade by Moody\u2019s\u2026I noticed that your AAA\u2019s have dropped sequentially during the quarter. I imagine that is because of downgrades of the mono lines in your Moody book. If you could talk about how if any deal went to AA how that would impact your credit quality? \nJay Fishman:  Josh we gave an analysis last quarter where we took the entire municipal fund portfolio and it is on the web, you can see it, where we actually gave the ratings, underlined the securities x the wrap and there is an analysis there and that hasn\u2019t changed any significant way. The portfolio would change from a rating perspective modestly if\u2026\nJosh Smith \u2013 TIAA Cref: I just noticed 10% went from AAA to AA and I thought it might have been due to mono lines losing the rating. \n[Bill]:  Let\u2019s go back and take the questions in order if we could. In a way we look at the GSE\u2019s not unlike municipals. The mortgage backed securities can be viewed as mortgage backs in which the residual is insured by the GSE. In terms of straight obligations of the GSE\u2019s our total for both is a mere $19 million which could be characterized as nothing more than a place holder. We look at them as financial institutions which have always been much more leveraged than the big money center banks and are treated accordingly.  With respect to our mortgage banks we look at them on the strength of the underlying mortgages and try not to attribute too much value to the guarantee of the U.S. government if there is one or the guarantee by the GSE of the pools. The underlying mortgages and underlying mortgage banks are in terms of age and seasoning we think pretty secure so we feel pretty good about them.  Skipping to the municipals I think one has to remember that the principle concern with the mono lines is less with their insuring municipal bonds which had very low full rates to begin with than with their insuring of structured products and with respect to those products when the insurance falls away there is much greater concern. With respect to municipal bonds again I think one has to remember that the rating scales are very different.  AA, maybe even less than AA municipal defaults with the same frequency as an AAA corporate. You have probably read the newspaper of Congressional testimony by municipal treasurers asking or demanding the rating scales be adjusted. We have always felt very secure about the credit of the municipal portfolio even in the absence of insurance and we have never owned a security where we felt we needed the insurance. Our view has been valuable if the County treasurer absconds with some money but in a period of financial stress the insurers are likely to have as much stress as the insurance and that is what we are seeing. So I hope that is responsive. \nJay Fishman:  I think that closes us up. Gabby? \nGabriella Nawi:  Thank you very much and any further questions see either myself or Mike Connolly in Investor Relations."}, {"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 1, "year": 2008, "date": "2008-04-24 17:15:11", "content": "Executives:  Jay S.

(Operator Instructions) At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Connelly, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Connelly, you may begin.\nMichael Connelly \u2013 Vice President, Investor Relations: Good morning and welcome to the Travelers discussion of the first quarter 2008 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and web cast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our web site at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.  Today with me is Jay Fishman, CEO, Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer, Brian McLean, Chief Operating Officer, Joe Lacher, Head of our Personal and Select businesses, as well as other members of senior management. They will discuss the financial results of our business in the current market environment. They will refer to the web cast presentation as they go through their prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions.  Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the web cast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserves and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectation due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.  Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention Travelers operating income which we use to measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplements, and other materials that are available in the Investor section of our website, www.travelers.com.  With that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Fishman: Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter we again produced strong financial results. Turning to Page 2, operating income per diluted share in the quarter was $1.61, up 4% from last year\u2019s first quarter. Operating return on equity was 15.6% and we posted an overall combined ratio of 87.6%. Book value per share, even after the $1 billion of share buy backs we completed in the first quarter, increased 3% from year end and 14% from one year ago. At the top line, net written premiums grew 2%, adjusting for the sales of Afianzadora Insurgentes and Mendota.  Given the insurance marketplace, we are very pleased with these results and we continue to find opportunities to grow our business thoughtfully and profitability. Jay is going to cover our investment income results in some detail in a few minutes. Before I turn it over to Jay, if you turn to Page 3, I would like to spend a minute or two sharing with you our thoughts on the factors that we believe will allow us to create substantial shareholder value. First, we have a series of important sustainable competitive advantages, starting with our product breadth. Our ability to underwrite successfully and respond to our agents\u2019 various product needs matters significantly to them in that it helps them be more productive in their own businesses. A by product of this breadth is the diversity it provides our company, we believe, better supporting more sustainable and consistent profits. Our scale is another key advantage, affording us both an opportunity to analyze data and I think in that regard predict a modeling that may be unique in our industry and to produce more predictable underwriting results over time. Next, we also have an extraordinarily important position with independent agents and our focus on helping them grow their businesses is reflected back to us in their commitment to us, as evidenced by the increasing flow of high-quality business opportunities they present to us and in their recognition of the value we create for their customers. We believe they advocate for us based on the merits.  An example of our ability to meet agents\u2019 needs is our strong focus in improving the ease of doing business with us and this is evidenced in winning platforms such as Travelers Express, Quantum Auto and Home, and our new industry edge middle-market products.  You\u2019ve all heard about Quantum Auto and Home before, but Travelers Express is a new business platform that is being rolled out for small commercial-flow business and is currently up and running in 37 states for multi-peril and 6 states for worker\u2019s comp. Submission rates are up 50% where it\u2019s been introduced and we are currently doing 40% of our new flow business through that platform. That percentage will grow as we continue to roll out. From an agent\u2019s perspective, it really is a big deal. Another example is the data that we make available to our field people and our distributors, analyzing the business that we do with them. We believe that ability, and the capacity that it gives to our agents to manage their business, is unmatched in our industry. At our Investor Day coming up on May 22nd we plan on giving you insight into how all this makes an important difference at the point of sale. We\u2019ll have much more to say about it then, but I encourage your attendance. It will be worth your time. These competitive advantages translate into an ability to generate top-tier results and substantial excess cash flow, as evidenced by nearly $9 billion of income over the past two years and with each year\u2019s operating return on equity approximating 18% and $5.1 billion of share repurchases over the past two years, including $1 billion in this most recent quarter. While it\u2019s obviously forward-looking, and it\u2019s not a prediction on our part, based on these results it is not at all difficult for us to envision substantial excess cash flow over the near- to intermediate-term. Combine that capital generation ability with our commitment to balancing book value growth with right-sizing our capital and you can understand the opportunity we see to create shareholder value. We are very well positioned. The strength of our balance sheet and liquidity enables us to continue to focus our attention on executing our strategy and positions us to consider investment portfolio opportunities that may come along as a result of the current investment environment. And with that let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks, Jay. Page 4 of the web cast summarizes our first quarter financial performance. Our net earned premiums increased by 1% quarter-over-quarter and operating income, which exceeded a billion dollars for the seventh quarter in a row, was down 6% in dollar terms and up 4% on a per share basis.  While I will speak to net investment income later in my commentary, I wanted to take a minute here to discuss net realized investment losses, which amount to $41 million after tax, or $61 million pre-tax, in the quarter. Included in net realized investment losses were impairments of $38 million pre-tax, the same modest amount that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2007. These first quarter impairments relate mostly to two small fixed-income investment portfolios that are, or were, managed by external managers. With these portfolios we cannot assert an intent and ability to hold the investments to maturity under the other-than-temporary impairment accounting rules. Therefore, when any bonds in these portfolios are in a loss position, even if the losses result solely from interest rate movement as opposed to credit deterioration, we are required to recognize these losses as impairments. Other items that contributed to first quarter net realized investment losses were the mark-to-markets on our Treasury-rate futures contracts, which we use to manage portfolio duration, and the mark-to-markets on certain common stock warrants that we hold. Importantly, our investment portfolio remains very healthy and very well-positioned.  Our Level 3 financial assets, as defined by FAS 157, were only $519 million, or less than 1% of total financial assets, and we ended the quarter with pre-tax net unrealized investment gains of $863 million. Our weighted average diluted share count of 628 million continued a significant decline due to share repurchase activity. We repurchased 20.8 million common shares in the quarter at a total cost of $1 billion and since the second quarter 2006 inception of our share repurchase program, we have bought back just under 100 million shares at a total cost of approximately $5.1 billion, representing 14.3% of the outstanding shares as of the beginning of that period. Turning to Page 5, our balance sheet continues to be in terrific shape. We ended the quarter with almost $26 billion of common equity ex-FAS 115 and book value per share ex-FAS 115 of $42.36, which was up 3% in the quarter and up 14% since a year ago. All this after $3.2 billion of share repurchases and $742 million of common stock dividends in the past 12 months. Our capital remains at or about target levels. Our AA free claims rating remains under review for possible upgrade from Moody\u2019s and we continue to generate significant amounts of excess capital and liquidity.  Our debt to total capital ratio decreased to 18.5% in the quarter compared to our 20% target, as we chose to pay down $400 million of debt that matured in March from operating cash flows. While we are maintaining 20% as our target for debt to total capital, it is important to note that we can self-fund the very modest level of debt that is scheduled to mature in the next few years. The rest of the information on the slide is pretty self-explanatory, but I did want to point out that holding company liquidity of $1.5 billion exceeded our target of one year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends by $400 million. As the data on Page 6 indicates, both CATs and net favorable prior year development played a meaningful role in this quarter\u2019s results. CATs were mostly concentrated in the business insurance segment. They related to February tornadoes and hail storms in the Midwest and Southeast, and while twice as high as in the prior year quarter, were not at all out-sized with respect to normal expectations that we have for winter storm losses. Net favorable prior year reserves development of $261 million after tax, which was also concentrated in our BI segment, primarily resulted from better than expected loss results in CMP, general liability, and property for recent accident years due to the improved legal and judicial environments, enhanced risk control, underwriting and claim processing initiatives, favorable trends in certain large claim exposures, and the recognition of higher than anticipated CD recoveries.  And in addition, BI also experienced favorable development of approximately $55 million related to hurricane Katrina, primarily due to a recent court decision clarifying policy coverage language. While this decision eliminated various uncertainties related to ultimate losses for Katrina, it did not resolve all uncertainties and we await further resolution of these matters in the future. As the slide indicates, our combined ratio, adjusted for CATs, net favorable prior year reserve development and last year\u2019s timing impact of the change to the fixed value-based agent compensation program increased by 2.4 points, which is a bit higher than the approximately 1 point that was factored into the initial guidance for the full year that we provided last quarter. So Brian is now going to give you some color on the combined ratio.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Building upon what Jay just outlined, let me take a few minutes to discuss our consolidated combined ratio performance. So turning to Slide 7, the net effect of pricing changes, loss trends, and shifts in the mix of business are driving the 1 point increase in the ratio that we expected. In addition, during the quarter there have been a few factors that further increased the combined ratio. Across several of our business insurance markets, we had an uncharacteristically high number of large property losses\u2014and just for your reference, the net retained amount per risk for commercial property exposures is generally limited to $15 million. We don\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything systemic here and we don\u2019t anticipate a recurrence but during this quarter property drove about \u00bd point of compression. In personal insurance non-capped weather losses added 7/10 of a point to the combined ratio, so all in, we realized a variance of 2.4 points in the quarter and we think that will work out to about 1.5 points for the full year, and that\u2019s \u00bd point more than we had originally projected.  So that\u2019s the combined ratio arithmetic. But what does it tell us about the overall market? Well, in the aggregate, our message is very consistent with prior quarters. The market is tightening, with commercial rates continuing to decline and new business pricing more competitive. But at least for our book, given the competitive advantages Jay outlined at the beginning, our market is tightening, but modestly. Looking at the details on Slide 8, you can see that retentions remain historically high across virtually all the businesses. The trend for the past five quarters has been consistently strong, particularly in commercial accounts, our core middle-market business. In our international operations, retentions were very solid at 81% but were down from previous quarters due to the deliberate underwriting actions to limit our Canadian earthquake exposure.  These high retention levels reflect our strategy to leverage our solid margins and keep the profitable business we have on our books. We believe these high retentions reflect the value of our franchise to our agents and our customers and they have not been attained at the expense of meaningful across-the-board rate accommodations. Pure rate change on the renewal book continued softening, but in the low single digits. In fact, the pure rate change improved slightly from recent quarters and was marginally better than our expectations. In the market the biggest declines in rate have been seen in the larger accounts and as you know, we are primarily a small- to mid-size account player, so our overall picture is somewhat better. On Slide 9, we show total renewal price change, which reflects both the rate and exposure change. RPC was generally consistent with recent quarters with the exception of our international business, which has been impacted by a reduction in exposure from some of our Lloyd\u2019s businesses. New business dollars are also shown on Slide 9 and here you can see evidence of some softening but overall solid new business performance. In the aggregate new business submission, that\u2019s our deal flow, was up in most of our businesses and in some businesses up dramatically. This is a testament to the strength of our new product offerings and the leading position with our agents, two or our major competitive advantages. The number of accounts we actually wrote as a percentage of quotes, our hit ratio, was slightly lower than the same quarter last year. This decline in hit rate suggest some more competitive marketplace for new business; it also demonstrates that we remain unrelenting on our fundamental underwriting discipline, avoiding pricing that is sometimes driven to levels lower than we are willing to delve. Turning to Slide 10, business insurance delivered another strong quarter with operating income up slightly from the same quarter last year. The combined ratio over the quarter was 86.6%, an improvement of approximately 5 points from the first quarter of last year, and as we discussed earlier, driven by favorable prior year development.  Net of the items here, margins deteriorated about 2 points, again about half from the expected deterioration in market conditions and half from the large property loss activity I already mentioned.  Frequency rates in the quarter continued to decline slightly. On Slide 11 you see that net written premiums grew 2% in our core and 1% in total quarter-over-quarter. In spite of the softening in the marketplace we delivered a solid performance as the result of our strong, diversified product platform and our depth of distribution. Turning to financial profession and international insurance on Slide 12, the segment continued to produce very positive results with operating income up 33% from the same quarter last year driven primarily by positive prior year development in our international operations.  The combined ratio improved 8 points quarter-over-quarter from 89.4% to 81.4%, again affected by the prior year. Even net of this development FPI\u2019s combined ratio was a very solid 88.8%. The business continues to perform at very profitable levels. FPI net written premiums were up 7% for the quarter, 11% when you exclude our Mexican surety premium from 2007.  Bond and financial products premium quarter-over-quarter was up 30% primarily due to changes in our reinsurance treaties.  We saw strong production in the construction services portion of our surety business. This growth was offset by reductions in liability lines where new business pricing is very competitive. International premiums decreased due to exposure reductions in travel and personal accident insurance products at Lloyd\u2019s, the underwriting actions we took to limit Canadian quake exposure, and increased reinsurance costs. These factors more than offset the impact of favorable foreign exchange rate movements. Last quarter we spoke at length regarding the potential implications of financial sector stress in our management liability and surety industry exposures. Since then we have continued to monitor developments in the marketplace and assess our potential exposure. The conclusions remain the same. As we told you last quarter, the 2008 guidance incorporates the results of our ongoing analysis of D&O exposure to disruption in the capital markets and the estimate in the 2008 guidance is not materially different from the estimated losses for 2007. We are comforted by both our diversity and profitability of business in the management liability and surety lines and our management liability and surety business continues to meet our return thresholds. So overall, our results in this quarter were really strong, and in light of the current market conditions we believe outstanding. Solid margins, great retention levels, modest price declines on a retained book, and a significant flow of new business opportunities has allowed us to modestly grow the top line in a very disciplined way and we believe this reflects our strong underwriting culture. In short, [inaudible-audio scratch] that are competitive advantages really matter and probably matter most in toughest market conditions. So with that, let me turn it over to Joe Lacher to cover personal lines.\nJoseph Lacher: Thanks, Brian. Looking at Page 13, personal insurance segments produced solid results with a combined ratio of 92% and $181 million in operating earnings. Continued to deliver strong production results with consistent retention, renewal pricing and year-over-year [inaudible] growth in both the auto and the property line. When comparing the quarter\u2019s profitability with the first quarter of 2007, earnings were down $85 million and the combined ratio was up 6.7 points. This was driven by several things. First, results were impacted by increased non-catastrophe weather-related claim frequency. Brian spoke about some of that a moment ago. This increased the combined ratio by 3.2 points. Additionally, the impact of lower net investment income and the absence of the one-time accounting expense benefit related to the fixed value-based agent compensation, discussed previously, also impacted the segment. Turning specifically to property on Page 14, we posted another quarter of strong results. Policies in force increased 3% versus the prior year\u2019s quarter, retention remained at 86%, and the renewal price change of 6% was a bit lower than we have experienced in the last four quarters. Our combined ratio of 85% for the quarter was very strong despite the increase in non-catastrophe weather-related activity.  We continue to be pleased with the reception and the early results of Quantum Home, our homeowners product utilizing our industry-leading product segmentation. Over the last quarter the product was implemented in 7 additional markets, bringing our total to 38 states plus the District of Columbia. We are on track to roll out the remaining targeted states throughout 2008. Looking at our auto business, we are pleased with our production results, which are consistent with recent quarters. Retention remains stable at 83%, renewal price change was 1%. Excluding the impact of the Mendota sales and policies in force increased 2% over the prior year quarter. Our auto combined ratio for the quarter was 99%, up 12 points from a year ago\u2019s 87% combined. Let\u2019s turn to Page 15 and I will try to help you appropriately compare these numbers and to project our run rate going forward. First, we do not believe that the 12 point differential between quarters is reflective of the change in underlying underwriting results. There were several non-run rate items affecting comparability. First, the auto combined for the first quarter of 2007 benefited 5 points from net favorable prior year reserve development and from the timing impact of the transition to the fixed value-based agent compensation program. Neither of these items benefited the first quarter of 2008. Additionally, the first quarter of 2008 experienced a level of non-catastrophe weather-related losses, which we believe are outside of what would be considered normal. This adversely impacted the quarter\u2019s auto combined ratio by 2 points. Excluding these items, the combined moved from 92% to 97%. The normalized 97% is very comparable to the full year 2007 normalized combined ratio of 95%. The differential between these normalized numbers is attributable to the impact of market conditions, which include loss inflation being somewhat above rate changes, and to a small increase in expense ratio. Looking forward, we anticipate an auto combined ratio in the high-90s, or something 2-4 points above the normalized 2000 levels.  This should presumably go without saying, but for clarity, the total company 2008 guidance incorporates an assumption of a 1.5 point increase in the total company combined ratio. The anticipated changes in the auto combined ratio are incorporated, and have been incorporated, into all of our guidance communications. Turning to Page 16, we\u2019re seeing loss inflation in low- to mid-single digits, excluding the anticipated impacts from the broader risk profile of Quantum. Similar to recent quarters, we\u2019re seeing this driven by low- to mid-single digit increases in frequency with severity trend essentially flat. I\u2019m going to turn to the market for just a moment before passing it back to Jay. In our experience, the auto marketplace remains competitive. That being said, we\u2019re seeing more auto rate increase activity being initiated across the marketplace. Our activity reflects that trend. In the first quarter of 2008 we generated nearly twice as many auto rate filings as we had done in the first quarter of 2007. We anticipate similar activity for the next several quarters. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks, Joe. Net investment income is shown on Page 17. It was $650 million dollars after-tax, significantly below recent quarters. NII for the fixed income portfolio, which remained very strong and was up $11 million from the prior year quarter, was impacted somewhat from lower short-term rates. The non-fixed income portfolio, however, produced only $27 million of NII in the current quarter as compared to $127 million in the prior year quarter.  It is important to note that this portion of the portfolio, like the fixed income portfolio, produced a positive return and was not impacted by significant write downs. When compared to prior quarters, the low level of non-fixed-income-related NII resulted from lower real estate and private equity partnership gains due to low transaction volumes given current market conditions. Overall our after-tax yield was 3.5 % for the quarter. Page 18 provides updated information concerning our guidance for full year 2008. We now expect fully-diluted operating income per share of $5.55-$5.85, which compares to our previous range of $5.40-$5.75, and which would still generate an operating return on equity of approximately 13%-14%. Our revised guidance incorporates the first quarter net favorable prior year reserve development and the 1.5 point increase in our full year underlying combined ratio that Brian discussed. It also assumes a continuation of lower short-term interest rates and the more challenging environment we experienced in the first quarter for non-fixed income investment returns. Our guidance also assumes full year CAT losses of $525 million pre-tax and $340 million after-tax, or $0.56 per share after-tax, which represents our average annual loss expectancy as indicated by our CAT modeling, no further prior year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable, slight growth in average investment assets after approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases, and a revised weighted average diluted share count of approximately $612 million after share repurchases and employee equity awards. And with that, we would like to now open it up for any questions that you might have.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Thanks very much. I was hoping we could get a bit of insight on the outlook for the net investment income line, sort of in the two pieces of so-called fixed income and the other, given the gyrations of the credit markets.\nJay S. Fishman: You\u2019re speaking now, Jay, about the guidance for the remainder of the year and what or assumption is with respect to it?\nJay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Correct.\nJay S. Fishman: We\u2019ve assumed that quarters two, three, and four for this year are just the same as Q1. And in fact, if you look at the guidance you will see obviously that we increased it for the actual realized favorable development in the first quarter and then decreased it for the difference in net investment income. So we are now simply assuming that two, three, and four are virtually identical to one.\nJay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then on the guidance\u2014I guess this is more of a comment than a question, but just going back in my model, Travelers has had reserve releases for the past 13 quarters, so I\u2019m just not sure I understand why you always assume you\u2019re not going to have any going forward, given I think most of the estimates on the Street assume for the reserve releases.\nJay S. Benet: This is Jay Benet. The rules that we operate under certainly cause us to look at all facts and circumstances that we know of at a particular point in time to estimate what our reserves are. And from that we make our best estimate. So, we\u2019re not, in our reserving processes, trying to create a circumstance where we are necessarily developing reserves in favorable or unfavorable ways. They do represent best estimates. There are factors at work, however, that impact our reserves and those factors include things like the claim initiatives that we have, changes in the [inaudible] environment; all kinds of things that we\u2019re constantly updating. And as those factors emerge, we\u2019ve been very fortunate in looking at things that have been positive for our reserve development. So we would hope that they would continue, we don\u2019t know that they will, and we just at any point in time come up with what we really believe to be the best estimate of what we believe the reserve should be.\nJay S. Fishman: Jay, I would just add to that the process that we go through to evaluate reserve is extensive and rigorous and fairly company-wide. And I don\u2019t fully understand how people can have visibility through reserve development that they would feel comfortable incorporating into guidance when in fact the process that generates that conclusion hasn\u2019t occurred and doesn\u2019t occur until the future. So I think if you have enough visibility to reserve development then we\u2019d be comfortable in encouraging you to incorporate it in our view of guidance. I can\u2019t figure out why you wouldn\u2019t recognize it in earnings. So we let the process run its course. It\u2019s a rigorous, controlled process and actuaries do exactly what they\u2019re supposed to do and we\u2019re hopeful that there will be a more favorable development, but it\u2019s impossible to predict.\nJay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: That\u2019s a fair point. And then my final question is on surety. We\u2019ve heard some rumblings about there being a bit more stress on the homebuilders\u2019 side, with regard to the residential subdivision improvements. Can you update us on that issue?\nBrian W. MacLean: Jay, this is Brian. Yes, we clearly monitor it very closely. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, our market share exposures in that segment are significantly less than our broader surety market shares, but we\u2019re still a decent player.\nJay S. Fishman: I\u2019m not aware of any change and we obviously can update this and if it turns out that it\u2019s different we will. I believe we had, at the end of the fourth quarter one notice of claim in the subdivision book and I\u2019m not aware of any change since then. So, we\u2019ve been reading the same things you have in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times on pressure in the housing market, but it hasn\u2019t evidenced itself yet, in any event, in defaults in any serious way in the subdivision business. And we should check those claim numbers because I\u2019m speaking really very much from memory. I don\u2019t have a fact book sitting next to me with the numbers, but that is my recollection, and we\u2019ll confirm the numbers.  I think that really is a function of the nature of our business. It\u2019s a narrow book; I think we had 65 individual programs that are in place. They are largely with well-capitalized\u2014at least for the housing industry\u2014kinds of developers. I think we\u2019re at the cream of the crop in that regard but obviously things can always change perspectively.\nJay Gelb - Lehman Brothers: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.\nBrian W. MacLean: We actually\u2014we did do that stress test that we displayed in our year-end call and we revisited that and it\u2019s no different than what we showed before.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alain Karaoglan with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed.\nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: Good morning. I have a few questions. The first one is on the financial products business. The accident year combined ratio actually improved this quarter versus last year. That\u2019s surprising given that rates are declining, some of the lost cost trends in that area may be increasing. Could you comment on that, what\u2019s occurring? Was there anything unusual last year in the accident year combined ratio?\nBrian W. MacLean: It\u2019s primarily shifting and mix in products there. And as you know, some of those products have dramatically different profitability targets and combined ratio targets and as we\u2019ve shifted some of that book that\u2019s had probably the biggest single impact there.\nJay S. Fishman: I\u2019m thinking back to the fourth quarter analysis we did, Alain, and one of the things that we shared with you and I remember Brian mentioning it here was that our analysis of the management liability exposure from the capital markets disruption fit actually within the estimated loss pick that we had established last year and frankly still believe that that holds true in respect with the loss pick of this year. So, your comment about loss trends increasing, I\u2019m not sure I understand that. At least as it relates to our business. And what we\u2019re showing here obviously is [inaudible] but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen anything yet in our financial and professional services businesses that cause us to believe that the loss ratios, or loss experiences, in that businesses are going to be historically out of character.\nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: Okay. The next question is on the personal auto segment. You\u2019re getting combined ratios that are starting to get below your targeted return on capital. The expense ratio is 28 points which is significantly higher than some of your competitors and in the past you mentioned that you looked at the combined ratio overall, so as long as that was below the target it was fine. Now we\u2019re above that. How long will you tolerate a combined ratio that\u2019s at 97% or above, in order to achieve your goals? And when would you expect the expense ratio to get back to a more normalized rate, given what you\u2019re spending on that front?\nJay S. Fishman: Great question. What we look at all the time is, again, the combined ratio and it\u2019s projected move going forward. We have a target range of profitability, we\u2019ve talked about that a number of times, and go through a rigorous process to review that. Our projection for the full year is that we\u2019ll be within that target profitability range. We\u2019ll be at the higher end of that range, but we\u2019ll be within that target profitability. We are very actively watching the marketplace, we see conditions where in general wash trends are exceeding rates, and that\u2019s not inconsistent with, I think, every piece of data you guys have seen, and as a result we\u2019ve stepped up and increased our rate activity.  And I mentioned in my prepared comments that we had virtually doubled, or nearly doubled, the number of auto rate filings in the first quarter of 2008 than we did in the first quarter of 2007. Those were biased towards increases and we anticipate continuing that activity in the next couple of quarters to respond to all of those pressures on profitability.  Now that will take a while to earn in. As you go through rate changes. Which is why we expect the combined to be a little higher through part of this year. But the benefits of those rate changes will come in the back part of this year and in the next year. Speak with Joe about your anecdotal observations about trends and [inaudible] in the industry.\nJoseph Lacher: In terms of the loss trends, Jay?\nJay S. Fishman: No, filing. Filing trends.\nJoseph Lacher: What we\u2019re seeing, and we talked about this a little bit last quarter, we saw a reduction in the number of rate decreases in the fourth quarter and increase in the number of rate increases. That same trend was visible, and a little bit more so, in the first quarter. So we do think the marketplace is moving towards some increased level of increasing rate activity.\nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: And Liberty Mutual announced yesterday that they\u2019re buying Safeco. Do you have a view on whether that\u2019s going to give you opportunities in terms of attracting agents or books of business, or do you think that\u2019s going to lead to a more competitive environment as both will try and retain the business that they have on the books?\nJay S. Fishman: I don\u2019t think, given the size of it, that it\u2019s going to change very much. I think we all compete aggressively every day, heads up, and we try our best to knock each other out\u2014I say that tongue in cheek of course. I\u2019m just saying that we do compete aggressively; I think we\u2019ll continue to compete aggressively and whether Safeco is an independently traded company or owned by Liberty Mutual, I don\u2019t expect to change the competitive environment at all.\nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: And would it give you any opportunities on books of business or things like that?\nJay S. Fishman: I don\u2019t know, Alain. I just don\u2019t know.\nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: Okay. And just a clarification. You mentioned the gap combined ratio guidance increase of 1.5 points. Is the starting point on 97 the 90% combined ratio?\nJay S. Fishman: It would be the prior year ex-CATs, ex-prior year developments, and ex-the impact of the agent commission change.\nBrian W. MacLean: We have that number.\nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: And I just want to confirm that it\u2019s 90%.\nJay S. Fishman: We\u2019ll get it for you.\nAlain Karaoglan - Banc of America Securities: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann of JP Morgan. Please proceed.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Hi. Good morning. Jay, just a question. You made a comment about increasing sales with additional products through existing customers. I know that that\u2019s something that you talked about in the past, but I was wondering if you could give us some examples of where you\u2019re having some success doing that?\nJay S. Fishman: I\u2019m not sure who the question\u2014I don\u2019t think I made reference to it.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: I think in the press release it was noted.\nJay S. Fishman: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\nBrian W. MacLean: This is Brian. I think where that\u2019s really starting to have traction is obviously in the commercial areas. Both small commercial and middle-market. One of the things we\u2019ve really been driving in our whole Travelers Express roll out is to expand our appetite in small commercial from what was previously a significantly heavily weighted CMP book of business to a much more balanced comp and auto business. And we feel great about that. And we\u2019ve had some real traction there. Part of that is the technology and, you know, the Travelers Express for comp has been rolling out and will be fully out by the end of the year. So that\u2019s been a big part of it. The other piece is in our, broadly speaking, middle-market environment where we have done a much better job as a company--and really, this is a journey we\u2019ve been on for three or four years now--to really preserve our specialized product industry underwriting focus, but at the same time come at the marketplace\u2014both agents and customers\u2014with a more of a connected view. So we\u2019ve been fairly significantly increasing from market customers our penetration in different products for those customers. So it\u2019s selling the comp and the auto where we sell the liability or vice versa or whatever, and the property. But we\u2019ve had some real traction there.\nJay S. Fishman: Do you want to comment about embedding products at all?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. Another way to do that is to take some of our specialized product from the line of business prospective and embedding those coverages right into the product that we sell. So it could be some of the professional liability coverages, it could be a lot of different things, where we. . . We\u2019ve had a lot of success with boiler, for example. We\u2019ve embedded the boiler coverage right into our standard offering and have really had some dramatic impacts from that.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: And that last comment you made, is that specific to the industry focused underwriting or is that more broadly than that even?\nBrian W. MacLean: It would be a little more broadly. I mean, there\u2019s a decent amount of that that would be going through Select. So how do we take some of those products and embed them into our Select offering so that we\u2019re selling lots of it to a broad array of customers.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. The other question I have is you made mention\u2014well, the press release made mention and I forget whether it was Brian or Jay\u2014the increasing retentions in bond financial international. What product specifically did you increase the net retentions there?\nBrian W. MacLean: It was primarily in our surety business.\nJay S. Fishman: And it was an active decision based upon loss experience versus cost. The loss experience in the business that had been seeded out has been pretty solid and comparing it against the cost of seeding that business out, it just made sense to retain it.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: And was that a function in changing XOL, or pro rata?\nJay S. Fishman: The XOL.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Smith of GIAA. Please proceed.\nJosh Smith \u2013 GIAA: Hi. Thanks for taking the call. In the December presentation you gave some detail on claim counts for the management liability. Can you update us on those for 2007 claims and 2008 claims?\nBrian W. MacLean: You now, Josh, we gave a lot of detail last quarter. We really don\u2019t want to get into a quarter-by-quarter claim count of a fairly micro issue here. Again, I would go back to\u2014we\u2019ve clearly been watching very closely. We\u2019ve update regularly all of our analyses and we come to the identical, same conclusions that we told you about last quarter.\nJay S. Fishman: There clearly have been more claims, and we do know what they are. I\u2019m not suggesting that we don\u2019t but I think it\u2019s appropriate to say that the claim activity is consistent with the loss provisions that we made in 2007 and remains very consistent with the guidance that we\u2014or the loss provisions that we\u2019ve incorporated into the guidance for 2008.\nJosh Smith \u2013 GIAA: Great. And just a clarification on your guidance. You talked about the combined ratio being up 1.5 points, but auto up 2%-4%. Does that imply that everything else is down, and if so, why would that be with pricing getting tougher, other than mix shift?\nJay S. Fishman: I think maybe we\u2019re confusing something, but let\u2019s make sure. We originally in the guidance indicated that we expected combined ratio to increase 1 point looking into 2008. And now we\u2019ve increased that to 1.5 points. The principal reason why we\u2019re increasing it to a point and a half is because of what occurred in personal lines in the fourth quarter and that portion of it that\u2014the first quarter; I\u2019m sorry, in the first quarter\u2014and that portion of it that we expect to continue to reoccur in two, three, and four. When you look purely at personal lines, I think that\u2019s the 2.4 points. When you spread it over . . .\nJosh Smith \u2013 GIAA: I got it. I got it. So everything else is up as you expected but personal is a little bit more and that\u2019s going to bring it up.  Okay. Thank you.\nJay S. Benet: The other thing that I would add, and that\u2019s to answer Alain\u2019s question from before. You know the basis for that analysis was a 90% combined ratio last year for the full year ex-CATs, ex-prior year development, and ex- the impact for the change in the agents\u2019 comp.\nJay S. Fishman: So you were absolutely on target, Alain. Good for you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg from Langen McAlenney. Please proceed.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney: Good morning. I\u2019m just wondering if with the strength of your balance sheet and the dislocations in financial markets, whether Bill Heyman is perhaps looking to increase the risk profile at all of your investment portfolio, taking advantage of some of those dislocations?\nWilliam H. Heyman: Hi. This is Bill Heyman. We come in every day and comb the secondary markets for bargains. There are actually fewer than the newspapers make it sound. Much of the money that has been lost by some of our competitors has been on products where there was a lot to embedded leverage or where they took leverage. The actual market prices of financial assets provide some bargains and we have found a few. But we haven\u2019t piled in wholesale yet. First of all, we\u2019re not sure that this is the final level. And second, our attitude towards risk is pretty consistent. We think all things being equal, there is virtue in being able to tell a simple story on the asset side. We think complexity of products has direct relationship to liquidity. And we\u2019re big enough to assume some liquidity risks, but we want to be paid for it. That said, we\u2019re in every day. We found a few things but we\u2019re not, at this point, inclined to radically change our risk profile.\nJay S. Fishman: And, Larry, that\u2019s not to say that we\u2019ve not been approached with opportunities to do things that would be different from what we\u2019ve done before and as anyone should be now, we\u2019re open minded: we look, we do due diligence, we analyze. And so far we\u2019re very comfortable where we are. But our eyes are wide open. And we did speak to that very specifically in the press release, the comment that--not having issues right now gives us two, I think, significant luxuries. The luxury of being able to just focus on our business, which really is a great time to be able to do that. And secondly, the luxury of being able to consider alternatives and we\u2019ll see where they go.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman of Adage Capital. Please proceed.\nIan Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital: Hi. Just a couple of quick ones. First, the expense ratio was up close to a couple of points. I know probably about half of that is the change in the contingents, but the other point, can you explain what\u2019s going on there and what your plans are to address that? I know obviously Jay has a past of being very successful in cutting expenses in this kind of environment.\nJay S. Fishman: Was it one or 1.4 points? I remember 1.4 points attributable to the age in comp. But, look, I think\u2014and I\u2019ve said this before\u2014that we continue to be extraordinarily focused on being cost-conscious. Gel, for example, put out an announcement a couple of weeks ago now, that we were consolidating nine service centers into seven. We were effectively eliminating two person line service centers. And the reason for that is we now have the technology and the infrastructure to be able to handle it in those centers. So we\u2019re going to continue to do that and find opportunities. And whether we were making more money or less money doesn\u2019t change that focus. That focus exists regardless of the environment we\u2019re in.  Simultaneously, you can\u2019t not to continue to make the kinds of investments that have been really remarkable, I think, in the story of this company. It would have been easy not to have invested in Quantum Auto and in the early days our results would have looked better, but from a competitive position now we wouldn\u2019t be nearly in the position that we are. And the comments that I made about Travelers Express, we\u2019re just spot on in the same regard. To talk about a submission rate that\u2019s up 50% is, in my experience, unheard of and it really is a perfect application of providing a technological need to an agent desire that supports both businesses. And that will produce real results. One of the issue we, as senior management, face all the time is the trade off between being thoughtful about making those investments recognizing that they pay off over time. So I think we\u2019re going to be\u2014I think we are going to continue to be relentless about managing our expense base, but we\u2019re also running this for the long-term value creation and we\u2019re going to continue to make the investments that make sense.  And to some extent, the expense ratio will be what it will be. And it\u2019s not because we drive\u2014it\u2019s easy to run a business targeting to an expense ratio; it\u2019s also easy to not be successful that way. I think the way that you\u2019re successful is to look at it project by project, dispersement by dispersement, and wrestle with it and that is our orientation. That\u2019s what we did in the early days to drive the expense base down. And that\u2019s what we do now to make sure the money that we spend is worth spending.\nIan Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital: And I agree with all of that. I guess I was just trying to understand a little bit better\u2014between Quantum and Express, is there a bit of a bulge in the investment spending that might decline a year from now or do you think that\u2019s just the way the game is now, that you\u2019re constantly going to be competitive and the leading edge, there\u2019s always going to be this level of investment spending?\nJay S. Fishman: Yes. And again, to sit as a CEO, and say that regardless of the environment, we\u2019re going to continue to act in a certain way, I think is fool-hardly. Given the environment that we envision\u2014and in fact the environment that we\u2019re in right now\u2014we\u2019re going to continue to spend, we\u2019re going to continue to invest.  And this is\u2014you know, I look back on the last two years, we had a return on equity of 18% round numbers in each of the last two years. Our guidance points us to 13%-14% return on equity this year, in spite of a, I think, an unprecedented investment arena. We just feel terrific about how the company is positioned. Truthfully, I\u2019m not sure I could feel a whole lot better about it. And we\u2019re going to continue to find those opportunities.  Now, if five years from now we\u2019re looking at a market that is dramatically different, then the thresholds for investment go up and the kinds of returns that are demanded go up and we\u2019ll gear it back. But in the near-term I think it would be inappropriate to assume that there\u2019s any dramatic spending reduction that you\u2019re going to see out of here.\nIan Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital: Okay, great. And then just one quick numbers question. The change in the surety insurance, will that benefit net premium the next three quarters as well, or was it a one-time benefit in Q2 through Q4 gross?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, it\u2019s a one-time shot. Don\u2019t expect a 30% bump.\nIan Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital: I got it. And that\u2019s just true for written or is it true for earned as well?\nJay S. Benet: It earns out over the quarters.\nJay S. Fishman: And I know you\u2019re thoughtful enough to recognize this, but when you\u2019re retaining more, the impact to the bottom line is simply the difference between what the cost of the session would have been and what provision you\u2019re going to make on the business that\u2019s being retained. So, don\u2019t assume that the change in the retention produces a dramatic change in profitability. It\u2019s on the margin.\nIan Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital: I know. Exactly. I just wanted to make sure when I run it through my model I do it correctly.\nJay S. Fishman: Great.\nIan Gutterman \u2013 Adage Capital: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch: Thank you. You know, I was looking at the pure price changes that you highlighted in your presentation and on the commercial side it does suggest some stabilization. Should we read into that? Certainly what you hear from others is that it\u2019s not stabilizing, that prices continue to head lower. Sometimes at a faster pace. What can you point to that can account for what looks like a stabilization for you guys?\nJay S. Fishman: I think, Jay, that one of things that, for whatever reason really isn\u2019t internalized, is the extent to which we are a small-flow business company and a middle-market company. If you look at how this organization arose, it arose by companies that had a focus on writing small-flow business and guaranteed-cost middle-market business.  So when you look at Select, or when you look at some of the other business insurance, or even in the commercial accounts, a lot of that really represents and affects small commercial business. And our experience consistently has been that the smaller end of the business is less price-sensitive and the largest end of the business is the most.  So, I think one way to put in context the comments about rate\u2014and we watch everyone obviously\u2014is to understand the mix of business that\u2019s being done. We are not a large-account casualty writer. I\u2019m not saying you won\u2019t find any, but as a matter of the business that we do, we are not a large-account guaranteed-cost casualty writer. And I think that when you look at companies that do that, that you will find that the price sensitivity, both up and down, tends to be more dramatic. We do write some large account national property business. That has a pricing dynamic that\u2019s really very much unto itself and acts almost like a market that\u2019s unique. I think if you look at the other companies that write small commercial kind of middle-market business that write\u2014and we do compare it and it is now publicly available. I think you\u2019ll see that the rates look remarkably alike.  I think our advantage shows up--and we presented this information in the fourth quarter\u2014in retention rates that have been historically higher than the companies that we would think about as competitors in those lines of business. And again, no one else has reported in the first quarter of the companies that I\u2019m talking about so it\u2019s hard for me to comment about what they\u2019re going to say. I just, when I look at the rate experience that we\u2019ve talked about over the last year, the rate looks very much like the companies against we compete in these various segments.\nBrian W. MacLean: And with that said, Jay, we\u2019re not reading anything directionally into the quarter. It is clearly a little better than the last couple of quarters. As I said in my comments, it\u2019s marginally better than what we had expected for the quarter. We don\u2019t see it as a sign, though, of anything fundamental. Obviously if next quarter it\u2019s a little bit better we\u2019ll start thinking about that, but right now we think the market conditions are pretty much what we\u2019ve been seeing for the last quarter or so.\nJay S. Fishman: Well, I think it can get confusing to think of first derivatives and second derivatives here. Our numbers in that first quarter of 2008 in pure rate are still down. They are not down more than they were in the fourth quarter, but they are still trending down. I think it\u2019s hard to declare, looking at this, that anything is bottoming out. I think that you could look at and speculate as to whether the rate of decline in this quarter has flattened out. But I do come back to I think that the competitive advantages I spoke about earlier evidence themselves in higher retentions but that the rate arena in which we compete looks a great deal like the other best companies\u2014the best companies\u2014that we would consider the competitors in those segments.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Small with Bear Stearns. Please proceed.\nDavid Small \u2013 Bear Stearns: Good morning. In terms of the reserve development, could you tell us which accident years that reserve development is coming from?\nJay S. Benet: The reserve development is actually spread out amongst a large number of our individual businesses and product lines. But it\u2019s probably concentrated in terms of more recent accident years\u2014I don\u2019t mean the most recent\u2014when it came to liability\u2014but probably in the 2003, 2004, 2005 time frame. There is an amount that relates to property and property, of course, you see in a shorter time span, so there it\u2019s probably more like 2007.\nDavid Small \u2013 Bear Stearns: Okay. And in your prepared comments and in your package here you talked about your liquidity. Given that liquidity, could you talk a little more about your M&A strategy and kind of where you would be looking to kind of build out your business?\nJay S. Fishman: I don\u2019t think we have an M&A strategy. We focus on our business strategy, which is growing our business and coming in each morning and doing what it is we do. I\u2019ve said before, it would be irresponsible for management to say they wouldn\u2019t look or consider opportunities that come along and again, I\u2019ve spoken previously about the fact that given the strength of this franchise and the breadth, that the focus in any transaction is creating shareholder value\u2014and that\u2019s the only reason is that we\u2019re in business is to create shareholder value\u2014then any transaction would have to overcome a very high hurdle of reserve risk and people risk and undisclosed liability risks and all the people risks and all that goes with it.  So I simply would like to say that we would look at things that would come along or be available, we would do very rigorous due diligence, we\u2019re not pig-n-poke kinds of people. We would do rigorous due diligence, we would evaluate the risk and the opportunity and that opportunity would have to compare very attractively against a very high hurdle of risks, because frankly, I just don\u2019t think we need much to build out our shareholder value. I think we have the products and the people; I think we\u2019ve got what a company needs to fulfill it\u2019s mission and so you just keep doing it. That\u2019s as close of an answer that I can give you.\nDavid Small \u2013 Bear Stearns: The one thing that I guess you left off in that answer is geographic diversity. I would agree with everything you said in the U.S. Would you be looking to, at all, expand internationally?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, we have operations right now in Canada and the UK and Ireland, and obviously at Lloyd\u2019s. And they\u2019re very good franchises and we\u2019re interested in growing them. And we have a real focus on growing them organically. And so when you say would we be interested in growing our business outside the U.S., I would love for our UK business to do more, and I would love for them to do it at profitable levels.  We disclosed that we are looking seriously about a joint venture opportunity in India, but it\u2019s obviously long-term in nature and if we\u2019re able to consummate it, it would be small and not particularly material. I just look over the next 20 years and fundamentally believe that there will be enormous opportunity there and now is the time to establish oneself, so we are actively engaged in that. I think the notion of opening up, planting a flag, in continental Europe or elsewhere\u2014these are over-insured areas where there are way too many companies and way too little demand and the notion of starting up an operation and sticking a flag in the ground just doesn\u2019t make at all sense. You may know that the St. Paul had operations in lots of countries around the world. We closed them down; closed most of them down. And then when you get to the notion of an acquisition, I fall right back to my previous comment, which is that anything that we look at would have to be subject to due diligence and compare itself against a very high hurdle of risk and once you start talking about companies that conduct themselves in far-flung areas in different regulatory regimes in different time zones in different languages, that simply ramps that risk hurdle up even further. So, we feel very good about what we\u2019ve got and got plenty to do here in the U.S., in Canada and the UK and Ireland. We think we can create shareholder value with what\u2019s in front of us and we\u2019re off and running.\nDavid Small \u2013 Bear Stearns: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Dan Johnson with Citadel. Please proceed.\nDan Johnson \u2013 Citadel: Thank you very much. Two questions, if we could, please. The first is can we talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of worker\u2019s comp pricing? I know it\u2019s very state-specific but assuming if your mix doesn\u2019t change maybe we can try to talk at a more national level.\nJay S. Fishman: Comp is obviously a line that\u2019s gotten some publicity lately. We are a significant player in comp, broadly. We do a lot in the loss-sensitive service and carrier business. On the guaranteed cost side\u2014you know, again, it is state specific so it is hard to generalize. We feel pretty decent about comp opportunities around the country\u2014and again, broadly speaking\u2014particularly in the small commercial area. So, again, I\u2019m hesitating because there are some areas that are such exceptions to that story that you have to be careful with the comment. But overall, comp pricing is we think fundamentally under control and loss trend has been relatively behaving.  We\u2019ve done a lot of work on looking at loss trends, we spend a lot of time talking to CCI, we\u2019ve looked at a lot of different medical trends that are going on and in the aggregate we feel pretty good that are some really good opportunities. There are also some other places where it\u2019s a real problem.\nDan Johnson \u2013 Citadel: I ask because it\u2019s the one place where you\u2019re still generating double-digit written premium growth and I [inaudible] even larger amount of unit growth. So if we could just spend a second there on some of why worker\u2019s comp [inaudible]\nJay S. Fishman: And again, just to summarize the other thing. I mean, rate is still shrinking and is a negative in comp. So it\u2019s in the aggregate, across all markets, across all states. Not unlike the rest of the products. You know, I think specifically for us as much as we have been a major player in loss-sensitive worker\u2019s comp, we have historically been a very conservative player in guaranteed-cost worker\u2019s comp. And I think there a couple of very focused opportunities for us; small commercial probably being at the head of that issue, of that line, but not exclusive, where we think we\u2019ve got opportunities in different markets in different geographies to grow that business and we\u2019ve been much more conscious of trying to do that thoughtfully. And actually leveraging our knowledge of the marketplace from our less sensitive book as opposed to not being as big a participant as we would be. This is interesting because it\u2019s not\u2014because it\u2019s loss-sensitive it\u2019s not visible in our financials as much as other business is, but we manage somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion of claims for large companies that we manage on a fee-for-service basis and we hold ourselves out as experts in producing favorable worker\u2019s compensation outcomes. Our [inaudible] product that we market aggressively has been successful. So managing, in effect, other people\u2019s risks, with their money, we\u2019ve been very successful.  We asked ourselves a couple of years ago, strategically, if we felt to good about handling other people\u2019s claims, why didn\u2019t we feel as good about managing in effect our own money\u2019s claims. And so we made a very conscious and dedicated effort to take the expertise from our loss-sensitive worker\u2019s comp business and move it down into the guaranteed-cost business and yet go at it selectively. And what we\u2019re seeing here is the by-product of that strategy as a result of it.\nDan Johnson \u2013 Citadel: When you think of the duration of those liabilities, obviously you can live with the higher targeted combined, can you give us a sense of where those targeted combines would be for that line of business?\nJay S. Fishman: We typically do\u2014directionally, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s a longer tail business so it would have a higher target combined. We don\u2019t disclose those discretely, I would think, line by line. We hold all of our lines of business to the same ROE targets and that\u2019s a range, I think we\u2019ve said in the past, 13%-18% return from our different products so it\u2019s clearly in there. I just want to make sure I give you the right number on that. Our national account business I said is $2 billion-$3 billion\u2014we\u2019ve got the actual numbers here we can give you.\nDan Johnson \u2013 Citadel: The Katrina reserve relief, was that $65 million both in the reserve or do we figure as well as a [inaudible].\nJay S. Fishman: First of all, I\u2019m not sure I heard you. It\u2019s 55. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what you said. It\u2019s in the reserve relief number, it\u2019s not a contra CAT in our CAT numbers for the quarter.\nDan Johnson \u2013 Citadel: I understood. Thank you very much.\nJay S. Fishman: And, Dan, I can confirm the [inaudible] under management are approximately $2.5 billion dollars.\nDan Johnson \u2013 Citadel: Very good. Thanks, again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session and our conference call. Thank you for your participation.

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you\u2019ll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, January 26, 2010.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Pama. Good morning and welcome to the Travelers discussion of our full year 2009 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the investor section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Typically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserves and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention Travelers operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that maybe non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the investor section on our website, www.travelers.com. With that done, here is a Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. By now you\u2019ve seen our fourth quarter results and clearly they stand on their own merits. For the quarter, we reported record net income as well as record net and operating income per diluted share. For the year we reported net income in excess of $3.6 billion and return on equity of 13.5%. In the quarter, we repurchased 30.1 million common shares for just over $1.5 billion and for the year we repurchased 69.4 million common shares for approximately $3.3 billion. Throughout the past year, we have continued to capitalize on our competitive advantages to generate top tier profits and return excess capital to shareholders thereby producing attractive returns. Jay and Brian will have more to say about our results in a few minutes. What I would like to do is to take the next few minutes and give you a broader perspective on our recent history and what it means to you. In the five full fiscal years, since the combination of Travelers into St. Paul, we have clearly distinguished ourselves amongst financial service companies in terms of overall financial performance. Our cumulative earnings from continuing operations have totaled over $17 billion. We have achieved a cumulative average annual return on equity from continuing operations of 14.1%. We\u2019ve returned $13 billion of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and common dividends, and our average annual growth in book value per share and dividend per share has been 10.9% and 8.4% respectively. This performance has resulted in a total return to shareholders defined by share price appreciation and the reinvestment of dividends, which ranks us as a top performing financial service company. On page four of the webcast, you can see our five, three and two year total return performance compared to a significant number of leading U.S. listed financial service companies including the 20 largest Standard & Poor\u2019s financials by market capitalization. In each time period, our total return ranks us no lower than sixth. On page five of the webcast, you can see similar statistics for the Dow 30 industrial average companies. We\u2019re very proud of these results and we believe that they are the result of well executed strategies. We know that many of you focus intensely on the rate dynamics of our business. Brian is going to discuss in detail our rate levels across all three of our business segments, but in summary, the impact of renewal rate changes on renewal premiums remained positive in the quarter across all three business segments. Nonetheless, while we agree that pricing is an important aspect in our business, it is not the only competitive lever by a long shot. Where we believe we are different from so many in our industry is in the exceptional value we provide to our customers, brokers and agents through the breadth of products and services we provide. In the last five years, we have made significant investments in our franchise to enhance this value, whether it is developing technology platforms such as TravelersExpress and Floridian Auto & Home to help agents more easily do more business with us. Introducing new products including our growing suite of middle market industry edge products to meet the specialized and changing needs of our customers, redesigning our claim processes or helping our customers minimize their risks through our industry leading risk control services, we are constantly looking to enhance our value proposition. These investments have been important and we believe they have contributed meaningfully to our ability to differentiate Travelers in a crowded industry. With respect to pricing, we\u2019ve said it before and we\u2019ll say it again, our industry is no different than most. Product pricing is an important element of success and we wrestle with pricing strategy every day. However, we do not believe that our business is a commodity business. Pricing is only one component of competition and agents, brokers and customers have preferences regarding the company with which they choose to do business. Our investments have been geared towards making Travelers a more compelling choice and enhancing our profitability. As we look forward the investment opportunity we will continue to provide is pretty straightforward. We will always manage shareholders capital with a view that on their behalf we should be appropriately compensated for risk that we assume whether it\u2019s on the right side or the left side of the balance sheet. We will continue to build on our competitive advantages as well as continue to seek rate where needed, so that the pricing of our product reflects our long term return expectations. We remain committed to continue returning excess capital as evidenced by the stated assumption in our 2010 guidance of between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in common share repurchases. Before I turn it over to Jay Benet, I\u2019d like to address the subject of providing annual earnings guidance. We\u2019ve thought long and hard about whether the practice is one which we should continue. Our thought process considered the fact that we exclude reserve development from our guidance and catastrophes are fundamentally unpredictable. However, many in the analyst community nonetheless include their own estimates for both. We believe that our core earnings are actually quite predictable given our straightforward approach of running our business and that the level of transparency, clarity and insight that we provide to investors on a regular quarterly basis is industry leading. Given the general nervousness that exists in the financial marketplace, and the risk of individuals misperceiving why we would stop a practice that we\u2019ve been following for sometime, we have decided to continue providing guidance this year consistent with past practice. However, it is our intention to stop providing explicit earnings per share guidance after 2010 and over the next year we will reach out to the investment community to make sure we have a smooth transition. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Jay. Let me refer to page six and start with my usual statement that our balance sheet remains extremely strong and that all of our capital, leverage and liquidity measures were at or better than target levels. In fact, despite supplementing normal dividends paid from our operating companies with a special $500 million fourth quarter operating to holding company dividend. Our operating company capital actually increased to $23.2 billion at the end of the year from $21.5 billion at the beginning of the year. This increase resulted from our very strong fourth quarter results and, to a lesser extent, from the favorable impact of certain fourth quarter regulatory changes. As many of you know, the NAIC recently adopted two rules that the life insurance industry had been pressing for, a temporary rule effective for 2009 and 2010 easing restrictions on the amount of deferred tax assets insurance companies could recognize on their stat balance sheets, and another rule to change requirements for valuing non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities from an approach based upon ratings from traditional rating agencies to one based upon a model developed by PIMCO. While neither of these regulatory changes impacted our GAAP financial statements, the deferred tax asset change and the non-agency RMBS valuation methodology change had the positive effect of increasing operating company capital by approximately $500 million and $100 million respectively. Full year share repurchases were $3.3 billion and common stock dividends were $690 million. Despite accelerating share repurchases in the second half of the year with the intention of lowering holding company liquidity to an amount that was closer to our target level, our strong profitability and the timing of operating company dividends resulted in holding company liquidity of $2.1 billion at year end, exactly where we began the year and almost twice our target level. Our plan is to reduce this amount in 2010. We increased our leverage slightly from 19.5% at the beginning of the year to 20.3% at the end of the year and we increased book value per share by 22% to $52.54, the fifth straight annual increase in book value per share since the Travelers/St. Paul merger. After-tax net realized investment gains were $130 million in the quarter, driven by an after-tax gain of $103 million on the sale of half of our Verisk holdings. Fourth quarter net realized investment gains also included impairments of only $16 million after-tax, and combining this with prior quarters, we recorded a full year after-tax net realized investment gain of $22 million. Total net unrealized investment gains were $2.8 billion on a pre-tax basis at year end, which included only $150 million of investments for which fair value was continuously less than 80% of amortized cost. All in all, we ended 2009 with an extremely strong balance sheet, positioning us very well for our planned increase in share repurchases to a range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in 2010. Page seven provides a comparative analysis of fourth quarter and year-to-date operating income and GAAP combined ratios. Net favorable prior year reserve development was $328 million after-tax in the current quarter, compared to $189 million in the prior year quarter as all three of our business segments once again experienced favorable development. While there were no cats in the quarter, we did experience a very modest increase in estimated cat losses related to several storms that occurred earlier in the year. This in contrast to the benefit we recorded in the prior year quarter from a reduction in loss estimates related to hurricanes that had occurred earlier that year. Also impacting the current quarter, was a $52 million after-tax net benefit from the favorable re-estimation of current year loss ratios, primarily in BI due to better than expected frequency trends. So overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our 2009 underwriting performance. Net investment income of $653 million after-tax is shown on page eight, was up $215 million from the prior year quarter due to a dramatic turnaround in non-fixed income performance. The 7% yield on our non-fixed income portfolio in the current quarter, which was driven by much stronger private equity and hedge fund performance, compared to a negative 14.9% in the prior year quarter, the height of the financial market turmoil. While the 20 basis points after-tax yield on our short term portfolio was considerably lower than the prior year quarter due to the lower rates, the long term fixed-income portfolio\u2019s after-tax yield remained constant at 3.7%. As shown on page nine of the webcast, we achieved a 14% operating return on equity for full year 2009, up from 12.4% in the prior year. Fixed income NII, less interest on our corporate debt, what we refer to as the passage of time component, contributed 8.3 points for the year, down slightly from 2008 due to the lower short term interest rates. Non-fixed income NII, a much smaller contributor to operating ROE, rebounded somewhat from its 2008 level contributing a slightly negative 0.1 points, while the contribution from underwriting income also improved to 5.8 points due to more normal cat losses. Consistent with information we shared with you in recent quarter\u2019s full year operating ROE was negatively impacted by abnormally low yields on non-fixed income and short term investments. Year-to-date, the non-fixed income portfolio yielded a negative 0.6% after-tax, rather than what we considered to be a more normal level of positive 7% and short term rates averaged 0.3% after-tax rather than a more normal level of say 2.5%. Had these investments performed at more normal levels, 2009 full year operating ROE would have been approximately 150 basis points higher. All in all, cumulatively from 2005, we produced an average annual ROE of approximately 14.4% consistent with our stated longer term goal of mid-teens ROE. Brian is now going to provide more in-depth information about our quarterly results.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Turning to the business insurance segment on slide 10, operating earnings were up significantly in the quarter due to improved underwriting results and higher net investment income. The underwriting improvement was driven by increased favorable prior year reserve development and a re-estimation of the current year loss ratio due to overall frequency and commercial auto liability severity both being better than expectations. The combined ratio net of these items and catastrophe losses were up 1.8 points quarter-over-quarter, which is primarily the margin compression we\u2019ve been speaking about throughout 2009. For the full year, the adjusted combined ratio was essentially unchanged as the margin compression was offset by lower large losses and less non-cat weather losses. Net written premiums are down 9% for the quarter and 3% for the year. This is the result of the impact of the economy on our insureds and the next two slides are intended to illustrate how we think about that impact on our written premiums. Slide 11 takes our full year 2008 net written premium and walks through how much of that business we retain and how much new business we wrote. It then measures the change in premium resulting from the increased or decreased in our insureds exposures. In other words, did the accounts we wrote have payrolls, business receipts, vehicles owned, etc., going up or down? So working the slide from left to right, we have full year 2008 net written premium of $11.22 billion. This is essentially the business that was up for renewal in 2009, and we retained 82% of that. For those of you that might be looking for rate on renewed accounts, it was essentially flat for the year. We then wrote new business of $2.2 billion, or 20% of the previous year\u2019s net written premium. So if the insureds exposures for all of 2008 remained constant, we would have grown premiums by 2%. Obviously, these exposures don\u2019t stay constant and, in fact, during most years, they are increasing as the economy expands. We see this in a few different ways, through renewal premium increases as a result of greater insurable values or through audit premium. As many of you know, we go through an audit process in our commercial business and adjust our premiums charged to reflect changes in insureds payrolls, vehicles, property values, etc., but in 2009, the economy didn\u2019t expand and the slide shows the impact. First, the premium changes due to reduced exposures on renewed accounts had a 2% negative impact. In addition, a reduction in audit premium and increased cancellation and endorsement changes resulting from business failures or reduced coverage needs further reduced premiums by 3%. So a long winded, but hopefully clear way of saying that our premiums went from 2% growth to 3% contraction, because our customers\u2019 businesses shrunk and, accordingly, they needed less insurance. The next slide walks through the same analysis for the fourth quarter, and you can see the negative economic impact is even greater driven significantly by audit premium. Since we are auditing accounts, we wrote a full year ago, it makes sense that this dynamic would have worsened over the course of 2009. Similarly, as we look into 2010, it\u2019s logical that the drag will continue through the next few quarters reflecting the economic environment of early 2009. Since we are not economists, we don\u2019t want to start projecting this too far into the future, but if the economy did hit bottom in early 2009, we should see some marginal improvement in these metrics by mid to late 2010. So a lot of words to explain a pretty basic concept, the results are what they are and the economic impact on our insureds is real, but, importantly, given our solid retention, rate and new business dynamics, when the economy does begin to rebound we\u2019re positioned to see some very healthy organic growth. Now before I get into the production statistics, let me take a minute to make clear what we mean when we talk about positive renewal rate change. Every quarter we show you several graphs with premium, rate and exposure change. On slide 13, we\u2019ve tried to very simply portray, that when we say positive rate change, we mean a true rate increase, not just a smaller decrease. Obviously, less negative is better, but it is not adding to premiums and for the last three quarters all three of our segments have been in the green. Turning to the production statistics on slide 14, overall retention remains high with a stable trend in select accounts and other business insurance and a modest decline in commercial or middle market business. The total price change is significantly better than the prior year quarter, while versus last quarter Select was up slightly and Commercial Accounts and Other Business Insurance were down slightly. We believe that these results continue to demonstrate successful execution on our competitive advantages and capabilities in the marketplace. The next page takes the renewal premium change data and splits it into its two primary components, pure rate and exposure change. Across all of business insurance and in each of these individual businesses rate is positive. As we just talked about, overall exposure is declining as a result of the economic environment, so total price change is a slight negative. Select Accounts is still getting positive exposure change in its renewal premium. This is primarily a result of higher insured values on commercial properties. So in Business Insurance, we have now been talking for three consecutive quarters about the positive rate change, and we are well aware that this is somewhat inconsistent with the broader marketplace view of pricing. On the next slide, we took the rate change in Business Insurance and showed it in total and by our five major product lines. While the degree of this change varies for each line of business due to both the initial profitability and market conditions, it is important to note that our composite positive change is not being disproportionately driven by one or two lines of business and as a result, we believe the improvement is more sustainable. So we continue to be encouraged that we are getting rate improvement in our commercial business and to give you some further insight into our mood as we head into 2010, slide 17 shows our preliminary look at the rate change within commercial accounts for the month of January. I want to point out that I am just talking about commercial accounts that other business units may not be as positive and we never want to overemphasize the importance of one month\u2019s results, but given that January is the largest month of the year for commercial accounts, we felt that our ability to continue to get positive rate here was particularly noteworthy. Recognize that these statistics are not fully developed and are subject to change, but we do believe they demonstrate the sustainability of our competitive advantages in the market. 2009, new business results shown on the next page or up 2% quarter-over-quarter, in Select Accounts, we have less new business for this period. This is a direct result of our conscious decision to get some rate in those products, where it is needed and increased competition within the large end of the Select business. The Select Express product, which is our no touch insurance solution for small business customers, continues to produce strong new business results driven by a historically high flow of new business opportunity. We continue to see significant increases in the flow of new opportunities in commercial accounts and other Business Insurance. As we have discussed in the past, we are maintaining our strategic underwriting focus and accordingly, our hit ratios have come down, but we are extremely pleased with the new business results for the quarter, although we continue to see the effects of the economic downturn in a majority of our businesses. We remain very pleased with our effective execution, position in the marketplace and results this quarter and for the full year. We firmly believe that as the economy stabilizes and eventually improves our competitive advantages, our breadth of product, industry leading metrics, point of sale capabilities and leadership position with independent agents will continue to matter and differentiate us in the marketplace resulting in both continued growth and profitability. Moving to the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, slide 19, operating earnings in the quarter were up $40 million driven by favorable prior year development in a number of different businesses and increased net investment income. This was partially offset by losses on a non-renewed professional liability program in Ireland, which resulted in the increase in the adjusted GAAP combined ratio for the quarter. For the full year, the adjusted combined ratio was up just slightly as margins generally continued to hold steady. Net written premiums for the segment, after adjusting for the impact of the changes in foreign exchange rates, were down slightly for the quarter about 1% and the full year of about 2%. The largest driver of the year-over-year change is the impact of the economy on surety volume. Turning to the production statistics on slide seven and starting with surety. For the fourth quarter, we did see quarter-over-quarter growth in the construction surety book of business driven by activity in our large national accounts market within our surety business. However, fewer construction surety opportunities continue to exist in the marketplace and as a result we do not see this quarter\u2019s results representative of a larger macro trend. Given market conditions we continue to feel very good about the top line story in this business, the credit quality of our book of business and our market position going forward. Quarter-over-quarter retention and new business and management liability was down as a result of our underwriting initiatives and continued to focus on getting rate where we need it. Renewal premium change decreased to minus 1%, but the pure rate change was at plus 2%. The rate improvement was offset by other renewal price change at minus 3%. The other RPC was impacted by a combination of interventional underwriting actions and the impact of the economy on exposures. In our international business, retention was down marginally versus the prior year quarter, renewal premium change was slightly positive with underlying rate improvement at 3%. New business is down modestly compared to the prior year quarter as intentional underwriting actions in the United Kingdom and Lloyds were partially offset by continued growth in personal lines products in Ireland. We continue to monitor the analysis on impacts of the financial marketplace disruption on our management liability business, which we have shared with you over the past couple of years and our conclusions remain the same. Our current loss estimates continue to be within our planned expectations. So, overall for the segment our consistent focus on strategic underwriting actions has resulted in some intentional rate and growth variations by product within Financial, Professional & International. We\u2019re very pleased with these results and continue to be encouraged by both our top line performance and underlying profitability within this book of business, particularly in light of the difficult economic conditions. Turning to slide 21 and Personal Insurance, both the auto and property businesses continued to perform well given the current economic environment. Full year operating earnings were up 29% year-over-year driven by lower catastrophe weather related losses in the current year. While we did not encounter an event the size of Hurricane Ike in the current year, we did have catastrophe losses that were consistent with our 2009 expectations. Additionally, non-catastrophe weather was active throughout the year and marginally exceeded our expectations. Moving to the quarter, operating earnings are down slightly from the same period last year due to less prior year favorable development and a reduction to Hurricane Ike\u2019s estimate in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the late development of auto claims at year end 2008. Agency net written premiums, which exclude any premiums attributable to our recently announced direct-to-consumer initiative, are up 2% compared to the prior year, byline automobile premiums are down 1% due to lower policy growth, which we attribute to our pricing discipline, and property premiums are up 6% compared to the prior year resulting from strong renewal pricing and new business growth. Looking at slide 22, Agency Auto\u2019s combined ratio of 100.9% was higher than fourth quarter 2008 primarily due to the timing of 2008 weather related losses. Specifically, during the last few weeks of \u201808, we experienced heavy weather activity and those losses developed into early 2009. If we strip out this noise and take into consideration the expected fourth-quarter seasonality, we believe our auto product is achieving margin improvement due to our local and disciplined rate actions more than offsetting current loss trends. Agency Property\u2019s combined ratio when adjusted for cats was 76.6%, two points higher than the fourth quarter 2008. Like the rest of the industry, we are seeing some loss cost pressures on our property book primarily driven by the year-over-year increases in the cost of labor and materials associated with weather related losses. Turning to slide 23, we continue to be pleased with our Agency Auto production results, especially in light of current market conditions. While policies in force are down, retention is flat compared to prior year quarter with continued positive renewal premium change. Overall we feel good about our new business production as we see the decline we experienced in previous quarters flattening out. We remain pleased with our Agency Property production results for this quarter. In spite of the difficult housing market all of our production metrics improved compared to the same prior year period, retention, renewal premium change and PIF growth remains at two year highs and new business is up 20% compared to the same quarter last year. It\u2019s also important to note that we have achieved these production results with a combined ratio that is significantly below the industry average. So overall a great quarter, record net earnings and earnings per diluted share and given the economic environment, solid top line performance, but we believe that these results are less about the near term economic or insurance marketplace conditions and more about the long term capabilities and competitive advantages we\u2019ve built. These capabilities are sustainable and we will continue to differentiate ourselves to our independent agents, customers and brokers through the products and services we provide. So we feel great about the short term, but we are just as bullish about our long term position in our marketplace. Now let me turn it back to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Brian. Pages 24 and 25 set forth our guidance for 2010 along with certain supporting information. We\u2019re projecting fully diluted operating income per share in the range of $5.20 to $5.55, which in round numbers should translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 11%. Our guidance assumes cat losses of $390 million after tax or $0.80 per diluted share, an increase from the guidance provided in prior years due to growth in our homeowners business. No estimates of prior year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable, a low single digit change in average invested assets ex-unrealized gains and losses, share repurchases in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases and employee equity awards in the range of $485 million to $490 million shares. We thank you for listening and now welcome any question you might have.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Cliff Gallant - KBW.\nCliff Gallant - KBW: The first question was about the reserve release for the current accident year 2009. I think you mentioned that was commercial auto severity. I\u2019d like to hear a little bit more about what exactly you saw that gave you the confidence release so early and I guess, how should I think about how that will impact your ability to release reserves in calendar year 2010? My second question was just sort of a bigger picture. You talked a little bit in your prepared remarks about the drag from the economy and that if we had bottomed you expected to see maybe start to see signs mid-year. Can you talk a little bit about what that drag is how much of a lag effect do you expect the property casualty industry to see between the economy bottoming and seeing a rebound for the industry?\nBrian MacLean: Okay, this is Brian. Let me take a shot at that and then, on the first point it was both the commercial auto liability piece and frequency really across the commercial book. Pretty much in most of our commercial products we\u2019re seeing, and continue to see, favorable frequency trends. We obviously watch those every quarter and try to bake into our current loss picks our best estimate of where those are going, but throughout 2009 those continue to develop favorably and so we did make an adjustment for that in the fourth quarter as well as the auto liability piece, which we\u2019ve just been seeing some good results in. So those are the pieces.\nJay Fishman: What occurred in 2009 really will bear no impact in the context of reserve development for 2010. This was a re-estimation of current year losses and is not actually an adjustment to prior period development at all. On the second question of exposure Brian and I will tag team this a little bit. First, there is a settle but unmeasurable dynamic that occurs, which is the amount of new business that we would do, or any insurer does, is actually already exposure adjusted from previous periods. If a new business account had a payroll of $1 million three years ago it would have driven workers comp premium of X; if that payroll is now down to $900,000 it will be 90% of X. So there\u2019s an unmeasurable, because obviously we didn\u2019t have the account previously, an unmeasurable element of new business that is already reflecting the drag in the economy. Then there\u2019s the second and very quantifiable and measurable dynamic of auto premium adjustments and exposure drops and Brian, why don\u2019t you speak to that?\nBrian MacLean: Yes and so, as I was trying to say in the comments, and as many of, we audit our commercial business. We write the business on a given day and then in that there is an assumption of what the exposure is going to be, whether that\u2019s payroll or receipts or whatever and at the end of the policy we audit that and adjust the premium charge accordingly. In the vast majority of times that\u2019s usually a significant positive number, fairly significant as in can be 3% to 5% overtime and in this environment that\u2019s really closer to zero. One of the settle dynamics when you start thinking of going forward into 2010 is that right now in the fourth quarter of \u201809 we were auditing accounts that we had written in fourth quarter of \u201808 and obviously first quarter we\u2019ll be doing the first quarter of \u201809. So the economy was bottoming much more than we had expected when we wrote this business, so you\u2019d expect the audit premium to be down dramatically.\nJay Fishman: It certainly much more than the accounts themselves expected as well. These are all factors that are estimated at the time the premium is established and the change in the economy was I think more dramatic than many of our accounts expected it would be.\nBrian MacLean: So as the economy rebounds that will help that dynamic and it will obviously help exposures on renewal accounts, but the other thing that\u2019s going on that could actually make it in audit premium rebound much quicker is that you have to think of the business that we wrote last year in the second quarter and the third quarter; our customers have probably had a pretty pessimistic view of what their exposures would be going forward. So this is really measuring how much the economy has recovered versus their expectations and that could actually be a little bit better than expected. So, we\u2019ll watch it throughout 2010 and see where it goes.\nJay Fishman: So to answer, I wanted to good question, there will be a lag, but it will be interesting to watch the extent to which the accounts anticipated deterioration of the economy and either it will continue at a similar pace or begin to bottom out. It\u2019s very difficult for us to really assess that at the moment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Meredith - UBS.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: A couple questions here for you. First, could you talk about loss cost trends, what\u2019s happening with loss cost trends in the commercial lines of business and specifically if you\u2019re getting these rate changes you\u2019re seeing right now, it should we expect your combined ratios here in 2010 to flatten out or even start going down?\nJay Fishman: Well, first, I\u2019d say generally speaking that the trends that we have been seeing for a while now certainly I think all of 2009. We\u2019ve characterized them generally as been \u201809; it\u2019s still the case there really hasn\u2019t been any significant change in any of the loss dynamics in any serious way and obviously this is all very predictive and meaning we\u2019re guessing to a great extent, but if you roll out the rate increases that we are at least planning for, hoping for and compare that to the loss trends that we\u2019re expecting, what you would see in the loss and LAE ratio, that component of combined ratio would be modest, really quite modest deterioration. We are not anticipating that that will go down, but what we see at this point and what\u2019s imbedded in our guidance would be a very modest deterioration in the loss and LAE component.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Is that because of the impact of new business?\nBrian MacLean: Not exclusively, Brian. I mean, we obviously look at new business pricing and factor that into our loss ratio assumption.\nJay Fishman: It\u2019s really the gap. It\u2019s driven largely by, again the gap between loss trend and rate gain, and notwithstanding the fact that rate gain is positive.  Now the second part of the question is, is overall loss trend higher or lower than that and the answer if you take the first part of my answer here what really communicates underneath is it that the loss trend is slightly and again we are aggregating everything lots of lines, lots of different businesses, lots of pluses and minuses all over, but in the aggregate loss trend is just slightly outstripping what we anticipate rate gain will be and this is, of course, on an earned basis not on a written basis because you are asking about the P&L for 2010. So we are not talking about written premium, we\u2019re talking about earned premium in the period.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Then the last question, Jay, given the current investment yield environment and obviously your guidance coming out to about 11% ROE, are you satisfied with 11% ROE given where investment yields are? Is it really possible to get a much better return on equity in this environment?\nJay Fishman: Well, it\u2019s sort of the million dollar question, I think. In its simplest form, if someone tells me that, rate will never change from here, loss trend will never change, and investment yields will never change is it possible to get back to a mid-teens return on equity? It\u2019s pretty hard to do it. I\u2019m satisfied that given all of the risks inherent in our business that we\u2019re deploying capital very, very thoughtfully, that we are investing with a great sense of sophistication and with a healthy regard for the fact that there\u2019s still maybe difficult times ahead. We are not of the mindset here from an investment profile that it\u2019s time to step down and change the profile in any serious way. I\u2019m working from memory here, but I was looking at spreads just yesterday and my recollection is that the difference right now between AAA and BBB, in effect, are actually no wider than they were two years ago. That round numbers it was about 111 basis points and that\u2019s about where the spreads existed before the financial crisis emerged. So you\u2019d ask yourself the question of whether redeploying into higher risk assets at this point really, are you being paid for it. Are you being paid for taking that risk? Our assessment is that, you\u2019re not and that we\u2019d rather continue to do what we\u2019re doing. So all things considered I am very pleased with how we\u2019re producing at an 11% return on equity given where we are, but that shouldn\u2019t be read by any investor that becomes our target or that we are satisfied with it. We are hopeful that conditions in the insurance arena or in the investment arena will change and allow us more quickly to get back towards that mid-teens return on equity that we aspire to. Bill, was there anything on the investment front you want to add?\nBill Heyman: I wouldn\u2019t add anything to that except to say that probably what got us this far is realism in accepting some variant of whatever ambient yields are and not trying to reach.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Two questions, the first is on the personal auto business combined ratio, about 100% at this point short tail business. One would suspect that the returns on that business are not terribly acceptable at this point. I\u2019m wondering, what sense of urgency you have to improve those margins?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Jay, first of all we\u2019re looking at our automobile portfolio constantly across all the programs in the quarterly level. The fourth quarter, we do see a seasonality impact on our automobile book based on a predominant amount of our premium being in the Northeast dwell. So we look at the overall full year combined ratio for the automobile business being in\u2026\nJay Fishman: That\u2019s loss seasonality, meaning the fourth quarter; given the weather patterns we experience loss seasonality in the fourth quarter. Sorry, I just wanted to\u2026\nGreg Toczydlowski: No, absolutely. And, Brian MacLean did reference that, we saw that also in 2008, some of that loss development leaked into 2009. So that\u2019s been a pretty constant phenomenon inside the Personal Insurance business, but again, we feel terrific about the margins when we look at a full year basis, and where loss trend is and where our rate position is going forward right now.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Jay, then on a full year basis, which was almost 99, that to you guys is okay at this point?\nGreg Toczydlowski: We are looking to improve that. I think in Brian\u2019s comments, he talked about some of the loss trend in rate level. You can see our RPC for the portfolio running in the 3% range, which is outpacing some of the loss trends, so going forward, again based on what we\u2019re seeing today, we do believe we\u2019ll be expanding that position.\nJay Fishman: Let me clarify a little, because it\u2019s actually a topic that we spent some time yesterday just discussing. First, you know, Jay, that we talk about an acceptable range of returns and that we drive those returns down to individual businesses and individual product lines. What we\u2019d share with you is that personal auto, even at these levels, remains at the bottom of the acceptable return range. So if you\u2019re asking very specifically, is it in the range, is it below? The answer is it\u2019s at the bottom of the acceptable range. We clearly have a focus on driving those returns up and we\u2019re going to do it, as we do everything, where rates need it more than some areas more than others, where our competitive strengths reside and so our goal is to thoughtfully and slowly continue to drive those returns back up more into the center of that acceptable range.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: The second question is on the guidance. I guess if you took 2009, and you made the adjustments, which you highlight on page 25, it looks like at the low end of the 2010 guidance, you\u2019re talking roughly 15% EPS growth, which from what I can see is mostly just share count coming down. What would account for the higher end of the guidance? What would have to happen for you guys to be up in the 550 range?\nJay Benet: I think if you look closely at this, you\u2019ll see that the impact of the share repurchases is very dramatic. So I think in terms of taking a look at the size of some of these items, backing them out of the $6.29 and then using our guidance for what the share counts are in terms of next year versus what they were, I think you\u2019ll see the math just kind of gets you into this range. The difficulty we have is that, in coming up with a range for the years you\u2019ve got various things that are going to impact the overall results. One being what\u2019s the performance of the non-fixed income portfolio, you\u2019ve got weather that\u2019s not cat related that will lead to variations, so at this point in time, we just look at this range as being one that historically fits with the kind of results that we\u2019ve shown and the variations in those results.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: So I guess your initial point was that, the variation in the buyback, the $3.5 billion to $4 billion accounts for at least a decent part of the variation in your EPS forecast as well?\nJay Benet: A piece of that, but I think these other things that when you look at the impact of, again, non-cat related weather, how much we\u2019re going to have as a return associated with the non-fixed income portfolio, these are things that will lead to these kinds of levels of variation.\nJay Fishman: It\u2019s not in the context of a full year out, it\u2019s a $0.35 range and really not particularly wide in the context of the business running from $5.20 to $5.55. So it\u2019s, in all things considered really, a fairly narrow range and experience would suggest that once you exclude favorable reserve development and cat losses and the rest, that the principle variable that is so hard to estimate is investment income. That\u2019s where you can get meaningful differences.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: I was hoping you could broadly address the issues of inflation and interest rate risk on both sides out the balance sheet and then specifically, it will probably be in the 10-K, but if you can give us a sense of what a one percentage point shift in the yield curve on a parallel basis, what would that do to book value?\nJay Fishman: Let me start off, Jay, with just speaking about the insurance side and then I\u2019ll ask Bill to comment about the investments. We actually gave information maybe two quarters ago, perhaps three, on the duration of our liabilities. If you go back, we can certainly provide you another copy of that. One of the things that I think surprised lots of folks is that the duration of our liabilities was actually considerably shorter than most outside people seem to believe. So, as you speak about this obviously, the short tail lines, where inflation is less of a near term concern, and then you\u2019ve got longer tail lines, which is workers comp where we worry about medical inflation and general liability where we worry about tort inflation. Observation would be again that the duration even of those liabilities is actually somewhat shorter than most people believe and again, happy to provide a copy of that to you. Having said that, inflation in and of itself is a really complex issue. You start getting into not just loss trends, but what does it mean for investment yields, what about new money, what about the ability to redeploy out of the investment portfolio. There is no simple answer. It\u2019s certainly a more challenging environment from an insurance perspective than one where loss costs are not subject to that kind of inflation, but we\u2019ll pull back together the information that we had on duration and maybe that will be helpful to you at least in trying to get a sense of what that would mean for us?\nBill Heyman: On the asset side of the balance sheet, we mathematically divide the portfolio into two portfolios, a reserve portfolio which we see with our insurance liability and a surplus portfolio, which is the mathematical remainder and we never want the duration of the surplus portfolio to be under zero, which is a mathematical number it can be. Right now, our duration is on the shorter side and we intend to keep it that way. It\u2019s about four, so just doing the math from horseback, I wouldn\u2019t want to be held to it, but a four duration on a $70 billion portfolio with a 100 basis point move is about $2.8 billion pretax or after tax is maybe $3.00 a share book value and we watch durations pretty carefully to try to balance the interest rate risk with the need for some yield. The one constant through it all is we think it\u2019s more important than ever to have high credit quality.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Then a separate issue, Jay, could you talk about trends in new business pricing, what you\u2019re seeing from a competitive front?\nJay Fishman: I\u2019ll ask Brian to comment more specifically, but I would share with you that while we stay really a turned to the marketplace and obviously there\u2019s more than one marketplace, it\u2019s regional, its product, and its market segment. We\u2019re just not going to comment on any other competitor or what their approach is, but I can certainly have Brian, speak more generally about the pricing for new business in a general context.\nBrian MacLean: I mean broadly speaking in the commercial middle market, because small commercial has got a different dynamic than what\u2019s going on in the middle and large accounts is another world. As we\u2019ve been saying for quite a while, we\u2019ve been doing a lot of things with our franchise and our capabilities that have driven dramatically more flow. So we\u2019ve been able to see a lot, lot more opportunity. The new business and we track very closely, like good companies should, our new business pricing relative to our renewal legacy book and feel that those deltas have remained pretty constant over the last couple of years. Now again, we\u2019re continuing to look at more and more opportunities. So I think we\u2019ve got a selection advantage. Our hit ratios, as we\u2019ve talked about have kind of consistently come down, not dramatically, but gradually. So I think the market probably is getting more competitive. I think in our pricing, we feel very good about where we are and broad statement, but our pricing continues to be inline with what we would want to get the return targets that we hold out.\nJay Fishman: That\u2019s actually, I think the important element. One, it\u2019s measurable. We have the ability. Again, every bit of data in our business is fundamentally fragile and always somewhat flawed because you\u2019re trying to make interpretations to broad amounts of data, but nonetheless, it is measurable, we discuss it and we adjust it. We actually do, we don\u2019t have a price list, but we do speak to field folks all the time and ask them to either become more aggressive or less aggressive, it varies by region and it varies even down to the product. This is not seat-of-the-pants management, its management by the number and by the data and there have been times in 2009, where we approached the market more aggressively and there have been times where we approached it less aggressively and if one were to see the data you would actually see the differences. It is measurable and it is adjustable. We\u2019re always trying to push it as hard as we can, not so hard as to find ourselves taking on business at pricing that we don\u2019t think can get us to acceptable target levels, but pushing always as hard as we can to get in effect to the edge and that\u2019s an expression that we use internally all the time.\nBrian MacLean: The other thing we do in a very disciplined fashion is we look at the actual performance of the new business we write over the next couple of years and we continue to feel good about those metrics. So the marketplace, again more competitive, I would say, yes. I think we\u2019ve got the benefit of being able to look at more and more opportunities.\nJay Fishman: Jay, while we were answering your other questions, we were able to get the duration information that we had put out previously. Jay\u2019s got it here.\nJay Benet: In the third quarter discussion, we had indicated that for the long tail lines, workers comp and liability, the duration in comp was approximately seven years and liability was approximately six years.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: How much of the overall book would you say long tail versus short tail roughly?\nJay Fishman: We did that too. If you give us a chance to go back and look, we\u2019ve done that also. I don\u2019t want to just say the number off the cuff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: I guess the first question I have and I know its early days, is in the direct segment. Can you talk a little bit about, what the split is auto versus home? I would presume all autos, but I just wanted to make sure.\nJay Fishman: No, it\u2019s actually not all auto. As we talk about direct to consumer, we also include the direct mail business that we\u2019ve been doing for sometime that gets included in that number and even from the solicitation, the advertising that we do for auto, there\u2019s a serious effort in many of these cases to cross sell into home as well and that has been effective. I don\u2019t know generally, do have a sense on a new business basis of what the split is?\nGreg Toczydlowski: It\u2019s more auto than property, but as Jay indicated, that market has a heavy preponderance. We\u2019re looking for tenant insurance or we\u2019re using the same product portfolio that we are for the agency business. So we have it all available for that particular channel, but it usually starts with an auto, but certainly not only auto.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: Then I just had a question on workers comp broadly. That\u2019s been a line that some people have worried about. It actually seems to have been performing pretty well. Could you talk a little bit about your appetite in the business today and kind of where you might be growing versus contracting? This is normalizing for the economy, which I recognize is a headwind.\nBrian MacLean: I mean, first of all and I\u2019ll flip this to John Albano. I mean, we talk about local focus in all of our products, but comp is a state-by-state gain. It can be very attractive in one state and very unattractive in another. So our strategy is very geared at that. Broadly speaking, frequency trends have been very, very positive. John, why don\u2019t you talk about that?\nJohn Albano: Matthew, this is John Albano. One of the advantages we have in workers compensation is that we have a fairly large workers comp servicing operation that really has been very, very helpful in terms of helping us drive down loss cost for our insures, which is also helpful for us on guaranteed cost business.\nJay Fishman: Matthew, that\u2019s predominately our National Accounts business. A meaningful portion of our National Accounts business is workers comp servicing business, where we\u2019re not at risk, where we get paid, we\u2019re not an insurance risk, but we get paid a fee for managing typically large clients\u2019 workers comp exposures on their behalf.\nJohn Albano: So the things that we do from a claim perspective, the things that we do from a risk control perspective, we are very, very proud of and feel that that\u2019s a real competitive advantage. It helps us in that business, but like I said, it also helps us in the guaranteed cost business. If you look at our growth by line, we have been growing in workers compensation. If you look at the rate chart that we had in there, we\u2019re getting positive rate in the workers comp line. As Brian said, we look at it very carefully by state and we\u2019ll look at rate adequacy by state on a very regular basis, but broadly speaking we feel very positive about our workers comp results.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: Could you maybe throw out a state or two where you\u2019re cautious, a state or two where you are optimistic?\nJohn Albano: From a competitive perspective, I would really prefer not to.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan: Then let me ask the question a different way, because I\u2019m just thinking about it as I look at statutory data for the year end. Recognizing that premium will be affected by exposures this year. Are there any states that you would point out that where you think maybe the premium isn\u2019t necessarily indicative of your absolute appetite, but more the economy?\nJohn Albano: The economy impacts us pretty differently by territory and by industry. So you look at the construction industry, for example, or the trucking industry and you see more volatile swings in terms of exposure in those classes of business. So we look at it in a pretty granular way, some of it is by geography; I would suggest to you that there\u2019s also at least an equally strong component that impacts us by industry as well and we look at both, but again, for competitive reasons I\u2019d rather not get into the detail of what we see there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Johnson - Citadel.\nDan Johnson - Citadel: Most have been answered, but maybe I can squeeze in two quick ones here. On the agency auto business, can we just talk a little bit more about the rate actions that are being taken? It would be helpful if you could sort of tell us, where you\u2019re targeting that business to eventually be on a combined ratio basis? Then I\u2019ve got one follow-up.\nJay Fishman: I\u2019ll answer the latter half and I\u2019ll look to someone else to talk about the rate actions, again recognizing that the competitive dynamic here is real important. We\u2019ve talked for a long time that the targeted returns in all of our businesses, each product, run from 13% to 18%, that\u2019s the kind of green zone that we consider where the pricing in the aggregate will ultimately produce individual product returns that will allow us to produce a mid-teens return on equity. We do have that converted to a combined ratio. My recollection and I\u2019m going from recall here rather than the schedule is that at the upper end it was about 100% at today\u2019s investment environment 99.8%, 99.7%, something like that and down at the lower end, do you remember, Greg?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Like 97%, so that\u2019s kind of the old goal range that we try to keep the automobile portfolio at. Again, to address the rate level conversation, obviously we\u2019re regulated at a state level. So we\u2019re constantly looking at the rate action, very locally and very segmented, down to a particular program level. So you see the results here, which are in aggregate of all those local decisions and similar to the combined ratio. So we have a different story across all of the states, but as Jay indicated, we\u2019re definitely more towards the right edge of that goalpost and we\u2019re working pretty aggressively to put that right down the middle. Based on where our rate actions are in aggregate and the loss trend we feel directionally that\u2019s where we\u2019re heading.\nJay Fishman: If they get very focused to individual states where, because you can break down the returns right down to individual states and there are some states where we are not at acceptable levels and our pricing actions get very focused on those particular states.\nDan Johnson - Citadel: Then on my follow-up, I mean the inflationary environment or lack of inflationary environment in loss costs across all of P&C has been an enormous contributor to book value growth for not only you guys, but certainly others. I\u2019d find it helpful if you could maybe point out one or two lines of business where you feel like the loss inflation has been substantially better than one would anticipate and maybe if there are any lines of business where loss inflation hasn\u2019t been as good as had been hoped and if you had any thoughts as to why that would be much appreciated?\nJay Fishman: I think Brian and I\u2019ll kind of duel on this one. First, and I\u2019ll try and answer the question, but I\u2019d make an observation that loss inflation doesn\u2019t exist independent of the other levers that we have in the business. Meaning, rate expectations are set by returns and those rate expectations are going to be driven by the loss inflation as well as the investment returns that are embedded in the business. So they will operate together, so my caution in this is not to somehow come to the conclusion that loss dynamics are independent of any other factor with which we manage the business. First, there\u2019s been a significant reduction in frequency in many lines of business insurance over the last at least four or five years and maybe even longer; and there has been an awful lot written about why that\u2019s the case, all of it speculative. There are lots of people who attribute it to a higher degree of respect for insurance, that individuals and businesses have an appreciation for long standing relationships. There actually does seem to be less for what I\u2019ll call frivolous claims; I don\u2019t mean that in a substantive sense, but less low level claims than we\u2019ve seen before and that trend has been long term and it\u2019s been in effect systemic. I think that has surprised lots of people in the industry and is one of the reasons why as much favorable reserve development as has happened over the last several years has happened, because you make estimates at the beginning of each year not only about what level of frequency you expect, but also severity. The severity can be absolutely right on, but if the frequency is considerably less then you end up in a situation with favorable development and that\u2019s been one of the reasons why the development has been as significant as it\u2019s been. Brian, you\u2019ve got a view about individual lines?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, I mean a couple of specific things. Again, we talk about loss inflation, remember a lot of it is not tied to core inflation rates. Tort environment has a ton to do with where our losses go in a lot of our businesses and it\u2019s well documented that that\u2019s been a pretty favorable dynamic over a number of years now. So that\u2019s been driving through the liability lines. Medical inflation, which is obviously about 50% of the comp world and affects the other liability lines, has been maybe a little better than what we had expected, not dramatically. The other one that I commented on in going through my talk, in the homeowner side of the business and it\u2019s a little counterintuitive given what\u2019s gone on in the economy, but the labor and materials to repair weather related losses has spiked up specifically in the homeowner side, to a lesser degree on the commercial property side and we\u2019re\u2026\nJay Fishman: Recently; we\u2019re talking about a six month phenomenon.\nBrian MacLean: Six to nine months, yes and it\u2019s been talked about elsewhere in the industry and we and other companies are digging at why that is, and some of it is cost of materials and petroleum cost in shingles, etc. The labor dynamic is a little higher to figure out, but we\u2019re working at it. So those that would be an area where it\u2019s moved negatively. I would say the tort environment is probably the biggest positive running through the thing.\nJay Fishman: The decline in frequency would be the other.\nBrian MacLean: Yes, right, yes.\nJay Fishman: There I don\u2019t know that we have any particular insight that\u2019s any better than anyone else\u2019s, it\u2019s not always so clear to us either why it\u2019s happened, but it clearly has.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer.\nMichael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer: Just a couple questions if I could, more of a macro question. All else equal, when you think about capital management and buybacks in particular, what has more of an impact, the direction of the economy or yields, particularly those at the short end of the curve, and just one follow-up, thanks.\nJay Fishman: I mean, they both do, frankly. If we had the ability, I\u2019ve always said, we\u2019re more than happy to grow our business if there are opportunities to add volumes and do so with pricing that\u2019s attractive. If we grow our business organically, we\u2019re going to need capital to support it and we\u2019ll retain that capital to do so. So that\u2019s clearly, that\u2019s what we do. So first and foremost, as we have the ability to write more insurance at attractive pricing we sure would do it. The dynamic of what investment yields are for capital that we retain is also a very important phenomenon. At the margin, a dollar retained is going to get invested in our portfolio at relatively in the context of historically speaking, at relatively low yields and frankly, we\u2019re happy to return the capital to investors to let them, if they\u2019ve got a different view of the world in the investment arena, let them make that decision. If yields were too suddenly and for some reason spike and spike dramatically, it would become a more interesting decision about what level of capital should be retained and invested and what level we purchase shares. We are all owners, by the way, every level, everybody in management here, of a significant stake in the company. We think about it from that perspective, which is as an owner what would be the right thing to do. So those are both important factors. I don\u2019t know how to rank them.\nMichael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer: I know absolute yields get a lot of attention, particularly in the disclosures, but what do you think about more? Do you think more yields or do you think more about absolute spreads and is there a difference as you\u2019re kind of looking at it?\nBill Heyman: There always is a difference. We think about yield, given the cash flow of the business, we\u2019re not really traders of big income securities. Most securities we buy, especially in the municipal portfolio, we expect to hold literally until maturity, which in some cases can be decades. So we\u2019re looking for an absolute number, which compensates us for all the risks, which may occur over a pretty long period of time. As Jay said, right now those numbers are on the skinny side and we find things but we have to search carefully.\nJay Fishman: By the way just as an add-on, Bill reminds me all the time, even though you maybe talking about at different times over the past year spreads widening. The widening off historically very low treasuries and so you can get confused sometimes and think that you\u2019re actually making really smart investment decisions where from a yield perspective you\u2019re actually not. So we do think that very simplistic way.\nOperator: Your final question comes from Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners: I didn\u2019t hear anything about the direct effort. I was wondering if you had any thoughts of how well that\u2019s going.\nJay Fishman: Not very much to say, it\u2019s coming, I\u2019d ask you if you\u2019ve called and gotten a quote. We run our ads, we get people responding, we\u2019re booking business, and we\u2019re losing money as we thought we would lose money. This is a very long term effort and we have a lot to learn. We\u2019re getting up to speed, we\u2019re learning as we go, but there really is nothing new to report.\nOperator: We\u2019ll now turn the conference back to Ms. Nawi, for concluding remarks. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you all for joining us today. I know there were a few others in the queue. You can please give either myself or Andy Hersom a call and hopefully we\u2019ll answer all your questions. Thanks again. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you.

Thank you, and let me pass it to Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabi. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re pleased to be with you this morning reporting another strong quarter. In addition to posting operating income of $914 million and an operating return on equity in excess of 14%, based upon our confidence in our underlying operations, we\u2019ve increased our regular quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.33 a share. We repurchased $1 billion of our own stock in the third quarter.  We raised our estimate for fourth quarter repurchases to $1.5 billion and our Board authorized an additional $6 billion for our share repurchase program. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute our strategy of generating solid current returns and returning excess capital to shareholders.  Since the middle of 2006 when we commenced our share buyback program, we\u2019ve repurchased nearly $8 billion of our own shares at an overall average cost of $48.67. The $8 billion represents approximately 27% of the market capitalization of the company when we commenced the program. As we\u2019ve indicated before, this is not tactical, but rather strategic. We continue to leverage our competitive advantages to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate top tier earnings, and return excess capital to our shareholders.  A lot of good things happened this quarter, evidenced by strong underwriting results as well as much improved investment performance. On the underwriting side, results continue to be quite solid and benefited from net favorable reserve development in excess of $200 million after tax, even after completing our annual asbestos review. In our ongoing businesses, loss costs remain quite benign and the third quarter also benefited from a re-estimation of 2009 loss estimates to lower levels. On the investment front, our long term fixed income portfolio continued to produce consistent returns. On the short term front, investment yields remain quite negligible and this continues to impact investment income in our short term investment pool which at the end of the quarter stood at $6.6 billion. The pool right now may be somewhat larger than it needs to be and we will look at that carefully but in any event, there\u2019s not much we can do about the low yields. We do view it as an income opportunity when short rates increased to more normal historical levels. In the alternative investments arena, hedge funds and private equity returned to levels more consistent with long term historical performance although our real estate investment income continued to be challenged by the current environment. Given all that\u2019s gone on over the past two years, we\u2019re quite pleased with our results.  From a revenue perspective, net written premiums declined 3% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to reduced exposures from existing customers, largely attributable to declining economic activity in recent quarters. A simple example of this is workers compensation, in that as unemployment rises and payrolls decline, premiums drop accordingly. Overall we have been successful in offsetting the impact on net written premiums on some of our exposure decline with renewal rate gains, solid retention, and new business. In that regard, renewal rate gains were positive in each of our business segments and our strategy remains to seek rate where needed so that the pricing of our product reflects our long term return expectations. Institutionally, however, as we have said all along, we remain cautious about the magnitude of future rate gains that are achievable given general economic conditions. Nonetheless, solid retention and new business levels continue to demonstrate our strong position in the market and we\u2019re going to continue to deal with this market one quarter at a time. In response to a question last quarter, we had indicated that if rate gains remained on pace and loss trends remained generally the same, we believed we would be able to reach a point in business insurance by the end of this year where premiums on a written basis could be in an improving margin position. In fact, the rate gains we did achieve in business insurance were down a little from the previous pace as you can see by the small change in the slope of the line on Page 8 of the webcast. As a consequence, we are not likely to achieve the margin crossover point by the end of this year. It\u2019s been some time since we\u2019ve spoken about cost efficiency but with a specific example we want to demonstrate that we\u2019ve not forgotten this important element of managing a business. We shared with you before the remarkable success we\u2019re having with Travelers Express, our new small commercial business platform. The platform is doing what we hoped it would do. Submissions are up, quotes are up, and new business is up year-over-year.  An important element of the program is the increased automation that it has brought to independent agents\u2019 desks, resulting in much faster turnaround times and much less human intervention. As a result of the success of the platform, we are now consolidating our small commercial underwriting centers from 36 to 12, allowing us to reduce the number of underwriters we need to staff those centers.  At the same time, we are increasing our select sales organization by nearly 50 individuals to make sure that our technology platform is front and center in our agents\u2019 offices. This will result in lower costs positioned against increased revenue and greater efficiency. We estimate that these changes will result in annual savings in excess of $9 million per year. While this is not on its own a blockbuster cost action, you should know that this is representative of the way we think about things day in and day out. In closing, we feel very good about what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish in this extended period of financial turmoil and marketplace disruption and we believe that our results over this period of time have been quite impressive. Furthermore, the results are a function of our culture, which consist of the best evaluators of risk and return in both our underwriting and investment operations that we possibly can be, no matter what the market conditions are. So far, so good. With that, let me turn it over to Jay. \nJay Benet: Thanks, Jay. Turning to Page 4, while capital leverage and liquidity measures were once again at or better than target, withholding company liquidity at $2.6 billion were more than twice its target, this after $1 billion of share repurchases and $166 million of common dividends in the quarter. Our book value per share of $51.24 increased 18% year-to-date with a little more than half of this increase coming from a very sizable change in net unrealized gains and losses which ended the quarter in a pretax gain position of $3.4 billion. These net unrealized investment gains are the primary reason that our investment portfolio increased over $76 billion as of September 30. We also reported after tax net realized investment gains of $21 million in the quarter, including impairment of only $12 million after tax. The dollar amount of investments for which fair value was continuously less than 80% of amortized cost which was only $374 million at the end of the most recent quarter is now down to only $187 million at the end of the current quarter. Since many investors and analysts are closely monitoring valuations of commercial real estate related investments, we\u2019ve provided an update to our previous disclosures in the appendix to this webcast. Overall our investment portfolio continues to be very high quality and well diversified across industries, investment types, and individual issuers. I\u2019d also like to point out that while not a third quarter transaction, we did sell half of our Verisk holdings, formerly known as [Isell] in connection with their fourth quarter IPO, receiving gross proceeds of $184 million and producing $103 million after tax net realized gain. It will be included in our fourth quarter results. Page 5 provides a comparative analysis of third quarter and year-to-date operating income and GAAP combined ratios. Net favorable prior year reserve development was $202 million after tax in the current quarter, comparable to the prior year quarter, while all three of our business segments once again experienced favorable development as a result of better than expected loss experience, most of the $202 million related to business insurance.  Within BI, reserve development included a $120 million after tax increase to asbestos reserve which was primarily driven by a slight increase in our assumption for projected defense costs related to many policyholders. Overall the company\u2019s assessment of the underlying asbestos environment did not change in any significant way from recent periods. An update to our asbestos reserve disclosures is also included as an appendix to this webcast presentation. The current quarter also benefited from a significant reduction in cap losses which were down to $103 million after tax as compared to $682 million after tax in the third quarter of last year when Hurricanes Ike, Gustav, and Dolly made landfall in the US. Also impacting the current quarter was a $46 million after tax benefit from a re-estimation of current year loss ratios, mostly in BI due to better than expected frequency trends. Our GAAP combined ratios, whether as reported or as adjusted, speak to why we remain quite please with the underlying profitability of our businesses. Net investment income of $616 million after tax is shown on Page 6 was $29 million higher than the prior year quarter. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen quarter-over-quarter growth in NII in almost two years.  The long term fixed income portfolio\u2019s after tax yield was 3.7%, consistent with the prior year quarter, while the short term portfolio yielded only 20 basis points, down from 170 basis points. The non-fixed income portfolio yielded 4.3%, much better than the negative returns we had been experiencing since the third quarter of last year.  The three major contributors to operating return on equity are shown on Page 7 of the webcast. Fixed income NII less interest on corporate debt, what we refer to as the passage of time component, contributed 8.2 points year-to-date, down slightly from recent periods, primarily due to lower short term interest rates. Non fixed income NII, a much smaller contributor operating ROE, contributed a negative 0.6 points and underwriting income contributed 5 points. Consistent with the analysis we provided in the second quarter webcast, year-to-date ROE included a 180 point negative impact from non-fixed income and short term yields. Year-to-date, the non-fixed income portfolio yielded a negative 3.1% after tax rather than a more normal level of positive 7% and the short term rates averaged 30 basis points after tax rather than a more normal level of 2.5%. Nonetheless, cumulatively from January of 2005, we produced an average annual operating ROE of approximately 14.2% consistent with our stated longer term goal of mid-teens ROE.  Before turning the mike over to Brian, I\u2019d like to say a few words about a subject that has become quite topical these days; inflation. We\u2019ve heard a lot of speculation about the impact of inflation on P&C insurers. Particularly on reserve levels for long tail lines of business, such as workers\u2019 comp and liability. You should note that the nominal duration of our reserves for these lines may be less than you think; under 7 years for comp and under 6 years for liability.  You should also note that examining the impact of inflation on the entire company is a very complex exercise, one that we continue to study and refine. While economists seem to indicate that inflation risk is low in the short term, longer term outlooks for inflation remain mixed. So, we will continue to examine the potential impact of inflation on our company, along with action that should be considered.  Now, Brian is going to provide some further insights into our results for the quarter. \nBrian W. MacLean: Jay Fishman gave a broad overview of our market and I will go through the segment\u2019s specific results and I will start with some comments on renewal rates across the company.  As Jay commented, the improvement in the renewal rate environment has been of particular importance and we are pleased that for the second consecutive quarter, all 3 business segments experienced positive rate change. You can see on slide 8 that although none of these shifts are dramatic in any 1 quarter, they are a sign of consistent improvement. This is particularly true in our commercial businesses, where we are at a very different point than we were 16 months ago. Turning to the business insurance segment on Slide 9, operating earnings were up from last year, primarily driven by reduced CAT activity and other favorable loss experience in the current year. Adjusting for catastrophes and prior year developments, the year-to-date combined ratio was 94:5, or 60 basis points higher than last year. This modest margin compression is significantly better than anticipated and reflective of a number of factors, including: better than expected pricing, better than expected loss trend primarily driven by frequency, and lower than normal non-CAT weather charges. Net written premiums are down 5% compared to the prior year. This is a result of the economic contraction, which has led to a decrease in exposures. As our insurance payrolls receipts and general business activity goes down, so does our premiums. These impacts are consistent with our expectations and have been incorporated in our guidance. Given the environment, we are extremely pleased with our top line results.  Turning to the production statistics, on Slide 10, overall retentions remain strong with some modest decline in select accounts and modest improvement in commercial or middle market business. The select retention is being driven by our pricing action, which you can see in the 3% increase in renewal premium levels. In commercial accounts and other business insurance, renewal premium changes were slightly negative, but underlying rate change was, again, positive and higher compared to last quarter. You can see this in the next page, which takes the renewal premium change data and splits it into its two primary components: pure rate and exposure change. Across all of business insurance, rate is continuing to improve, while exposure is declining. With loss costs at or better than expected levels, margins continue to remain attractive. New business results, shown on the next page are up 1% quarter over quarter. In select accounts, we\u2019ve been talking about a flat form rollout and that continues to drive significant new business in the small account side or small business part of this marketplace. In the individually underwritten businesses, which include the upper end of select commercial accounts and other business insurance, we continue to feel great about the flow of new opportunity. But, in general, a little less bullish about market pricing.  We continue to be very pleased with our effective execution and position in the marketplace. Our ability to differentiate ourselves continues to demonstrate itself in our results. Our competitive advantages: breadth of product, industry leading metrics, point-of-sale capabilities, and leadership position with independent agents, has never mattered more. We have tremendous optimism about our opportunities and have strong controls and metrics to ensure we are executing appropriately.  Although we continue to see the impact of the economic downturn in many of our businesses, we remain very pleased with the results this quarter and are well-positioned for the future. Moving to the financial professional and international insurance segments, Slide 13. Operating earnings were up and the combined ratio was down, compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower catastrophe losses and improved large loss experience. Across this segment, margins on a written basis are holding steady. In most of those products where current margins indicate that we need rate, we are getting it.  Net written premiums for the segment after adjusting for the impacted changes and foreign exchange rates, were down slightly in the quarter from the prior year; mainly due to fewer construction surety opportunities in the marketplace and disciplined underwriting in our professional liability book and business.  While we had growth in our Ireland and Lloyd businesses, we feel very good about the top-line story in the segment and let me turn to Slide 14 to go over some production statistics. Here you can see the reduction in surety premiums quarter over quarter, which is a result of decreased economic activity, particularly construction spending and underwriting. We remain a clear market leader in this business and in these more challenging economic times; this has helped us to maintain our excellent profit margins. On the management liability side, the key dynamic continues to be the rate improvement inside renewal premium change. Renewal premium has increased to 3%, but pure rate change at plus 4. And we are particularly pleased about where we are able to get the rate. Rate is up 10% on the financial institutions book and 4% on the professional liability book.  We feel great about these rate improvements, but given the return levels on these products in the general marketplace, the strengthening was needed. The tension is down quarter over quarter in the management liability business but the main driver here is disciplined underwriting to address meeting profitable targets. In our international business retention was down just slightly versus the prior year quarter again primarily a result of disciplined underwriting. Renewal change premium was positive with underlying rate improvement at 3%. New business is up double digits compared to the third quarter last year driven by continued strong growth and personal line product in Ireland. A critical component of this result is our ability to leverage the strength of our franchise and infuse talent and operational best practices from our U.S. personal insurance organization.  We continue to monitor the analysis on impact of the financial marketplace disruption on our management liability business which we've shared with you over the past couple of years and our conclusions remain the same. Our loss estimates continue to be within expectations and are incorporated in our current earnings guidance. Similar to business insurance overall, we\u2019re encouraged by our top line performance in loss costs are at or better than expectations. Particularly in light of the difficult economic conditions we remain very pleased with these results and believe we are in a great position as conditions improve. Turning to Slide 15, in personal insurance both the auto and property businesses continue to demonstrate sound fundamentals and sustained earnings power. Operating earnings are up dramatically from the same quarter last year due to less major CAT activity, that is there were no Atlantic hurricanes. Agency net written premiums which exclude any premiums attributable to our recently announced direct consumer initiative are up 1% compared to the prior year. By line the auto premiums are down 3% due to lower policy growth and retention resulting from our pricing discipline and property premiums are up 5% compared to the prior year due to the continued to the strong price change and new business growth.  Looking at Slide 16, agency auto combined ratio of 97 was consistent with third quarter 2008 with underlying current year favorable frequency trend. Agency properties combined ratio of 89 was 8 points higher than third quarter 2008 when adjusted for cats. It\u2019s important to note that although there was no impact from hurricanes in the current year quarter the aggregate impact of other weather events multiple wind and hail events generated total losses that were normal for the quarter. Additionally, the loss trend within these events was up compared to the prior year due to year over year increases in cost of labor and materials associated with weather related losses.  Turning to Slide 17 we continue to be pleased with our agency auto production results, especially in light of current market conditions. While policies enforce are down retention is essentially flat compared to third quarter 2008 with improved renewal premium change. New business volume has flattened out following 4 quarters of successive declines. Property production results remain strong across all of the metrics. We remain pleased with our ability to increase new business volumes while maintaining our margin advantage despite challenging market conditions.  So an interesting quarter, one could ask why we continue to feel great about our results and prospects going forward when general economic conditions remain difficult and the marketplace disruption which negatively impacted some of our major competitors has lessened. Well look at our results, our top line is down marginally but fundamentally due to contraction in the economy and we believe we are still growing share. Our retentions remain strong. We continue to see rate improvement in all the business segments and our margins are well within target. These are the same general trends we've been seeing over the past several years and we believe these results are less about near term economic or insurance market place conditions and more about the capabilities and advantages we've been building for years. It\u2019s clear to us that customers continue to be concerned with the quality and financial stability of their insurance provider our competitive advantages matter and fundamentally that's what's driving our strong results and bullish attitude.  With that let me turn it back to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks Brian. Given our third quarter performance and its implications for the remainder of the year we\u2019re increasing our guidance for fully diluted operating income per share for full year 2009 to a range $5.30 to $5.50 compared to our previously announced range of $4.80 to $5.05. As indicated on page 18 our guidance assumes fourth quarter cap losses of $83 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share. No additional prior year reserve developments, either favorable or unfavorable. No significant changes in short term interest rates from their extremely low current levels. No significant change in private equity and hedge fund valuations for the remainder of the year as we are assuming unchanged capital market conditions. Lower real estate partnership valuations due to continuing downward trend in commercial real estate values. Fourth quarter share purchases of a $1.5 billion bringing the total assumed for the year to $3.3 billion of share purchases. No significant change in average invested assets, ex unrealized gains and losses, and finally awaited average diluted share count of approximately 570 million.  With that let me turn it back to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Jay, thank you. Before we open it up to questions let me just attempt to preempt one. That is we have no investment in the Gallient Funds and we have no insurance exposure to the Gallient Funds and hopefully that will address a question that a number of you would ask.  With that operator, we will open it up.\nOperator:  (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital. \nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital:  My first question is on capital management with the additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization would Travelers anticipate completing that full authorization in 2010 given the current run rate of share buy backs? \nJay Fishman:  We\u2019re reluctant Jay to make predictions of cash flow or capital needs. The world is volatile, storms come and go. The only observation that I\u2019d make is that we repurchased $8 billion over a 3 year period. We started the program in the middle of \u201806 we\u2019re obviously middle of \u201809 and that included at least 1 bad year in the catastrophe arena. So we\u2019re just going to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing which is to produce our earnings measuring our excess capital and returning it and it will go as long as it needs to go and when we\u2019re done if things are looking good we\u2019ll reauthorize some more.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital:  I\u2019ll come at it another way. Is there an upper boundary that Travelers is comfortable with in terms of debt to capital ratio if its 20% currently?\nJay Fishman: The range that we operate our debt to capital ratio in is we talked about before is a 15% to 25% range. That\u2019s a little more complicated than that because each one of the rating agencies has their own real formula, but the proxy for all of them is about 20%. I\u2019m sorry 15% to 25% and we\u2019ve selected to be in the middle of the range, but we could certainly be comfortable higher but at this point we\u2019re at the 20 and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been for a while.\nJay Benet: Yes but Jay I wouldn\u2019t anticipate us raising our debt to capital ratios for the purpose of buying back shares. We are at a level from an operating perspective that we\u2019re quite comfortable with and that additional debt capacity I think is the way the prudent and thoughtful financial companies manage themselves. So the answer is we would not leverage up the company that extra 5 points which would take to the edge of the rating range for the purpose of repurchasing shares.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital: That\u2019s helpful and then more broadly, could you talk about to what extent we might see some recovery in premium volume as the economy recovers. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, is insurance buying trends more of a midcycle or even late cycle reflection within a recovering economy?\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital: Well I\u2019m not sure, I mean we are very driven by payroll numbers obviously and business receipts and so I haven\u2019t really thought about that one very much Jay and I\u2019d like to think about it some more. My immediate reaction to is that we\u2019re more lagger than a leader but again it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve thought about a great deal. I don\u2019t think we have and want to think about it some more. A number of these things will initially show up in audit premium in ordered adjustments so a company will make an estimate of their payroll or their receipts at the beginning of the policy period and in the event that you end up with meaningfully different economic activity and in fact payrolls changed you can end up with an adjusted reflecting additional premium down the road. Again, my guess would be more of a follower than a leader but we should think about that some more. \nOperator:   (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Michael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer & Co. \nMichael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer & Co.: Could you explain the re-estimation of loss estimates on the 2009 business segment? What I\u2019m basically trying to figure out here is if the re-estimation was frequency driven, was it related to the short tailed lines mostly written at the beginning of the year that you assume will mature before next hurricane season or was it something else?\nJay Fishman: I\u2019ll answer it by first attempting to say how we go about doing this whole thing. We start the year with an estimate of what we think our loss ratios are going to be relative to the premiums we\u2019re going to write for each one of our lines of business and as the year progresses, we evaluate information, whether it\u2019s frequency statistics, severity statistics, or pricing and everything else that goes into what comprises a loss ratio and evaluate whether we should be moving off of what we refer to as the initial loss [fic]. As the year progressed, we did see frequency trends in several different areas were much lower than we had expected them to be and we adjusted the loss [fic] accordingly and what happens when you adjust the loss [fic] in the third quarter, you start evaluating is it relating exclusivity to activity that\u2019s taking place in the third quarter or is this information that\u2019s telling you that you need it to look back to the first and second quarter and effectively have a catch up adjustment, so for the purposes of transparency, recognizing these changes in estimate are recurring elements of our business and everybody else\u2019s business. We just want to make sure that we provide you with that information and you see that historically we provide very granular information about prior year development and this is a similar thing but it deals with prior quarters of the current year.\nBrian W. MacLean: Mike, this is Brian. It is looking at frequency trends that have emerged over the year but not just on the short tail stuff. Comp was a decent part of this process too, so it\u2019s frequency driven by more across all the lines of business.\nMichael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer & Co.: I guess the comment in the opening about inflation and talking about longer duration lines, I just wanted to understand how you\u2019re reconciling your outlook on inflation with these longer tailed lines if maybe severity is going to potentially be a driver in those longer tailed lines.\nJay Fishman: To back up for a second, I\u2019m not sure that we actually have an outlook on inflation meaning that\u2019s substantively process wise different from anything that we\u2019ve ever done, meaning we always make estimations of loss costs over the lifetime of a block of businesses that are being written, so we think about comp pays and we think about general liability pays this year, we think about it last year, we think about it 10 years ago, and we\u2019re always making estimations of what future claim costs will be and we haven\u2019t changed anything in particular relative to a different focus on inflation than we have before. I just want to make sure that we\u2019re clear on this.  We haven\u2019t changed anything other than to begin to recognize that you all seem to have an interest in talking about inflation and the point that Jay made which I think is actually quite consistent with Brian\u2019s comments is that the duration of even our long tail liabilities is shorter than most people tend to think, meaning that there is a significant amount of cash disbursement claim payment that takes place in the very early part of the cycle, the tail of the payment cycle. The tail may be quite long but significant amounts of the payments are done early and so it\u2019s not difficult to get an early read of both frequency and severity even in long tail lines. I hope that\u2019s clear. If it\u2019s not let me know, we\u2019ll try it another way.\nOperator:   (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P. \nPaul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.: I was hoping you could touch on the asbestos charge and the comment that it came from increased defense costs. I\u2019m specifically wondering if that is something that we should be looking at beyond asbestos and I have had a couple of companies that have mentioned something along those lines. \nJay Benet: Paul, this is Jay. The way we evaluate asbestos reserves has many different components. Historically you\u2019ve heard us talk about settling large cases, getting them off the books through final settlement, and that process was something that was very big in recent years and has tailed off as we\u2019ve really gotten away from having these large exposures. So what we\u2019re really left with we refer to more as a frequency book if you will. What we try to describe in the disclosures and hopefully it came across is we\u2019re making projections. Those projections are going out over time. If you think about a graph with a sloping line of costs and claims and things of that sort, we\u2019re periodically re-evaluating what the slope of that line is. We\u2019re not seeing any major change in the environment, but what we are seeing is a little higher amount of defense costs on policy holders and our projections over the many years that relate to asbestos, we have to take that into account, it\u2019s not related to any one policy holder or any handful of policy holders. It\u2019s spread out over a big base. So when you apply the base and the increment, we get essentially what you\u2019re seeing here.\nJay Fishman: I\u2019m looking at Doreen to see in fact \u2013 I haven\u2019t heard anything about a perception of increased defense costs around the organization in the rest of our claims. Is there anything that you\u2019re aware of, Doreen?\nDoreen Spadorcia: No. Good morning everybody. Apart from asbestos and what Jay Benet just said, we actually don\u2019t see any increase in defense costs and I\u2019ll give you a couple of different categories that we watch. We watch the ratio between [inaudible] losses and claims and see whether we\u2019re seeing more of those or less of those, so we watch that ratio. The other thing we look at is how many of the cases we can have our staff counsel defend which our in-house lawyers that are licensed around the country and those typically drive a different cost structure as well, and we\u2019ve improved the penetration of those cases going to staff counsel so we actually don\u2019t see that trend at all and see it probably a little bit of the other way.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.: That\u2019s great. And separately, could you maybe comment on some of the excess surplus lines business a lot of your competitors are commenting that companies like Travelers, the big standard carriers, are increasingly entering the excess and surplus lines which I guess would suggest a loosening of terms and conditions and whether or not that\u2019s really the case, obviously whatever your thoughts are on that would be great. \nJohn J. Albano: The answer is no. We\u2019re not seeing indications of terms and conditioning loosening, we\u2019re really not. Nor are we, that I\u2019m aware of in any way, actively engaging in broadening out our profile in the excess and surplus business in any way differently than we had before. I don\u2019t know if you heard that anecdotally from other carriers, but we can tell you from what we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s not so.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.: It\u2019s a question and the excess and surplus guys are complaining about that. It\u2019s tough to tell exactly where it\u2019s coming from.\nOperator:   (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan. \nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JPMorgan: First question I guess would be could you guys quantify the exposure you have to either contractors, installers of drywall, in the southeast? I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s premiums, limits, or even claims notices today, if any?\nJay Fishman: I guess I\u2019ll come at it a couple of different ways. As far as residential contractors in particular, we\u2019re certainly not a big player in the liability lines for residential contractors. If your question specifically is regarding the Chinese drywall situation, we talked about that a little bit on the last call and my recollection is that most of it is going back to what was it, do you remember the dates, Doreen? \nDoreen Spadorcia: Good morning again. We did speak about this. I think it was in response to a question that John answered. There really hasn't been material change to what we spoke about last quarter. We do have some claims but it's a very low volume of claims for Chinese drywall. And just as a reminder, I think John already mentioned we do not have a significant book of business with residential contractors or foreign manufacturers. And those are really the two primary targets. There's been about 700 lawsuits filed around the country. And we have really a very small number of insureds that have been brought into that and they are primarily either importers or property managers, things of that sort. And it's basically - it's like an '06 issue. There's been a lot of restrictions from the consumer protection federal organization since '08. And most of the exposure as we see it when the reports are published like about 60% of the assumptions are in Florida homes. So you start kind of whittling down the time period where the materials were used and who the targets are of the litigations. And really what we're seeing is pretty much what we expected we would see given our book of business.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: And Doreen, and if you're not comfortable because we're doing this very real time, just when you look at the accounts that have had some claim activity, what would you guesstimate the average annual general liability limit to be? I'm not presuming that the [polishes] will respond. But a very natural question is what level of limits could be exposed to those sorts of claims?\nDoreen Spadorcia: They're very consistent with our usual limits, $1 million to $2 million. And the other thing I'd say is there are several home owner claims, but even that they're very, very small numbers. And generally first party contracts do not cover the kind of exposures as well.\nJay Fishman: But we'll always look at every individual claim as we always do. We make no general policy statements. We treat each claim individually as it comes in and we make determinations. So don't read this into a determination of claim handling activity. This is just early insight in information that we have to the issue you're raising.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Exactly. And if any changes occur in prior quarters we'll of course update the information.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: I guess one follow-up with respect to this question is does most of your, with the exposure that you have to contractors be primarily admitted or non-admitted paper?\nJay Fishman:  Most of it would be admitted.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: If I can speak\u2026\nJay Benet: Let me come back for a second because it's important. And typically when we're asked questions we answer with data. This is just so early that it's difficult to do that. But if you go back to a matter of underwriting orientation, the kinds of accounts that over a long period of time we've written versus what we've not written is as you've described it. Residential contractors have not been in that segment of the business that we have had a significant orientation to. It's really been, and I'm doing this to some extent by memory and anecdotally, but it is largely by exception rather than as a class of business that we sought to write.\nJay Fishman: That's correct. And it's really based on some of the concerns that we had in prior years regarding construction defect issues. And so we're not a big player in that market place.\nDoreen Spadorcia: And our claims to date are not generally out of the construction book.\nJay Fishman: That's an important element as well. So more to follow on this and as we have data we think it can be - again, we will attempt to answer this quantitatively to the extent that it arises as an issue and the extent we can we will try to.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: One quick one just on the professional liability book, you made comments in the press release and on the call but how is your posture appetite changing within that market?\nJay Fishman: Well, we certainly have an appetite for the market but we're just finding that mainly because of capacity in the marketplace it's just hard to get rate to offset the trend. So we're really going to focus on profitability and get rate where we can and avoid the exposures where we can.\nMatthew Heimermann- JPMorgan: I guess, I was just curious if there were any classes or industry categories in particular that you're feeling more or less optimistic about.\nJay Fishman: There's definitely some variability among the classes of business but I'd say overall it's a pretty consistent story.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line Jay Cohen - Bank of America.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America: A couple questions - first is on the Verisk transaction you talked about your expected realized gain. Is there also an unrealized gain for the portion that you haven't sold? Does that get marked up as well?\nJay Fishman: Yes, that's exactly right, Jay. In fact, as of 9/30, within the unrealized gain that I mentioned before $3.4 billion, there is an unrealized gain associated with Verisk. And what happens is in the early part of October with the sale we will adjust the unrealized gains accordingly as the markets shows us what the value of Versik is going forward. And to the piece that we sold we gave you the information as to what the realized gain is going to be.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America: And then separately, claims frequency, that continues to be a very positive part of the industry and certainly your story. Do you have any better insights into why we're seeing this continued favorable frequency and do you believe part of it relates to the weak economy?\nBrian W. Maclean: Jay, this is Brian. I mean, and start with broadly, yes, we have insights but we also will readily admit that those insights are far from perfect. So we're constantly trying to figure out as best we can why. Comp frequency, the industry data out there and ours is similar to it. It's very, very favorable. Probably some of that is the economy but probably not exclusively. Auto frequency to us continues to look like all of the economics statistics would lead you to think which is as miles driven goes up then frequency should go up a little, etc. But so those all seem to be in line. But we absolutely don't have perfect insight into why. We have been looking at an extended period of positive for the industry, as in good, frequency trends and we just keep looking at it.\nJay Fishman: And it's predominantly I would say speculation on our part because we can't. There's no way to really prove this. We speculate that part of the comp story is embedded in the economy moving increasingly away from the manufacturing base and increasingly to a service and office space. Those are just things that you, that seem somewhat obvious. But there are so many lines that have been the beneficiary of decreasing frequency. It does seem to be systemic and behavioral. That doesn't mean absolute and comprehensive. That just means that it's a phenomena that is occurring. And all we have, I think, is informed insight rather than a real substantive understanding of why. But there are certainly a behavioral dynamic to it that's been suspended.\nBrian W. Maclean: But with that said, we've been seeing frequency, positive frequency for quite a while. Have the latest economic conditions made that a little more positive? Yes.\nJay Fishman: Positive meaning good.\nBrian W. Maclean: Good, again, good. But we don't think it's just the economic factors. There's a lot of other things going on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Dwell - RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Dwell - RBC Capital Markets: Most of my questions have been answered, but one question just in terms of where you're seeing, you're getting your rate increases. Are you able to differentiate in terms of whether you're seeing that more on property oriented risks or casualty oriented risks? Or is there really no difference?\nJay Fishman: Well, first, we absolutely have the ability to see it in a remarkably granular way, not only down to the individual line of business, the individual account and if you want to aggregate it, the individual office. So we have terrific visibility into it. I think going more granular, providing insight and information that is more granular to all of you is disclosure that goes beyond thoughtful competitive positioning. You're talking about our pricing strategy in the market. We're trying to give you some guide post direction about what's happening but really don't think it's in our shareholders' best interest to be more granular about that disclosure.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith \u2013 Credit Suisse. \nVinay Misquith\u2013 Credit Suisse:  The first question was in capital. I was curious about how much of excess capital you estimate you would have by year end \u201809 after your $1.5 billion dollar share repurchase?\nJay Fishman:  Everybody is looking at me. I\u2019m not sure that we project out and disclose what our excess capital is. What we really do is try to describe a philosophy. And the philosophy has been to start with the operating company capital levels and make sure that relative to the targets we set that those operating companies are at or above target and the profitability of the company that you are seeing in the third quarter and year-to-date is providing capital in those companies that are at or above the target levels. We then look at, as we talked about earlier, taking out of the operating companies what we don\u2019t need, bringing it up to the holding company and having a debt-to-capital ratio that is targeted at the 20%. And then managing our holding company cash to have $1.1 billion of holding company cash, which represents a year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends. And, as you can see, at the end of the third quarter, we are sitting there with, I think, is about $2.6 billion dollars of holding company cash. So at a minimum, you can look at third quarter, and say, \u201cWell, at the holding company cash level relative to the target, we\u2019ve got an extra $1.5 billion.\u201d We\u2019ve already talked about having a $1.5 billion share repurchases in the fourth quarter, but, then, all the dynamics are going to keep working within the company in the terms of profitability and whatever.  I think that\u2019s the best answer I can give you, but overall, you go back to the statement we made that the company remains well capitalized in a great liquidity position and we like where we are and we like the ability to return the excess to the shareholders. \nVinay Misquith\u2013 Credit Suisse:  What I was trying to get at was for next year, would you be able to repurchase more stock than your operating earnings? I guess that was my real question.\nJay Fishman:  As Jay said before, we are not projecting out what, exactly, we are going to do. We will think about that as part of any kind of guidance discussion we have for next year. But I would say it\u2019s premature at this point in time.\nVinay Misquith\u2013 Credit Suisse:  Fair enough. The second question was on the investment portfolio, you had a secure and better [inaudible] portfolio than what appears. Are you now willing to take on more risk, now that the market has stabilized?\nJay Fishman:  We\u2019ve said, in the past, that, and I\u2019ll describe it as on the margin, that we were certainly willing, if we were being appropriately compensated, to take on what you describe as greater risk/greater volatility portfolio. But, fundamentally, it would be on the margin. It wouldn\u2019t be a substantive shift in the strategy of the company. I give enormous credit to Dave Roland, to Damien, and to Bill Hannon, in that there is never an issue. Our investment organization is there to make us an effective insurance company; not the other way around. And so our goal is to take only that level of risk that we need to, to be a successful insurance company. But, even at that, to be paid to take that risk appropriately.  At the point in time we often ask about alternative investments, the fact is that what we consider the quality names in that space, continue to have a capital capacity themselves, uncalled facilities they are still working on. So the fundraising that has been going on in both the hedge fund and private equity areas has actually been quite minimal. And so the opportunity to actually commit additional dollars to the alternative investments, even if we thought we were getting appropriately paid for that, right now just isn\u2019t there. They are not in the fundraising business. Another point, which we watch periodically, you actually take a look at spread between, say broadly, between BBB and AAA. What you\u2019ll actually find right now is that they have tightened considerably. And, from some stuff I was just looking at this morning, you\u2019ve got BBB spreads actually down to about 118 basis points over AAA; coming off of a position of almost 200 basis points as little as 6 to 8 weeks ago.  I know Bill is chomping at the bit, and Bill, I will give you the opportunity. But, that is just not for us at the moment. Go ahead, Bill.\nBill Hannon:  I wouldn\u2019t add much to that, actually. We think in the last 3 or 4 months, risk is once again priced pretty tight. We committed a fair amount to credit in the latter part of last year and that\u2019s worked out. But, right now, we are in a pretty conservative mode, and, if anything, we are increasing the credit quality in the portfolio. We have sold marginal names in the last 6 weeks.\nJay Fishman:  And, in fact, on the margin again, shortened the portfolio a little over the last, what Bill, 3 or 4 months?\nBill Hannon:  Yes. Duration has come down from the last quarter. Counting the short term, it\u2019s probably at about 3.7, which is historically low for us and about where we like it to be.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS. \nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS:  Good morning everybody. A couple quick questions for you. First one, on the surety business; you talk about premiums down because of, obviously, construction activity declining, but what do you think that means for potential increase in loss activity over the next 10 to 12 months and are you reserving for any expectations of increased loss activity in that line?\nAlan D. Schnitzer :  The margins on those businesses continue to perform very well and we manage that book and we have managed that book going back several years very carefully. So from a historical perspective, our view of the credit scoring of those businesses is actually at a near all-time high. We feel, right now, it could deteriorate, we\u2019ll see where that goes. But, from a historical perspective our credit outlook is very good. We certainly consider that and we take it into account as we price in reserve.\nBrian W. MacLean :  This is Brian. I mean, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but our surety business, we are more involved with the ongoing operations of our accounts than in any other line of business and we understand your question and appreciate that in segments of the industry there could be concerns as contractors start to stretch and bid on jobs that they maybe normally wouldn\u2019t do. We are really confident that that is not happening in our book and --\nJay Fishman:  And to show you, actually, the level of attention it\u2019s getting, because Alan started, Brian answered, and I\u2019ll chime in a little bit too, here. What people often forget, particularly in a large construction surety business, is that we are dealing with partially collateralized obligations. Meaning, we have an obligation to finish a project, we have an obligation to finish a project that the contractor defaults, but we step in to the remainder of the proceeds that are obligated to the project from the owner. Which, in many cases, are governmental, state authorities, and things of that nature.  And so to Brian\u2019s point, the real core issue, the real core underwriting issue is: How good is the bidding? How aggressive has it become? And we are pretty good at being involved in the bidding process of our primary accounts. And then, being on-scene and on-site to make sure that the project doesn\u2019t get upside down; to make sure that the payments are being made consistent with the project flow; the work is being done appropriately, because our risk stands in if it gets out of kilter; if the remainder of the proceeds can\u2019t provide enough to finish the project. And so it is often misunderstood in the analytical community that somehow we have this enormous, uncollateralized exposure if someone defaults. That\u2019s just not how the business really works.\nJay Benet:  For most of our surety clients, we understand their businesses and their exposures as well as they do. So we\u2019re intimately involved.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS:  Great. Next question, can you give us your view on what you think the M&A environment is going to look like for the P&C industry for the next 12 months, and how does Travelers fit into that?\nJay Fishman:  You probably have as good an insight into that as I do. Obviously, with the government stepping in, in the last 12 months, the way they have done. They have taken what would, I think, have otherwise been a more robust merger and acquisition environment and created lifelines for a number of companies to continue to do business. So again, I\u2019ll come back to this. Our focus is just given what we\u2019ve been able to do and how well we are performing, our focus continues to be what we can do internally. And we\u2019re just going to keep doing this, and that doesn\u2019t mean, as I say all the time, that we don\u2019t look at things and we're not thoughtful about it.  But we're probably the best acquirer in the business. We're certainly the most experienced. And so our view is that we have the skills to be able to do it if opportunities emerge. But on the other hand we also understand that the risk involved in those things is significant and we're always going to measure that risk against its potential return. But I don't know. It's just such a remarkable, unique, one and only environment. I'm just - obviously none of us have seen anything like this so it's very difficult to really understand what the next couple years looks like.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: Wanted to follow up on the retention and select accounts. I understand what you're saying that you've pushed pricing there. But pricing is up in really most of your lines and they're not seeing the same retention impact. So I'm wondering if there's a reason it's making more of a difference in Select. And to be honest, my guess is I would have thought it would have been better in Select just because you have more overlap there with Hartford and I would have thought with their troubles you would have had a lot of nervous agents approach you for book rolls and things like that that would have helped your retention in select. So can you discuss a little bit more why select had more of a retention [inaudible] than the other lines?\nJay Fishman: And there are really two separate issues to be discussed. The first is in Select Express the important element there is that the advent of that platform broadened out our underwriting orientation significantly. I don't have the statistics at hand but before we had select express the concentration of our business and what we referred to internally as the BOBS, businesses, offices, building and stores was significant. And Travelers Express broadened that out by a fair amount. And as a consequence we ended up much as we did in [Quantum]. And I do think of this as a [Quantum] like program. It's a [multivaried] program that's being applied in areas where our own expertise isn't - our own experience, expertise, good experience, not deep or unexperiences in deep. What we're seeing now is the beginning of loss patterns. And so we are getting a whole lot smarter very quickly about in some of these classes where we need price and where we can have price accommodation. And so what you're seeing on the small commercial business is a price-driven behavior based upon underlying data that we now see and can make thoughtful pricing decisions about and the impact that that's having on some renewable accounts in the marketplace. And that's to be expected. There isn't anything that's going on here that one wouldn't anticipate in the roll out of a new multivaried product that expands underwriting appetite orientation beyond historical patterns. So we're expecting it and for those who would ask if that's showing up. I would say predominantly that phenomenon is showing up predominantly in commercial multi peril in our Select Express business and nothing that we wouldn't have anticipated. The other piece of it is in the non - Select actually has two elements. There's the extraordinary flow business that flows into Express, very small accounts, not much touch. And then there's a larger end of small accounts that actually that we refer to as plus. And that business does require more of a union touch. The plus business we find ourselves and always have competing more with regional carriers, local and regional carriers who actually perceive that plus business as the equivalent of their middle market. And as the market has heated up a little bit we've seen some additional price competitiveness in the plus accounts. And as we do everywhere else, we kind of draw the line and we decide where we're going to respond and where we're not. And so the answer, Ian, is in those two elements. One being in Select Express as we drive our pricing strategy to more accurately reflect the pricing experience and one being in plus that perhaps, I'm speculating here, but it's perhaps indicative of a little more aggressive competition in that kind of regional market and middle market business.\nJay Benet: That's absolutely correct. I guess the only other thing I would add is that while you'll see on Slide 10 the retention in Select moving down by one point, you also see the renewal premium change going up by two points, which is in fact driven in large measure by the pricing dynamic that's going on in the [inaudible] arena. So you can see both sides of the issue right there.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: I guess I\u2019m just looking year-over-year it's down from 82 to 79. Do you feel like we're towards, we're mostly through those two impacts? Or are we maybe in the middle and maybe it can tick down towards the mid 70s before it bottoms out?\nJay Fishman: I'd be reluctant to forecast what the retention would be going forward.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: I guess I meant specifically the impact of the Express reunderwriting. Is that process mostly through?\nJay Fishman: I wouldn't refer to that as reunderwriting. It is clearly not reunderwriting. Actually it is much more about the same thing we do in every one of our businesses which is we get data, we incorporate it into our pricing strategy, we make pricing decisions. We do that every day. The only thing that's a bit different about Select Express, our classes of business that before the introduction of the product we didn't have the kind of in depth cost, loss experience, costing experience that we have in other lines. I don't know. I'd be speculating. We should get the answer and get back. We can have a view on that. It's now impossible. I just haven't thought about that and haven't spoken with Mark or anyone else to have a perspective.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: Just the last part, the Hartford part, you haven't seen the ability or nervous agents asking you to take more business in select because of that?\nJay Benet: I would say broadly. We've talked in the past about how we track wins, losses and how we're doing against our major competition and that is still a very, very positive picture for us. So we're seeing that activity with numerous names and continue to see it. I'd say as the economy has gotten a little less anxiety than it had three to six months ago there's probably a little less anxiety in our marketplace. But there's still a pretty strong concern with wanting to be with really solid carriers and worrying about the alternative.\nJay Fishman: The slides that we showed at investor day in terms of us being in a net gain position with really all of our major competitors\u2026\nAlan D. Schnitzer: This is Alan Schnitzer. I want to clarify a response to the question. It was a question about professional liability. And I just want to clarify that the disclosure in my response was related to a specific book of business within management liability. I wouldn't want to leave anybody with the impression that my comments related to the larger management liability business, for example, the private non-profit business, which is our largest book of business and the management liability business overall it's a much different, much more favorable profitability dynamic. So my comments were narrowly related to the professional liability book.\nGabriella Nawi: Operator?\nOperator: Yes, ma'am? I'm sorry.\nGabriella Nawi: Last question from Larry Greenberg.\nOperator: Mr. Greenberg, your line is open.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: I know it's still very early in the initiative but can you share with us anything new, surprises relative to expectations in the direct to consumer initiative? And then secondly, it's been a little while now since the management change in personal lines and small commercial. Has there been any change in strategy or structure to that operation post that change?\nJay Fishman: Why don't I take the first and you take the second? There's nothing new to report on our director consumer initiative. We are clearly in the earliest of early days. It is an R&D program. As we promised, we continue to lose money on the program. That we're being successful in that regard. As reflected obviously in the package that you have, the long-term venture we've\u2026 Anne MacDonald is our new Chief Marketing Officer who is sitting at the end of the table and I'm now just more convinced that we're developing real insights, real perspectives on getting smarter. But there's nothing new in the initiative to report.\nJay Benet: And on the management changes the short answer is that we're still moving along in the same direction as we were before. Greg Toczydlowski has been in PI and was managing a lot of those operations [technical difficulty] insurance group and so strategically, no, we\u2019re just as we always have, we\u2019re constantly tweaking things and looking to imrove what we do, but no, there hasn\u2019t been any fundamental shift in strategy.\nOperator: There are no more questions at this time so I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Nawi for closing remarks. \nGabriella Nawi: Thank you all for joining today and if you have any additional questions, please contact either myself or Andy Hersom in Investor Relations.

And welcome to the Second Quarter Earnings Review for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. As a reminder this call is being recorded today July 30, 2009. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Traveler's discussion of our second quarter 2009 results. Hopefully, all of you seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our web site at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. With me today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of Senior Management are also in the room available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I'd like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts may be forward-looking statements. Specifically our earning's guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statement that accompanies results of operation, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company's reserve and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and it is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligations to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers' operating incomes, which we view as a measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website travelers.com. With that, I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Pages three and four of our webcast summarize our second quarter highlights as further described in our press release. All in bottom-line performance was modestly better than we expected and we are particularly pleased with what we accomplished in written premiums. Brian will have more to say about that a bit later. The reporting today is somewhat later than usual driven simply by the way the calendar work and the fact that we build in a few extra days in our schedule due to the conversion to a new ledger system which we successfully completed in the first quarter. Interestingly, this timing has allowed us to listen to a few other calls and to observe some of the market commentary. It has been a fair amount of discussion about market trends. Is this a hard market, a stealth hard market or continuing soft market, a softly harden market, or is the industry on or off the wagon? Any of you can take your own standby. However we view the conditions, our challenges to execute in the only environment that exists and that's the environment that we face today. What you have heard from us in the past and will hear again today is a very consistent story that the Company is really well positioned to execute across our franchise and to continue to pursue and achieve our financial goals. We are executing, where we see attractive opportunities and where we don't, we pass. Having said that understand that we are seeing many of those opportunities. We've grown our premiums in both business and Personal Insurance at rate and profitability, which our metrics indicate are at levels, with which we continue to be comfortable. You won't know that we are a very quantitatively driven organization and I believe that many respect Travelers have set the standard for understanding its business and operating on a quantitative rather than an anecdotal basis. We're going to share some of that data with you this morning, and I believe you will see thought on this in our approach. Just to refresh everyone's memory, we've been successful driving rate upward generally since the second quarter of last year. That success continues through this quarter as well. In fact, we've been able to achieve positive rate change in each of our three business segments in the quarter. Nonetheless we are reluctant, as we were last quarter to make declarations about what the future holds. While we are really pleased that we've been able to achieve these rate gains over this period, it has struck us at somewhat kind of retulative to believe that one could with certainty forecast rate gains in a recessionary environment. We've refrained from making predictions and focus on executing in the environment that we're in. To some extent we feel a bit like the great philosopher Yogi Berra, who understand once observed that it's really difficult to predict anything particularly if it's in the future. All in the insurance market is much improved from where it was just a year ago. It's been an exciting time not only as a result of our strong competitive positioning but also due to the business that's been in the market place as a result of the disruptions specific to a few individual carriers. We're staying focused, attending to customers and brokers and agents and working hard to grow our business. With that let me turn to returns, the metric that we probably focus on most. For the quarter, we produced an operating return on equity of 11.3%. We might ask how we reconcile this return to our long-term goal of achieving a mid-teens return on equity overtime. Please turn to slide five, and let me share with you an illustrative analysis that demonstrates the impact of current investment yields on our returns. First, given the turmoil on the financial markets over the last year and a half, we made a decision to accumulate cash at our holding company that exceeds our long term target of one times dividends and interest for $1.1 billion. We currently have a total of $3.3 billion of holding company cash, 2.2 billion in excess of our target. Our long term philosophy with respect to capital management has not changed and our current expectation is that we will redeploy the excess cash into our share buyback program over time. That redeployment would serve to lift return on equity by approximately a 100 basis points. Next you all now that short-term yields are virtually at zero right now, compared to a longer term historical yield of perhaps 2.5% after tax. The impact of the shortfall has been to lower operating income by about $25 million per quarter impacting operating return on equity by about 40 basis points. This is driven by the fact that we maintained a short-term liquid investment portfolio of approximately 4 to $5 billion to ensure liquidity in the event of a catastrophic event and prevent us from having to liquidate assets in a period of economic turmoil. Lastly it's worth noting the impact of the reduction in yields on our $4 billion non-fixed income investment portfolio. For the quarter, it produced a negative 2.1% return. A more normal annual yield given the risk profile like that of these assets might be around 7% after tax overtime. This shortfall has the impact of reducing operating income by approximately $100 million per quarter impacting upgrading return on equity by 150 basis points or so. An important observation is that if we don't believe these assets will ultimately yield returns appropriate for the risk. We will ultimately lower our allocations to this asset class and if we saw our allocation to most certain, less volatile fixed income securities, which even now yield around 3 to 3.25% after tax. The total impact of these last two items as a reduction of returns of approximately 190 basis points. Our premise is that, we will at some point return to by historical standards, a more normal investment environment. The slide is not a projection or a restatement in way of current results. The best way to proceed it is that an illustration of why we believe that a target of mid-teens return on equity overtime remains an achievable goal. We are in a period of unprecedented investment return dislocation and while we have smart and thoughtful about avoiding virtually all of problem areas of investment, the impact of lower yields is having a significant impact on our return on equity. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to make a general comment about returns that are being reported by a number of companies in our industry. As all good companies do, we compare ourselves to the best competitors in the industry and analyze revenues, margins, returns and profitability. What is apparent from this analysis is that not all companies classify income or losses from alternative investments in the same way particularly as it relates to operating income. Before you come to conclusions about relative returns and profitability, we encourage you to make sure that you look at results on a comparable basis. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks Jay. I know this sounds a bit repetitious but I have to say and frankly I'm happy to say that our investment portfolio, our reserves, our capital and our liquidity remain in very good shape. Turning to page six. Operating company capital once again remained at or above all target levels. Our debts saw a capital ratio is at its 20% target. The mid point of our 15 to 25% AA range and that's after successfully placing $500 million of 10 year 5.9% senior notes during the quarter. Holding Company liquidity increased to over 3.3 billion or approximately 3 times our target level and that's even after $750 million of second quarter share repurchases and we got negligible amount of debt maturing. Book value per share $47.29 including 865 million of net unrealized investment gains after tax increased 5% during the quarter. While book value per share of $45.76 ex-FAS 115 increased 4% and we close the quarter with approximately $26 billion of common equity. Our $73.4 billion investment portfolio continues to be a very high quality and well diversified across industries, investment types and individual issuers. The portfolio is pre-tax net unrealized gain increased from 803 million at the end of the first quarter to almost 1.3 billion at the end of second quarter. Fixed income investments compromised 95% of the total investment portfolio although investment grade investment comprised only 2.5% of fixed maturities and the duration was 4.0. I do want to point out one thing that did impact the portfolio this quarter. The downgrading of a bond insure that caused the movement of certain of our bonds from the AAA category mostly to the AA category which was just enough to move the overall quality rating of our fixed income portfolio from AA+ to AA. I should also point out that this change was not the result of weakening credit quality in the underlying bonds. I would also like to mention that during the quarter we adopted two new accountings standards, a FAS 115-2 recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments and FAS 157-4 determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly. Despite the length of these titles, neither impacted us in any significant way. During the second quarter we produced a net realized investment gain of $8 million after tax, including after tax impairments of only 19 million. For those of you wondering second quarter after tax impairments would have been a little more than $30 million higher under the old standards. FAS 115-2 also resulted in a $71 million increase made directly to retained earnings as of April 1, 2009 and offset by a corresponding decrease made directly to accumulated other changes in equity from non-owned resources bypassing the income statement. The information that appears on page 7 is based on the schedule that appears on our Form 10-Q showing unrealized losses on investments, which estimated fair value is less than 80% of amortized cost. This amount has decreased from the first quarter. It now stands at only 374 million, a tiny fraction of both total investment and shareholders equity. We continue to closely monitor these investments as these are the most likely source of future impairments. I do want to point out however, the FAS 115-2 has changed the nature of the data in the table. For example much of the amounts that appear in greater than 6 months but less than 12 months column is the non-credit loss component for these investments amount to a more likely to have been written off already under the old standards. These amounts may or may not be written off in future periods depending upon estimates of future cash flows related to these investments and as a result amount to more likely to age in the schedule than they were under the old standards. Shown on page eight, operating income of 732 million declined 20% from the prior year quarter, this was primarily due to a $170 million tax, I'm sorry $170 million after tax reduction and net favorable prior year reserve development, a $77 million after tax reduction in net investment income. Margin compression that we had anticipated in our plan based up on recent pricing and loss cost trends and higher than expected non-catastrophe related weather all of which were partially offset by a $101 million reduction in Cat losses. Now withstanding the favorable Cat loss comparison though our current quarter Cat loss is well higher than we would have expected. Excluding Cats in that favorable prior year reserve development, our GAAP combined ratio was 94.4% and as Brian will speak to in more detail we remain pleased with the underlying profitability of our business. Second quarter net investment income of 547 million after tax is shown on page nine, down from the prior year quarter, was up from fourth quarter 2008 and first quarter 2009. Tying back to what Jay said earlier in his commentary about ROE, the overall yield of the portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by the very well short term yield environment and negative non-fixed income returns. The long term fixed income portfolios after tax yield was 3.6%, consistent with the prior year quarter while the short term portfolio yielded only 30 basis points, down from 170 basis points. The non-fixed income portfolio recovered somewhat yielding a small negative of 2.1% which is much better than a negative 14.9% and negative11.1% in the two most recent quarters. In consistent with our practice, we updated as best we could our non-fixed income returns through June 30 despite the usual time lag in which investment managers report results. Page 10 of webcast shows the three major contributors to operating return on equity.... interest on corporate debt what we refer to as the passage of time component contributed 8.1 points year-to-date, down slightly from prior years due to lower short term interest rates. Non-fixed income, NII are much smaller contributors to operating ROE but one that varies from period to period contributed a negative 1 point and underwriting income contributed 4.8 points. Cumulatively from January 2005, we produced an average annual ROE of approximately 14.2% which is consistent with our stated long term goal of mid teens ROE. And one final note, we did successfully renew our Cat reinsurance program on July 1 and have included a schedule on the Appendix to this webcast. The amount of National and Northeast only limits remains unchanged as did our $1 billion retention and the various attachment points were essentially unchanged. The cost of the program increased only modestly and with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks Jay. As Gabby said, I will speak to the results of all our business segments. John Albano, Alan Schnitzer, Doreen Spadorcia and Greg Toczydlowski are here with us and will be available to answer questions. Before I go into the individual business unit results, I will provide some broader commentary and I'll start with the rate picture on page 11. We're pleased that we were able to achieve positive rate change in each business segment. Personal Insurance rates have continued on a positive trend for quite sometime. In business insurance, the rate environment has been improving for the last year and turned positive for the first time in over four years. Similarly for Financial, Professional & International insurance, rate turned positive at year-end 2008 following two years of negative trend. The relevance of this trend to our future profitability is obvious. Otherwise in terms of the larger picture claim frequency trends are favorable, in fact negative in some of our businesses and severity is at overall normal levels resulting in improved loss trends. Given these trends, we feel good about our product margins. Although we continued to experience some margin compression on a written basis, it is at lower levels and in some businesses, margins are stable to slightly improving. Despite current economic conditions, our premium trends year-over-year have been stable. Even as individuals in businesses have become more price sensitive, our retention levels remain very strong. New business is robust and overall achieving our targeted rate of return. So all in, we feel great about our position and our results this quarter. Turning specifically to the business insurance segment on slide 12, operating earnings were down from last year primarily driven by the drop in investment income and the anticipated margin compression. Compared to the prior year, Cat activity was down and favorable prior year development continued but not at the same magnitude as last year. Adjusting to these impacts the combined ratio was a solid 95.5. Net written premiums have remained essentially flat for both the quarter and year-to-date period. And as I said, given the overall environment, we're extremely pleased with this result. We are continuing to see the impact of economic contraction in the obvious industries like construction and trucking. But most of our commercial businesses are seeing growth. Turning to the production statistics on slide 13, retention remains strong and renewal premium change is improving and has turned positive in select accounts. But as I already mentioned, the story here is really the rate picture. The next page takes the renewal premium change data and split it into two primary components, pure rate and exposure change. You can see that across all of business insurance, rate is improving while exposure is declining but at a fairly modest rate. So overall, premium change trends are moving in the right direction. New business results shown on the next page have improved significantly this quarter and are up 13% quarter-over-quarter, with strong contributions from each business group. In select accounts, we've been talking about our platform rollout and that continues to drive new business. In the individually underwritten businesses, we continued to see a strong flow of new opportunities and are please that we are winning our share. We've been speaking to you for quite sometime about our competitive advantages, our breadth of product, industry leading metrics, point of sale capabilities and leadership position with independent agents. We believe these advantages matter and are driving the increased opportunities. In fact, what we bring to the market has never been more valuable. We have tremendous optimism about our opportunities and have strong controls in metrics to ensure we are executing appropriately. With that's spent -- said, we spend a lot of time analyzing the quality of the new business we put on the books and are comfortable because of our analytical capabilities. The illustration on slide 16 is a simple depiction of a product lifecycle which quite frankly could be any insurance product or product from any number of industries. The profitability of a book of new business almost always improves over time as we better understand the book and take appropriate underwriting risk mitigation and pricing actions. I doubt this is a new revelation to any of you. So the question here is not just the profitability today of the business we are putting on the books. But do we have the ability to actively manage the business. Do we have the tools to understand the business and track and measure the impact of the actions we are taking? We believe our metrics and tools, which allow us to analyze the pricing and quality of our new business and renewal business, are as good as anyone of the industry. And we believe we have some of the best coin of sale talent to take this information and make the right decisions in the marketplace. We measure our expected returns on new and renewal business, we measure our pricing at subsequent renewals, we examine the performance of our renewal book by loss ratio band and we do all of this by line, by business, by office. The result is that overall the new business that we are riding is generating positive ROEs and more importantly we believe this pricing is consistent with generating our target ROEs overtime. Then we feel great that we've been able to grow share and we're confident that we know what we're doing. If market conditions change, our approach will change accordingly but right now we're confident about our ability to compete in these market conditions. Moving to Financial, Professional & International insurance segment on slide 17, operating earnings were down from the last year due to less favorable prior year reserve development. Current year margins shown in the adjusted GAAP combined ratio were very strong with the improvement coming primarily from less -- large loss activity in international. Net written premiums for the segment after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates was down slightly resulting from fewer construction surety opportunities. We feel very good about the top-line story in these businesses and so let me turn to slide 18 to go over the recent performance statistics. So you can see the reduction in surety premium which is a direct result of decrease construction spending. We remained the clear market leader in this product and have made a conscious decision to maintain our high quality credit profile. In these more challenging economic times this is like to less business but has allowed us to maintain our excellent profit margins. As I said in discussing our growth in business insurance new business, we know what we are doing. We know when to grow and when not to and the same applies here. We continue to feel good about our position in this market and the opportunity for us that the broader economy improves. On the management liability side, the key dynamic is a great improvement inside the renewal premium change. Renewal premium change is plus 1% but the rate change is plus four. Rate under management liability components of financial institutions is up over 10% and public company liability rates are up 4% which compares to down double and double digits of a year ago. That we feel great about these rate improvements but want to emphasize that given the return levels on these products in the general market place some strengthening is needed. In our international business retention was down versus the prior year quarter as a result of a planned reduction in Cat exposure within the life book of business. Renewal premiums were positive, was underlying rate improvement at 5%. New business in the second quarter last year included $50 million from our entry into new businesses in Lloyd. Excluding this impact and the changes in foreign exchange rates, new business was up double digits from last year. Before I go to Personal Insurance let me take a minute to update you on the impacts of the financial marketplace disruptions on our management liability business. We continue to monitor the analysis that we have shared with you during a last 18 months and our conclusion to remain the same. To give you some context into what we are seeing in the current economic environment and how we are managing it, we put some data together on slide 19. Year-to-date there has been 64 bank failures compared to 25 in all of 2008. We have management liability exposure to 26 of these institutions, on a total of 32 policies. Each policy on average has about $4 million aggregate limit. Our total net limit exposed to these 64 banks, failed banks is approximately $100 million and obviously we expect actual losses to be a fraction of that amount. Importantly we had taken actions through our active ongoing risk mitigation and review program and 70% of these accounts before the bank failure. And these actions will significantly mitigate are open in exposure. So again we go over this material not to give you a complete picture of the financial crisis impact but to illustrate through this the use of this binate, how we are confident in our ability to manage the emerging challenges. Our lost estimate and current earnings guidance incorporate this analysis. In aggregate for Financial, Professional & International insurance we feel great about this quarter's results. Margins are solid; we are growing where we want to and we are in a great position as conditions improve. Moving to Personal Insurance, we made one change to the exhibit. All of the written premium and production results shown -- depict our agency book of business which is defined as business sold through agents, brokers and other intermediaries, or said another way excludes our recently announced director-to-consumer initiative. Turning to slide 20 in Personal Insurance. Excluding the impact of mother nature, both auto and property business continues to demonstrate sound fundamentals and substantial earnings power. Weather did impact operating earnings which were down from the same quarter last year. You can see that the large cat experience was favorable but non-cat weather related losses in home loans as were significantly higher. Looking at slide 21, agency autos combined ratio of 96% was of slight improvement from second quarter 2008 due to a slight improvement in both frequency and earned rate. Agency properties combined ratio of 99% was three points higher than second quarter 2008 driven by the non-Cat weather I mentioned. Turning to slide 22, we continue to be pleased with our agency auto production results especially in light of current market condition. Renewal premium change has increased to 5% this quarter, which has contributed to a slight drop in retention and marginal pip reduction versus second quarter 2008. Agency property production results remain strong across all the metrics and we remain pleased with the continuing growth of the Quantum Home product and its ability to increase new business volumes despite challenging market conditions. Across all our business segments, we are continuing to monitor loss trends, profitability in marketplace conditions, as well as the changing economic climate. So we remain very pleased with new business growth and its underlying performance. We have been and will continue to take rig with loss indications and market dynamics allow us. We are continuing -- consciously expand product offerings and better align our field point of sale capabilities. In summary while we cannot predict where the economy and the market will go in the second half of the year, we are pleased with this quarters results and look forward to building on that success. Before I turn it back over to Jay Benet, I want to take this opportunity to introduce Greg Toczydlowski and Doreen Spadorcia. Greg has been a key leader in the Personal Insurance organization for 16 years and over that time he's had experience in every area of the business. He led the development and implementation of our Quantum product and built and manage the product group for a number of years. In the last year, his responsibilities were broadened to run the entire agency business on a day-to-day basis in this latest announcement further expenses roll. Doreen Spadorcia has had experience running profit centers, staff and support areas and quite honestly is the best manager of talent that I have every worked with. She currently runs our 13,000 person claim organization and the results there has been phenomenal. So this is a great opportunity to leverage Doreen's leadership talents by having her work with Greg to manage the strategic direction of the business. We are confident they will be a great team and help to continue the impressive success of our Personal Insurance. With that let me turn it back to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks Brian. Page 23 sets forth our guidance for 2009 which were increasing based up on second quarter performance. We're now projecting fully diluted operating income for share in the range $4.80 to $5.05 compared to our previously announced range of $4.55 to $4.95. Our guidance now assumes full year Cat losses of 410 million after tax or $0.73 per diluted share based upon actual Cats for the first half in an unchanged expectation for the second half of the year. No additional prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable, no significant changes in private equity and hedge fund valuations for the remainder of the year as we're assuming unchanged capital market conditions, lower real estate partnership valuations due to a continuing downward trend in commercial real estate values, additional share repurchases of 2.25 billion are bringing the assumed total for the year to $3.0 billion and no significant change in average invested assets ex-FAS 115 and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 565 million shares. With that we would like to open it up for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb: Thanks very much. Jay, can you give us some insight in to what level of success you are having from attracting business away from the stress competitors and may be tie that in to new business growth and business insurance that we saw in the most recent quarter?\nJay Fishman: Sure. Well I -- first, the slide that we presented at the Investor Day conference showed my recollection is six competitors and we were showing accounts taken versus accounts lost and net and all of them were positive and I don't have that slide actually in front of me, but they were meaningfully positive. If we did that slide again for the quarter, it's actually they are all positive and they are actually I believe all somewhat more positive than they were from the slide that we presented at Investor Day. So we continue to have success in the market place not only from those competitors that perhaps are struggling but from the real solid competitors as well. It's we are -- just we are having real success in the market place day in day out. I don't know how to quantify that in a context of written premium in the growth, that's I just I'm done it, frankly but it's so I don't have a comment on that.\nJay Gelb: Okay thanks and I have two separate issues. The first is how long do you think it'll take you to complete the pace of the increased share buyback program and then finally if you could comment on the potential for Chinese drywall losses in construction claims that'll be helpful too?\nJay Fishman: Why don't we have John Albano speak to the drywall and then I'll come back for share buyback.\nJohn Albano: Jay, as far as the drywall is concerned, most of the affected buildings were built or repaired in the 2006 and 2007 timeframe. Imports of the drywall as we began a little bit before that but most of what we're seeing in terms of repairs and new building construction is those two years, so we're talking about a couple years of exposure. Our exposure to Chinese drywall situation would appear to be minimal. We are not a big rider of residential contracts; we are not a big rider of importers of foreign building materials. We have looked at the claim activity, we have looked at our loss our limit of liability for each one of those and we view it as a minimus.\nJay Benet: And I just make an observation and obviously we have done everything one can do to analyze what is an early emerging situation. This is still from a claims and activity perspective quite early and who knows where it will go but what we have attempted to is to understand where the exposure potentially could be analyzed, our commitment to those exposed lines and feel pretty good about it. But we are watching carefully and we'll report on it periodically as quarters emerged.\nJay Fishman: Jay, as far as the pace of the buy back program I think in prior years we've said that we usually will hold back a little bit in the third quarter given that as capsize. But in this particular year given the amount of cash we've build up to the holding company, our desire is go into the market more aggressively than that. So for the purposes of thinking ahead, we're just planning on doing it pretty steadily between now and the end of the year.\nJay Gelb: Consistent with the pace you had in the second quarter?\nJay Fishman: Well I mean in terms of the dollar amounts that we're putting forth in the guidance, it would be at a higher amount than what we did in the second quarter.\nJay Gelb: Thanks for the answers.\nJay Fishman: My pleasure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Citi. Please proceed.\nJoshua Shanker: My first question is whimsical. I'm wondering where the little dog is? I've been waiting for it on TV.\nJay Fishman: You don't watch enough TV. We have spent plenty of money on it and you haven't seen it.\nJoshua Shanker: Alright, alright I'll keep watching. And I'm following up on Jay's first question, one of your very large competitors who I won't name spoke earlier this morning and said that they're seeing great submission flown, winning great business in the small commercial arena. And I'm wondering if there's room for two very large competitors to be doing that and who is loosing the business?\nJay Fishman: Our data speaks for itself. The written premium in select is as presented here. So I don't know anything about anybody else's numbers. I know a lot about our own and if you go to page, where was that the new business page -- go to 15. We did $154 million in Select, up from $133 million last year, premised largely on the roll out of Travelers' Express and the success that that's having in the marketplace. So I don't know about anybody else's numbers but there is plenty of room for us to be successful.\nJoshua Shanker: And the final question, there is lot of people. Where are deductibles going for small commercial business? Is that a common discussion that you're having? Is that actually unusual? What are your agents experiencing in that regard?\nJohn Albano: This is John Albano. There is really little movement in terms of deductibles on smaller accounts. Smaller accounts tend to have lower deductibles obviously than larger accounts and based on their financial condition, not looking to move that up. More broadly, we are seeing in larger accounts a little bit of movement in terms of deductibles on some larger accounts but it's not a significant shift.\nJoshua Shanker: Okay and thanks for the answers.\nJay Fishman: Pleasure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Heimermann with JP Morgan Chase. Please proceed.\nMatthew Heimermann: Hi, good morning everybody. Two questions if I may, just with respect to some of the slight moves down our retention, is this just... how tied, let me rephrase that. How important has that retention drop been to actually being able to generate deposits of rate changes across all those segments.\nBrian MacLean: This is Brian. I think you got a look at it a little bit specifically business-by-business. In Personal Insurance; I think specifically on the auto side, we were ahead of a little bit of the market curve on getting some rate increases filed there. And there's probably also some economic drivers there with consumers being a little more price sensitive. So we feel real good about that trade off and so we needed to get the price moment and so their it's pretty correlated. In the small commercial world, there's probably also a little bit of economic impact there with some business failures. Again, not a dramatic number but maybe that's moving our retention of point. And so we don't think there it's been as connected to the pricing but is to some degree. And in the middle market, the numbers have bounced around a bit but at 85 levels, we continue to feel great about our retention.\nJay Fishman: And again just in the context of looking overtime, the Select retention of 80 is the same as it was in the second quarter of '08. The retention to commercial 85 is the same as that it was in the second quarter of '08 and in other business insurance were from 82 to 81? I -- hard to see anything in those numbers that would indicate any substantial change or shift. Obviously we've always said retention is an important, maybe the most important leading indicator. We'll obviously keep on watching it but this is at the moment nothing more than another quarter that I would characterize as being in sequence.\nMatthew Heimermann: Okay. And based on that, it sounds like you're still pretty comfortable that that trend can continue through the end of the year?\nJay Fishman: Again I'm trying to resist the notion of forecasting because the market is... when is say the market, I'm really responding more globally to the issue of the economic environment in which all companies compete. But we're all competing in the same marketplace and given the recession and given the lower payrolls, lower projected sales, lower amounts of transportation, just lower amounts of economic activity which translates into premiums, it's just an awfully difficult time to look into the next two quarters and predict anything other than just being out there and banging away. And so I'm just going to refrain from it. But I don't see anything in the second quarter where any kind of alarm bells or genuine concerns are there.\nMatthew Heimermann: Okay and then with respect to the tip decline in Personal Lines, on the autos, I believe which was auto driven, is there are any particular type of customer that's driving that retentions range?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Good morning Matt, it's Greg Toczydlowski, as Brian indicated. We are just seeing the economy generate a price sensitive consumer across a pretty broad group of a profile. So we are not seeing any shift in profile overlap business in. Right now our focus is very much on the pricing discipline. So looking at where our combined ratios are for the quarter, we feel good about the combination of the two metrics.\nMatthew Heimermann: Okay. Thank you and then Jay just one quick follow up. Your portfolio acts the bond wraps, is that AA as well?\nJay Fishman: Yeah, it's either way, it's a AA portfolio.\nMatthew Heimermann: Okay perfect, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please proceed.\nJay Cohen: Thanks good morning. Couple of questions. Jay, slide five was an interesting one, where you adjust for the ROE for these, I think reasonable factors. What adjustment you didn't make was the combined ratio and I guess the presumption would be that the combined ratios you guys are producing now is a normalized level and I am wondering if you can reflect on that a bit and then I will have one more question.\nJay Fishman: Yeah we thought much about it because obviously it's an important element. You got a couple of things kicking around in the there, you've got favorable reserve development and it's certainly appropriate to ask the question to the extent of which that is sustainable and you've got excess cat in the quarter relatively to what we would consider to be a normal cat exposure, normal cat loss last for the second quarter. So ultimately what we did was, we ran the same analysis, if you go the slide that shows the combined ratio XX, my recollection is let me get to it but I think it was 94.4 is my recollection for that combined\nJay Cohen: That's right.\nJay Fishman: Ratio was XX and even if one where to ramp that up for what might be considered a normal cat exposure, you get to and these are approximates. Jay I think, I'm not getting terrible precise here but even if you call it a 95 and then if you look at we make the assumption that given what's happening with rate and given what's happened with loss trend, that you can envision the circumstance we're on a inert basis looking out there that margin compression potentially could stop. You'll get to that same mid-teens level. It will a little bit lower obviously 95 versus 94.4 is six-tenths of a point in the other direction but its just arithmetic. And if you are on a 95 combined and assume a more normalized investment return environment. I think it will point you generally in the same direction. But you can ask questions like what happens if rates get much better? It will be better. Will that have an impact on investment returns because the market changes, I don't know. If rate gets really turns down as the different, its funny I was asked the question before, if rates this goes back probably by about 6 or 9 months if rates never change and if investment yields never change, how do you get to mid-teens to turn on equity and the obvious answer is we can't. It's -- there has been a cyclicality to the business and a cyclicality to investment returns and that's frankly why we talk about returns overtime. There is a presumption that theirs a mean line, a normal line within all of those cyclicalities and around that line we think a well run business still has the ability to produce that mid-teens number.\nJay Cohen: Oh that's great. I guess the second one more specific when you discussed some of the bank failures. There was a comment that the company took action ahead of time on some of these accounts and I am wondering what that means? What kind of actions did you take to reduce your risk?\nAlan Schnitzer: Jay, its Alan Schnitzer, it's the typical underwriting action you take any time you will look at underwriting riding an account. So its limits it's A side versus B side. The whole nine yards in terms of underwriting.\nJay Cohen: But obviously you feel that it was effective enough to reduce your risk than what otherwise it would have been.\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure it's changed the risk profile of those accounts.\nJay Cohen: Okay. Let me stop there. Thanks a lot.\nJay Fishman: Pleasure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Nannizzi with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nMichael Nannizzi: Thanks. Just a question on guidance. When you look at the change from before to now, how much of that change is due to second quarter cat reserve development and share re-purchase activity versus how much of that change is due to a change in expectations for the latter part of the year? Thanks.\nJohn Albano: This is J. Albano, I think a lot of it is as we said just the guidance changes based on the performance as things develop. So lots of the change in the guidance was driven by the second quarter. The guidance previously didn't include any estimates of favorable development so that's fully factored in. The excess cat's going the other way of factored in as this the weather that Brian was talking about before. I think if you add up all those numbers and look at the impact of the increase in the share buybacks, and you probably end up with something close to about somewhere between $0.25 and $0.30.\nMichael Nannizzi: Got it okay, thank you.\nOperator: comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed.\nBrian Meredith: Yeah, good morning. Couple of quick questions for you. First your big competitor, I guess reported this morning hasn't his best increase in the reserve. I was wondering if you can give us a status on what you are seeing with respect to investment claim activity?\nJay Fishman: Specialist? [inaudible].\nBrian Meredith: We haven't talked about it a long time.\nJay Fishman: We are we review our specialist reserves on a quarterly basis and we did not make any changes to our specialist reserves in this particular quarter. I can't on comment on what somebody else is saying but at least at this point of time nothing is really changed in our view.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Second question of Jay, just back of the whole ROE discussion quickly. What would you say that the long term kind of fixed income return did you would expect in your businesses, when you are kind of evaluating the -- where rate levels need to be? As obviously you have got to respect in fixed income returns to start trending upwards, right, if you got your mid teens ROE.\nJay Fishman: Yes, different strategic point, the illustration that we put forward here is making two adjustments -- is making an adjustment to short term yields which obviously generate into a portfolio quickly. You've got very short duration short yield change, sort of investment income. The alternative arena actually has a relatively quick responsive rate also. Tight evaluations, equity evaluations and such. Our real fixed income portfolio, we are running a duration of about four and so the change even to the extent that new money rates change, given the share buyback, given the way we are deploying capital, you are not going to see the fixed income investment yield change very much. Its going to continue to just crank out, what it is that crank out. And then obviously as we as the duration moves it will change slowly. We are talking about a 10 year treasury I look at yesterday I didn't look this morning. Ten year treasury at 3.6. This is an investment environment in the fixed arena that will allow us to get through the mid teens on the presumption that short rates eventually return back for an in effect zero and the alternative investment portfolio begins to return consistent with its realistic profile. I feel in fact confident about the first. If we are going to have short rates of zero, we are going to have lot of problems that we are going to be dealing with in a couple years. They are going to be quite different from the ones we are dealing with now. On the alternative investment returns, to the extent that capital where we deployed, again if the ten year treasury is 3.6, if these assets aren't going to get back to an appropriate risk adjusted level over some reasonable period of time, no one is expecting in the next quarter, if they don't get back there we'll eventually cut the allocations to that asset class. And redeployed it somewhere else when the risk adjusted returns are more appropriate. So this is the issue was really at the bell ends of our investment portfolio. The very short end and the alternative investment end and the stuff in the middle is just doing fine.\nBrian Meredith: And I guess the presumption there also is an as you mentioned earlier that to stable reserve development, one has to continue here as well.\nJay Fishman: Well again I think I answered Jay's question earlier about that to the extent that one were to simply assume that there would not be any more reserve development and cats would become normal whatever that means but normal given our exposure. If you want to sit down and do the risk math at 95 combined which is about where you get to a current margins. You will actually see that the analysis holds true even in that case. It doesn't it it's still an achievable goal. So how we feel about it to the extent that rate continues to move up. We feel more bullish about it. We -- to the extent that loss trend continues to remain benign, we feel more bullish about it. So you are right there is any number of variables in this. The extremes at the moment in the context to environment that we operate in and I'm speaking now broadly about insurance and investment, the extremes are at basically zero yields per short term investments and at alternative investments effectively also being zero at the moment. Those were the two extremes. The underwriting environment that we in is just fine, its just fine I mean again its fine in the current quarter and the time in the context of looking at least where rate seem to be heading, I am going to resist for making the predictions but if you look back to the second quarter of last year, rates have been moving in the right direction and loss trend has been relatively benign, that's a pretty good scenario. I have no idea that it will continue. But that -- all the factors that go into how you think about returns in our business.\nBrian Meredith: Great and then last just quickly. Any prospect from agents, with respect to the direct distribution and did that all contribute to the drop in the interest in the quarter, first quarter?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Its, Greg Toczydlowski again. We have been very closely with our agency plan and communicating with them and just educating around all our direct to consumer initiatives and including the advertising around that and the partnership has been very strong and quite frankly as they've seen the campaign out there we received many positive remarks around it. So we are going to continue with that partnership but we don't believe it had any impact on our production.\nJay Fishman: I agree with what Greg said but that's not to say that we haven't taken a call or two or three from agents who are bothered, troubled by the -- what they perceive to be a different strategic direction. But they are clearly significantly in the minority and again I'll reinforce what Greg has said, there are certainly no indication that anything as it relates to our business in any subsequent way in buying and this is attributable to that.\nBrian Meredith: Okay, thank you for the answers.\nJay Fishman: Pleasure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Larry Greenberg with Langen, please proceed.\nLarry Greenberg: Thank you and good morning, Jay I want to ask you to predict what rates are going to do going forward? But if I were to assume that your business insurance rate trends were to continue, would you be at a point by the end of this year, where you weren't loosing any margin on the end premiums?\nJay Fishman: Yeah, we actually have spent a lot of time talking about that exact question and we are going to answer it. We are going to talk about written and then we are talk about both because the 2 things are different but I'll let John tackle that question. No, you want to go. Whatever?\nBrian MacLean: No I think John was just hesitating to say what we -- I think given -- Hi, Larry how you're doing.\nJohn Albano: I think what's important in this is that don't perceive this to be a forecast.\nBrian MacLean: Right.\nJohn Albano: We are not forecasting rate. You actually asked the question the right way which is if rate trends continue which is not to say that we're telling you that rate trends are going continue.\nJay Fishman: If rates trends continue we would believe that by the end of this year on a written basis, our business insurance segment broadly would be experiencing improving margin.\nLarry Greenberg: Great thanks. Second question...\nJay Fishman: It will take a while for that to show up.\nLarry Greenberg: Obviously it takes a while to...Yeah I got that. And on the investment side, has Bill got anymore optimistic on the capital markets environment?\nBill Hannon: Hi Larry, this is Bill.\nLarry Greenberg: Hey Bill.\nBill Hannon: Obviously the psychology is much better although, we don't have lot of attention to psychology what we invest. If we did, we could have invested very differently going into this crisis. On balance, it can hurt if the psychology is better because it will make it marginally easier to refinance the large amount of commercial real estate mortgage debt and private sector debt, largely high yield buy out related that has to be refinanced in the next 24 months. But we still think there will be a considerable shortfall in the amount of debt that has to be refinanced and the capacity of the market to refinance this. And we're determined that as little of that unrefinancible debt as possible be in our portfolio. So at the margin believe it or not, we're probably still reducing risk on a day to day basis. We find there is very little penalty for doing it. In fact in the case of securities, we don't hold any but we hold some that were severely marked down. The recovery in prices has been amazing. Yet in many cases, the same obstacles to ultimate payment remain and that's we focus on. We focus on getting paid because in a fixed income security which have some 95% of the portfolio, you're up side is to collect the cash close you bargain for. And do we feel better, I think we feel better with everybody else but we're looking at things as hard noses we ever have.\nLarry Greenberg: Great thanks. And I think in the past not too long ago, you had indicated that partnership, private equity, type of assets classes might be, some of the more interesting. Have you or are you inclined to put any new money to work in those asset classes.\nBill Hannon: We've given the message to everyone that we're opened for business but there is surprisingly little quality fund raising activity in private equity. Now there is a lot of noise been made about the secondary market and if secondary assets were trading in volume at appropriate discounts, we certainly have the capital for it but we think there's been a lot more smoke than fire there. So it's been a very quiet year.\nJay Fishman: But not lack of willingness on our part.\nBill Hannon: Not lack of willingness on our part and frankly we've been surprised by the low capital falls in our funds. The negative cash flows that is the excess of capital falls and management fees over distributions is running at a much lower rate than we had anticipated.\nLarry Greenberg: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning and thank you for the call. What has shift investments in just a bit, could you describe may be at least qualitatively how within each segment classes as opposed to the allocation you think you're meeting or exceeding sort of industry averages, particular on the hedge front and vividly if you can give us may be an example of how you may be more conservative in your accounting for the hedge funds and if you mention something along those lines in your prepared remarks?\nJay Fishman: Let me speak to the second Paul, then I'm going to turn it over to Bill. We're not more conservative, our alternative investment income or loss is classified within operating income. And so we look at operating income for us, it includes for example the $20 million loss from alternative investments that we recorded in the quarter. I don't know if everybody else does from a conservative or aggressive perspective but many people classify the alternative investment gains income or loss below the operating income line. So operating income comparability from one company to another is really it's easy to do. Virtually everybody gives you the disclosure but the nature of the classification is quite different from one company to another is what we are looking at.\nBill Hannon: With respect to our performance obviously we do comparative to publish bench marks we can find and we try to be pretty granular by type of hedged fund and over the last couple of years we have actually done very well relative to those bench marks. But as a rule what we benchmark here is not performance but risk. We try to keep the amount of risk in the portfolio pretty constant from year-to-year and we grade ourselves at the end of the year by how much return of the return that was possible given that amount of risk we were able to capture. So we do look at the return benchmarks and we are often surprised by how well we do but our primary focus is risk.\nPaul Newsome: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nVinay Misquith: Hi, good morning. Two questions first on the ROE, your slide mentioned a higher amount of cash at the holding company. When do you propose to invest the extra $2 billion in cash because it seems that the $1 billion that you plan you use for share repurchases that you will sort of generate in your net income, over the next two quarters?\nJay Fishman: Our guidance is already speaking to approximately $3 billion of actually not, be very specific it says approximately $3 billion of share repurchases for full year. So we obviously know what we have done for the first six months, so you have some sense of what we are anticipating to do for the last six months through the extent that market conditions and circumstances allow, we obviously have the capacity to do more. If market conditions and circumstances for whatever reason become problematic, we'll always adjust our program relative to what's going on in the market. But I -- we generally been a company that has projected out share repurchases in a way were that our tilt if you will is to probably do more than less assuming that the market continues to support the activity.\nBill Hannon: The other thing I would add is that holding company cash is the amalgamation of lots of activities that take place and one of them is getting money from the operating companies through operating company dividends up to the holding company and that's not done on a basis that says here's what the operating companies earned in the quarter let's bring that up. It's all different timing track to that. So what we do in projecting out what kinds of share buy back activities we should have as we project, because today's holding company cash here the dividend that will come out and going to come out of the operating company here the payments that we are going be making in the holding company for interest and dividends and things of that sort. And these are the amounts of cash that we will have at the end of the third quarter, at the end of the fourth quarter and with that more comprehensive analysis we then come up with. Okay, what is the amount of buy back that we should have and what will that leave us at those points in time with regard to holding company cash.\nVinay Misquith: So fair enough. If I could just ask, bring a follow up on that. So when do you thing this penalty that you have because you have excess cash at the holding company when do you think that will sort of go away because you have finished due purchasing extra stock?\nBrian MacLean: By putting in this guidance saying that we were going to do $3 billion of repurchases for the year that would bring the holding company cash balance down considerably from where it is. We still as Jay and Bill have talked about, you know live in this world where you know we have a recession going on. There's economic uncertainty out there. So doing the $3 billion will not bring us down to the target at the end of the year. We're still being a bit cautious but will bring us considerably lower than where we are today.\nVinay Misquith: Sure. And is the $3 billion for the next 12 months or is it for six months?\nBrian MacLean: The guidance is annual guidance. So you should think about it as we've done $750 million through the second quarter and the 3 billion for the year. So that would leave 2 billion 250 for the rest of the year.\nVinay Misquith: One separate question if I may. I think you mentioned the frequency and severity of loss cost trends were very manageable. I was just hoping you could expand on that. Should we see sort of a stabilization or a continuation of very low frequency and severity trends. Do you think that your current profitability would remain the same over the next 12 months despite pricing being flourished?\nBrian MacLean: I think again this is Brian. I think again you got to think about it a little bit across the spectrum of businesses because there's a lot of businesses here. Frequency trends in our personal, auto business for example have been running very favorably. We're constantly like everybody else trying to figure out the causes there. Some of it is economic driven as in people driving fewer miles etcetera, etcetera. But overall the frequency trends we have been seeing across personal businesses and much of our business insurance have been trends that we have been seeing for a quite of a while. So we don't think they are just short term anomalies. If I get a little of our question I think its similar to the one that are Brian asked a little while ago which is if these trends continue as they are continuing, how do we feel?\nVinay Misquith: Yeah.\nBrian MacLean: Again if you have got frequency levels running in some business actually negative and overall I would say better than historical in severity again this is a broad aggregate across the company; severity running pretty typical that's the positive place to be from a loss trend and then if you get some positive rate with that, margins will improve.\nJay Fishman: Obviously as long as rate change even though it was heading in the right direction as long rate change was still negative that was implying compressing margins or be at it a slower rate. Once that rate change passes above zero you are now talking about at least a possibility of expanding margins depending upon on what happens to loss trends and of course the ability to continue to sustain as positive rate gains and it was and again just a commentary about the quarter. This is a first time in a long, long time where the rate change in all three business segments was positive. So you look out you would say to the extent that continues that's a bullish indicator.\nVinay Misquith: Thank you.\nJay Fishman: Thank you. I don't think we have any more questions and so with that we will close our conference call and thank you all for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

And welcome to the first quarter earnings review for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks. At which time, you may be given instructions for the question and answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning, and welcome to the Traveler\u2019s discussion of our 2009 results. Hopefully, all of you seen our press release, financial supplements, and webcast presentation released earlier morning. All of these materials can be found on our web site at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. With me today is Jay Fishman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alan Schnitzer Head of our Financial, Professional & International Insurance Business; Joe Lacher, Head of our Personal and Select Businesses as well as other business members of Senior Management. We will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. Refer to the webcast presentation as we go through prepared remarks and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast.

All statements other than certain historical facts may be forward looking statements. Including our earning time maybe forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statement that accompanies results of operation, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserve and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward looking statement involves risk and uncertainties and is not a guaranty of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K files with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligations to update forward-looking statements. Also, in response or remarks to questions, we may mention Travelers\u2019 operating incomes, which we view as a measure of profits and other measure that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplements, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website at travelers.com. With that, we\u2019re all set. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, [Gaby]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In light of the overall environment and as it relates to investment performance, recalling that the SMP 500 index traded $6.66 shortly before the end of the first quarter. Our results this quarter were again, quite solid and our financial performance speak for itself in our release. Our management teams can speak to some of the detail in our businesses. And I'll just like to take a moment or two and give a broad perspective on our business trends. From an underwriting perspective, business insurance continues to gain momentum. First quarter data continues to show an improving price trend. And we\u2019ve also seen a continuation of the opportunity we\u2019ve had to quote on more new business, driven we believe, by a flight to quality. It is particularly noteworthy that in this quarter we have been more successful at converting the slow (inaudible) business. And Brian will speak to that important dynamic. Exposure continues to decline. We suspect this as a direct result of the weakening economy. And we\u2019re appropriate on our part to discipline under riding given general economic conditions. Not withstanding several quarters now of improving rate trend, we are mindful of cost pressures that all businesses have so we will watch and wait information carefully quarter-by-quarter to see how it goes and refrain from making predictions. On the personal lines front, during the quarter, we announced our effort to launch a direct to consumer initiative leveraging the Travelers\u2019 brand. There\u2019s been much work to get to this point. The development of Quantum, in addition to allowing us to offer a best in class product to independent agents was critical in giving us a product that can compete with the best direct riders. In order to make quantum successful, we also needed to invest and develop acquaint capacity that could serve as a broad array to all our customers. Lastly the development of Quantum Home gives us a unique advantage in bringing a full product line directly to consumers. The direct to consumer initiative did increase our personal lines combined ratio in the quarter compared to last year and will continue to do so for a number of years. None the less, we are confident in our ability to succeed. And we believe this is an important step in our personal line strategy. We will however, always be and remain independent Asian based company and our commitment to delivering the best product possible at the most compelling value to our agents as paramount in our minds. Joe will of course, speak more of about personal line results and its initiative. Alan Schnitzer will speak about our financial professional and international segment. But I would share with you that the claim activity we are experiencing in our financial and professional lines as of waits to financial related matters is consistent with what we were expecting and what we shared with you last quarter. Consequently and positively, there is no change in our out look in that regard In the investment arena, we continue to be pleased with our portfolio performance in this most difficult environment. Our long term fixed income portfolio produced with terms very much consistent with expectations that our alternative portfolio posted negative returns for the third consecutive quarter. We are pleased that we have had a low level of impairments relative to our $72 dollar investment portfolio and we remain 94% fixed income invested with an average rate in the double A plus. Well in the past, some might have thought our under lighting and investment philosophy to be conservative, we are pleased that the characterization seems now to have morph to prudent. As further evidence, Jay will be sharing with you an interesting analysis of our exposures related to a group of companies Moody's have identified as \u201cbottom rung\u201d. It\u2019s another example of thoughtful risk management in our organization. Finally, given all the recent press reports on merger activity, including some mentioning us. Let me reiterate our philosophy on transactions. First, we will not comment on any specific situation. In addition, given our substantial experience, we believe we understand the risk inherent in an acquisition quite well. Our financial objective is to deliver in mid-teens turn on equity over time to our shareholders. As a result, we would only gauge a new transactions, which given all the risk inherent in the M&A environment, we fundamentally believe makes that mission more achievable. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay\nJay Benet: Thanks, Jay. Our investment portfolio, our reserves, our capital, and all liquidity remain in very good shape. As we have said over many quarters, operating company capital remain at or above all of our target levels. Our debts to total capital ratio actually decreases to 18.9%, which is below our 20% target, the midpoint of a 15% to 25% range that derives from our double A ratings. Holding company liquidity increased over $2.5 billion, which is approximately $1.5 billion higher than our target of one year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends. And this is after using existing funds to retire a $141 million of debt that matured in the quarter. We have negligible amounts of debts maturing through 2011 and still do not rely on the commercial paper markets. Book value per share of $45.12 inclusive of a net unrealized investment gain of $543 million after tax increased 5% during the quarter while book value per share ex-FAS 115 of $44.19 also increased by 2%. And we closed the quarter with approximately $26 billion of common equity. We updated the list on page 5 that shows areas of market disruptions and their impact or lack there of on Travelers. We have added valuations of preferred and hybrid security issued by global financial institutions so the list this quarter of which we current hold only $56 million after having taken impairments of $55 million in the current quarter. Overall, we continue to be unaffected in any significant way from these areas of market disruptions. We continue to look for and evaluate any information that could suggest investment valuation reps. Moody\u2019s has recently issued a publication entitled, Bottom Rang in which they provided 283 speculative grade non-financial US issuers with high default risk. We hold investments in only 14 of these names with an aggregate book value of only $26 million and a total market value of $23 million. Our bond business also reviewed its exposure to the entities on this list. Our commercial and construction surety business have aggregate expose limits to the identified as it is, net of reinsurance and collateral of approximately $270 million. If in a worst case and of course, unrealistic scenario, every account had a full limit loss or after tax exposure would be about $175 million. And as a result of discipline underwriting practices, we believe our actual exposure to loses on these accounts is actually negligible. Our high quality $72 billion investment portfolio, which remains well diversified across industries, investment types, and individual issuers, ended the first quarter with an $803 million free tax unrealized gain. Fixed income investments continued to comprise 94% of the total investment portfolio with a double A plus rating at a 4.2 duration. And the loan investment grade investment comprised only 2% of the fixed income portfolio. We continue to apply very rigorous processes to identify investments for which write down should be made. During the first quarter, we have recorded net realize investment loses of $137 million after tax, including impairments of $120 million after tax, comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008 and representing a very small percentage of both our investment portfolio and our capital. The information that appears on page seven is based on a schedule that it will appear in our form 10-Q showing unrealized losses on investments, which estimated fear value of less than 80% of amortized cost. This amount has decreased from the fourth quarter of 2008 and now stands at $673 million to enlarge parts of the impairment taken on the quarter. While still a small fraction of both total investments and share holders equity, we do closely monitor these investments for these are the most likely source of future impairments. I\u2019d also like to make one of the important observations that is reflective of the discipline and rigor of our investment impairment process. We have no investments for which fair value is less than 80% of cost for more than 12 months and those were in the of 6 to 12 month category adds up to less than a $100 million. Finally I would point to pages 23 through 26 of the webcast, the appendix in which we provide supplementary information about our commercial package securities and the composition of our private equity hedge fund and real estate portfolios. Shown on page eight are operating income of $799 million declined 21% from the prior quarter primarily due to a $176 million after tax reduction and net investment income, which I will discuss further in a minute. Margin compression that we had anticipated in our plan based upon recent pricing and lost cost trends and lower net favorable prior year reserved development, all partially offset by a $40 million reduction on our estimate of Texas Windstorm assessments related to Hurricane Ike, and $69 million in tax benefits resulting from the favorable resolution of various tax matters. Net losses were fairly comparable quarter-to-quarter. Net tax and net favorable prior year development, our GAAP combined ratio is 93.9%. And after adjustment for the change in the (inaudible) estimate, which was worth 1.two points, it was 95.1. So we remain pleased with the underlying profitability of our businesses. First quarter net investment income of $474 million after tax, or which is shown on page nine, was down significantly from the first quarter of 2008, but up slightly from the most recent quarter. The long term fixed income portfolio's after tax yield was 3.7%, consistent with prior periods. Although the short term portfolio yielded only 40 basis points due to the very low interest \u2013 interest rate environment for short term investments. The non-fixed income portfolio yielded a negative 11.1% as private equity real estate partnerships and hedge fund valuation continued to be challenged by financial market conditions. And consistent with our practice, we updated as best we could our non-fixed income returns through March 31 despite the usual time lag in which investment managers report results. Page ten of the webcast shows the three major contributors to our operating return on equity fixed income NII plus interest on corporate debt, what we refer to as the passage of time component, contributed 8.two points in the current quarter, down slightly from prior years due to the lower short term interest rates. Non-fixed income NII, our much smaller contributor to operating ROE, or one that varies from period to period, contributed a negative 1.7 points in the current quarter. And underwriting income contributed 5.9 points. Cumulatively from January 2005, we produced an average annual operating ROE of approximately 14.4%, consistent with our stated longer term goal of mid-teens ROE. And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Turning to slide 11, the business insurance operating earnings of $547 million was down 20% from last year, primarily due to the drop in investment income. The underwriting results had a lot of moving pieces, but in the aggregate, a pretty good story. Net favorable prior year reserve development, although lower than last year, was still considerable at $118 million after tax, and Cap losses were light. Net of these items, our combined ratio improved half a point. We reduced the estimate of our Texas Windpool assessment from Hurricane Ike, lowering our expense ratio nearly one point, and large losses, which were running heavy in first quarter 2008, returned to planned level. Absent all these impacts, the rate and loss trends in business insurance resulted in about two points of margin compression, which was consistent with our expectations. I'll talk about the rate trends as I go through the top line. On the left side, frequency trends are relatively flat and loss inflation remains benign in the low single-digits. We are watching for the impact of a more challenging economic environment on our loss activity, and to date, there hasn\u2019t been anything of significance. So we feel good about the bottom line story, but just as good about the top line. Turning to production, net written premium increased 2% in the first quarter of 2008. As we have reported last quarter, the economic slowdown has negatively impacted those businesses in the construction, constructing fields, as well as large property accounts. However, in spite of the broad economic contraction, many of our businesses are indeed experiencing premium growth. We are pleased with the overall production results, which underscore our ability to find opportunities in difficult conditions. As shown on slide 12, retention remains high across all our domestic commercial businesses, uniformly exceeding first quarter of last year, and at or higher than the fourth quarter. In the face of significant instability in the marketplace, these results reflect customers\u2019 flight quality and are an important component of our continuing success. The renewal price change data indicates that prices on these renewed accounts are relatively stable. And in general, show an improving trend. Slide 13 takes the price change data and splits it into its two primary components, the renewal rate, and exposure change. The trend shows rate change has been moving up. And then in the aggregate, it\u2019s now approaching zero. At the same time, exposure change has been dropping. And in most of our businesses, has turned negative. This of course, is a reflection of the contracting economy. On slide 14, we display our new business results, and this is an area where our story has began to shift very positively over the recent quarter. In the aggregate, new business dollars are up 1% from the first quarter of 2008. This is the first quarter-over-quarter increase in new business in over two years. And a significant improvement from the down 7% to 8% we were experiencing early last year. The improvement is being driven by two factors. First, and clear from the numbers on this slide, our new products and platform roll out in select is having a strong impact. With new business, dollar\u2019s up 20% from first quarter of \u201808. The second is less obvious from this slide. And that is that throughout the quarter, we have seen an improvement in the quality of deal submissions in our middle market businesses. For over a year now, we have had consistent new business methods in business insurance. That is, very strong submission for the flow of new business opportunity, barely constant quote ratios, and slightly declining hit ratios. We were comfortable that although this resulted in less quarter-over-quarter new business dollars, we were getting more opportunities in maintaining our underwriting standards in tough market conditions. So what\u2019s changed? For across a broad array of our new market businesses, these trends have improved with not only greater submission flow, but more importantly, improvement in the quality of that flow. We are now seeing more of our competitors\u2019 premier accounts, those $250,000 to $1 million accounts that are stable, well-managed businesses for a conscious diverged management and value quality partners. Slide 15 shows the amount of new business we are writing in commercial accounts and other business insurance as a percentage of our expiring banks for the last five quarters, as well as month by month in the current quarter. The reason we show the new businesses as a percentage of the expiring date take the impact of seasonality out of the numbers. You can see that in both February and March, we sought significant increase in our new business writings. We usually don\u2019t focus too much on monthly data. But here, we think the trends in the last two months speak into a real new business opportunity for us and is worth some emphasis and explanation. First, I want to emphasize that we feel very good about the profitability of the business. We have lots of metrics around pricing. And our increased writings are hitting target return levels for new business. Second, the increase is not accidental. It is a result of the very conscious strategy to expand product offerings, better rewind our capability, and more proactively seek opportunities in the market. We\u2019ve been talking to you about this for several years, and we believe market conditions are now such that we can see some real benefit. Third, the flight quality is very much agent broker driven. Although somewhat anecdotal, it is clear to us that agents are focused on ensuring that their customers, especially their best quality accounts, are very high-quality markets like Travelers. And this dynamic has been much more noticeable in the recent months. Fourth, the improvement in the rate environment has been an obvious enabler to these results. And lastly, our success is being driven by our confidence in our people on the point of sales. Unlike many of our competitors, we are not on our heels. We are well positioned and looking for ways to invest and drive opportunities. Our frontline staff is fully focused on the marketplace and is energized by our collective success. So we\u2019re not going to predict where the market will go, but we are encouraged by the quarter\u2019s results. Although exposures are contracting, the rate trends are improving and the flight to quality is impacting both the amount and quality of our opportunities. The result is that the business insurance segment produced an improved top line and continued solid market. Given the broad economic contractions, we are very pleased with these results. With that, let me turn you over to Alan Schnitzer for the financial, professional & international results.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Brian. Turning to slide 16, in the financial, professional & international insurance segment, operating income was $148 million for the quarter as compared to $208 million in the prior year. The adjusted combined ratio for the quarter was 91.6%, up 2.8 points from the first quarter of last year. This was primarily driven by a small number of large losses in our international business. These losses were consistent with our expectations, but higher than they were in the first quarter of 2008. To a lesser extent, a mixed change as a result of lower construction surety bonds also impacted the combined ratio. Adjusting to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, net written premiums declined 6%. In bond and financial products, the decreased net written premium is primarily due to lower volumes in the surety business. In the international business, the decrease resulted from changes in foreign exchange rate as well as the timing of reinsurance treaties in 2009 versus 2008. Turning to slide 17, in our management liability business in the quarter, retention remains high and consistent with the past four quarters. Renewal price change was positive at 2%, reflecting positive rate, partially offset by decrease in exposure. New business was a little lower than in the prior year, driven by declines in new business in both financial institutions and private non-profit, largely due to disciplined underwriting. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our public company liability business, primarily due to flight to quality. In the international business, retention was at 78% in the quarter, in line with recent quarters and down 4 points year-over-year, primarily due to intentional underwriting actions. Renewal price change was flat as slightly positive rate was offset by decreased exposure. Adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, new business was ahead of the prior year. In our fourth quarter earnings call, we updated you on the impact of the financial market disruption on our management liability business. As we told you, we continue to monitor that analysis on a monthly basis, and our conclusions remain the same. Due to a well diversified portfolio, and disciplined management of the exposures, we expect that the management liability business will continue to be profitable in 2009. With that, let me turn it over to Joe for discussion on personal insurance.\nJoe Lacher: Thanks, Allan. Personal insurance had a good quarter, solid earning and top line growth. Despite some adverse weather and the challenging auto marketplace, the business continues to demonstrate sound results. Something I\u2019m especially pleased with given these difficult economic times. Our personal insurance business continues to benefit from a balanced mix of auto and property business. When you turn to page 18, you can see the first quarter has strong combined ratio of 93% and a 3% growth in net written premiums. And for the first quarter of 2008, operating income is down $27 million driven primarily by lower levels of net investment income, and increase in weather-related losses, and reduced underwriting margins related to pricing, lost cost trends and mix changes, partially offset by net payable prior year development, and our previously discussed reduction in the two-year assessments. Before getting into product specific results, I\u2019d like to share some details on our exciting direct to consumer initiative. As Jay mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we announced our intention to expand, strengthen and broadly deploy our capabilities to market directly to consumers. Travelers is a leading independent agency company and is committed to enhancing our leadership position with agents. While we believe that the independent agency channel is and will remain vibrant, we also recognize that a growing population of consumers is choosing to purchase auto insurance directly. With our execution strength and by being respectful to valued independent agents deliver, we\u2019re confident we can successfully distribute through both channels simultaneously. Successful introduction of our quantum product and the investment in our claim infrastructure has enabled us to competitively serve a broad cross-section of consumers. We have experience in distributing products outside of the independent agency channels to our robust affinity business. We have been expanding our existing capabilities and increasing our activities to market insurance directly to consumers. We\u2019ve already successfully expanded our web capabilities in advertising. And in the second quarter, we will expand our marketing with a multimedia campaign, including television advertising. We recognize that results to the direct-to-consumer initiative will have an impact on our combined ratio for a number of years. For the full year 2009, we\u2019d expected to have a combined ratio impact of 2.5 points for auto, and one point for homeowner and other. We believe this initiative will better position us to profitably grow our business and is well worth the investment. We\u2019re excited about both our prospects and our early progress. Looking specifically at our auto results, our combined ratio for the quarter was 102% or 3 points higher than the first quarter of 2008. As you can see on page 19, this increase was driven by two points from the results of our direct-to-consumer initiative, and by an additional two points from net unfavorable prior year car (inaudible) reserve development related to New Jersey PIPP and modeling industries. The New Jersey results were driven by a difficult PIPP environment, exacerbated by the fact that we had a number of operational missteps in recognizing and responding to the local environment\u2019s emerging trends. We believe that we\u2019ve identified those underlying issues, reset our organization, and are executing the steps necessary to fix these issues. Excluding the impact of our direct-to-consumer initiative, our full year 2009 guidance assumes an auto combined ratio in the high 90\u2019s. As I mentioned earlier, the direct to consumer initiatives expect to impact the auto combined ratio by 2.5 points for the full year. For those of you who wonder how we foresee a 98 combined ratio, it would mean our return threshold, albeit at the low end of the range. Looking at our auto production results on page 20, retention was 82%, (inaudible) grew 1% over the first quarter of 2008, and renewal price change increased to 5% reflecting proactive rate filing activity. We are seeing a decrease in new business volumes and looking at policies in four state in our statistical supplements, you can see the sequential quarter policies and force decline. We believe that in these challenging economic times, more consumers are demonstrating increased sensitivity to auto premiums. Similar to previous quarters, we experienced auto loss trends declining slightly, severity trend was slightly increasing, was offset by moderately decreased frequency. Turning to property results, we produced an excellent combined ratio of 83%, which is two points lower than first quarter of 2008. Production results for the quarter were strong, but policies enforce growth consistent 3%, retention stable at 86% and renewal price change plus 6%. We remain pleased that continuing growth of the Quantum Home products, and its ability to drive profitable new business despite very challenging economic conditions. Quantum Home policies now represent more than 13% of our policies enforced. Our property business remains the great strength of our personal insurance franchise and one that we will continue to leverage. While the marketplace remains competitive, we are seeing increasing times at priming in the auto line. We are continuing to monitor lost trends, profitability, and marketplace conditions as well as the changing economic environment as we adjust our tactics going forward. We remain pleased with our overall results and look forward to building on that success. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Joe. Page 21 sets forth our annual guidance for 2009 along with certain supporting information. We continue to project fully diluted operating income per share in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, which in round numbers should translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 10% to 11%. Based upon the limited visibility we have of the investment environment today, we will guide you through the lower half of this range. Our guidance assumes full year cat losses of $360 million after tax, or $0.62 per diluted share. No additional prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable. No significant changes in private equity in hedge fund valuations for the remainder of the year as we are assuming unchanged capital market conditions. Lower real estate partnership valuations due to a continuing downward trend in commercial real estate values, share repurchase of $750 million, taking into account potential investment opportunities, for which returns more properly reflect risk and the uncertain economic conditions at all businesses space, rather than a shift in our capital management strategy. Also, no significant change in average invested assets EX-FAS 115 and a weighted average diluted share cap of approximately 585 million shares. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Thanks, Jay. Just a quick closing comment before I turn it back to Gabby to take the questions. We are obviously a very fact-based organization, and we tend to report on statistics very heavily. But I\u2019d like to make an observation that's somewhat anecdotal and really reflects much of what Brian and Joe and Alan have been speaking about for the last half hour. There is a sense of enthusiasm and confidence, and a real upbeat feel in our field organization that is really quite remarkable. It is palpable. And the combination of the dynamics in the industry and in our business, meeting up with that sense of confidence in the field, just gives us a real upbeat sense of where this organization can head over the near term. Can\u2019t give you a specific, there\u2019s no emotion meter that we can measure. But when you sit with any of our field folks, you'll see it, and you'll feel it, and understand it. With that, Gabby, let's take some questions.\nGabby Nawi: Right. Just so you all now, there are no conflicting calls today so we\u2019re prepared to stay on and answer whatever questions you have. And with, Lisa, you can open up the questions, although I ask that you limit it to two, if possible. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Matthew Heimermann with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan: Hi. Good morning, everybody. First, I\u2019ll try to make it good. With the direct strategy, can you talk a little bit about \u2013 and I think you\u2019ve mentioned this in your comments. But how much of the direct market you feel like your product will address on day one? And also whether or not, I know you talked about platform in Quantum and all these other \u2013 in claims that play a role and you being ready to roll out. But is there also now a significant shift in preferred customer shopping directly as well?\nJoe Lacher: Two good questions, Matt. I\u2019ll try to hit them separately. Our quantum product has the capacity to address a very broad cross-section of the marketplace. We don\u2019t target the real need of the standard marketplace. But it does have the ability to hit the broad cross-section. What you\u2019ll see more early though is more a function of brand as we use the Travelers brand and we think about its positioning, we will send our targeting market there. So there\u2019s a need of that brand's appeal, which will be a little bit more towards a preferred end. And it will have a little bit of a recognition of folks who are buying the value proposition that is isn't cheap. It's buying quality. So that target will not hit the full range of what folks think about in the direct marketplace and will expand from there. It\u2019s a plausible way to enter the marketplace, expand our capabilities, build out our experience, and do a leveraging of our position of strength. It will also leverage our homeowners\u2019 capacity, which we really do believe is a unique competitive advantage that we have. And we\u2019ll recognize consumers who are trying to think about the full breadth of their risk. (inaudible) I'm sorry.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan: I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.\nJoe Lacher: Regarding your second question on shopping behavior, we\u2019re seeing increases in shopping behavior. I wouldn\u2019t describe the preferred or highly preferred market moving to level that we typically see in our standard market. I do think you\u2019re seeing increases, albeit from \u2013 in those actually are from a lower starting point. But there is a general economic environment for people who are a little more sensitive to their expenditures and they\u2019re probing and asking questions. They're thinking about exposures. They\u2019re thinking about how to impact net premium and they're more sensitive to rate increases. We haven\u2019t seen \u2013 it's not like we\u2019ve see in a huge percentage of our book calling and checking things, but we have seen increases in call activities and inquiries.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan: That's helpful. With respect to the homeowners\u2019 product, is it \u2013 obviously, well I would guess there would be a package discount for people buying book. But should we think about homeowners as being a driver of the auto or the auto pulling the homeowners? That makes sense?\nJoe Lacher: I think it does. And let me \u2013 you tell me when I answer if I got your point. In all likelihood, in our marketing, we would be auto and we will closely bring in any sales process system and the marketing ability to cover all of your needs, and exactly have those products integrate and work together. We do offer discounts when you buy those in auto and a home, and a discount to the auto, and a discount to the home. We offer that today. So that\u2019s running trough our pricing returning to our results. We will highlight those items, and we will likely draw out the things that help them interact together a little bit more. I think we\u2019ll lead with the auto. I think the benefit of having them together will cause both of them to improve both of their production results.\nJay Fishman: And Matt, I would just add from experience, watching Joe and his management team develop Quantum Auto and Quantum Home, this is really an exceptional group of test and learn. All of the things that we\u2019ve done in this venture have been slow, methodical test and learn. And one of the things that we\u2019re going to do as we move forward here is try any number of different marketing concepts and see which pulls harder. And we don\u2019t necessarily know the answer. And frankly, we\u2019re going to be doing some things that other people either can\u2019t or don\u2019t do because they don\u2019t have the product. But in these early days, Joe is exactly right. We are going to lead with the Auto product. But don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re watching a commercial in a state and see a pull for Hme because we\u2019re going to be testing to see how it does.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan: All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Citi. Please proceed.\nJosh Shanker \u2013 Citi: Good morning, everyone. During the opening remarks where you said that you weren\u2019t going to talk about acquisitions. I won\u2019t even go there. You mentioned that the whole point was to get a mid-teens ROE. And we\u2019re not there right now. I realized there\u2019s some hope of the things are improving the marketplace. But if rates stay where they are right now when you don\u2019t get interest rate improvement, what is the forecast for ROE for the next couple of years? And how do we get that up?\nJay Benet: Our financial goal is actually a mid-teens return on equity over time. And those last two words are really extremely important, not only because of the cyclicality that our industry has experienced historically. Although there\u2019s been less cyclicality over the last several years. We\u2019ve talked about that a lot. And perhaps those who have been involved in the industry for a long term recall. But obviously also because of the weather dynamic. We priced product to produce returns over a long period of time. Sometimes the wind blows, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. Observations up from the \u2013 for the four-year period 2005 through 2008 is that we actually have a 14.5% after tax operating return on equity over that four-year period. So we\u2019re in a cycle, we\u2019re a combination of reasons. Obviously, the investment arena is more challenging at the moment. We are obviously focused on pricing, and we\u2019re going to see how the extent to which we can maintain that strategy. But we want the business for the long term. We priced our product for the long term. We make long term investment decisions. So we\u2019re not going to react in any particularly harsh way to drive returns up. We believe that the industry has the dynamics that enable the best companies to produce those mid-teens return on equity over time. And we think we\u2019re one of them. And we\u2019re on track to continue to do that.\nJosh Shanker \u2013 Citi: Okay. Well let me try and attack from one other way, and then I'll give up. I think that the media might just have been looking for a quote, and they wound up picking on you in order to make their point. But the Travelers will be happy to participate in the PIPP \u2013 or PPIP as a buyer of securities and not as a seller. Maybe you\u2019re just being open-minded about that. But do you have thoughts about getting investment returns up over the next year? Is there less risk out there? Will you be at all opportunistic in this marketplace?\nJay Benet: First, in respect of the comment about the government program, we recalled about 32nd after the announcement of the program and before there were any materials about what it meant to be in the program and what the opportunities were or wouldn\u2019t be. And our response to that was perhaps not as elegant as it might have been, but we\u2019ll consider anything. We\u2019ll certainly consider looking at any program to the extent that there is an opportunity to produce \u2013 to produce returns. As it turns out, it doesn\u2019t look to us like it makes sense for us to participate in that program. The comment about being as a seller was that we had no need to. Our investment portfolio was such was that there was no need to participate in it as a seller. For the moment, our investment profile remains as it has been. There isn\u2019t anything that we\u2019re doing with our cash flow today that\u2019s different from what we were doing six months or a year ago. We run the business for the long term. Yield in returns are perhaps returning to normalize long term levels. But I\u2019ll ask Bill. There isn\u2019t anything that we\u2019re doing different (inaudible).\nBill McLean: Hi. We have always attempted to benchmark risks as opposed to returns. We\u2019d like to maintain a relatively constant level of risk in the portfolio and to get whatever the best return that is possible with that level of risk. And right now that return, of last year or so, has been lower than we liked. We think it might start to get a little higher. But we\u2019re using cash in much the same manner as we have. We\u2019re staying pretty high up the credit scale. I think everybody can agree there has been the equivalent of 100-year flood. But the debate is whether the water is still receding or gently rising. We think it\u2019s still gently rising. We think that there\u2019s a lot of (inaudible) in the system that will have to be liquidated, equitized. And the consequences to get holders in that process maybe pretty severe and would determine if that is true of our securities as possible be subject to it. So we\u2019re concentrating on corporates and municipals with an average quality of AA or better.\nJay Benet: We don\u2019t change to \u2013 attempt to answer your question more specifically, we don\u2019t chase return. Page five of this webcast is what it is because we've had a long standing discipline of not chasing return. We don\u2019t chase it on the underwriting side, and we don\u2019t chase it on the investment side. One of the reasons that we actually stopped buying residential mortgage backed securities at the end of 2004 was that the difference between a Fannie Mae ten-year security obviously rated in AAA. And a then AAA residential mortgage backed security structure, without the implicit guarantee of the US government, the difference was 25 basis points. Well, anyone can say, \u201cGee, AAA is AAA, and those 25 basis points might be worth it.\u201d We tend not to reach for yields. So you\u2019re not going to see a dramatic shift in what we do, either on the insurance side or in the investment side.\nJosh Shanker \u2013 Citi: Thank you for all the response. And good luck to you.\nJay Benet: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital: My question has to do with the pace of pricing improvement in commercial lines. We\u2019ve heard some carriers be more robust in their view of what\u2019s going on currently in the rate environment and Travelers, and some brokers seem to be less optimistic. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of why you think there\u2019s so much disagreement about what\u2019s going on currently in the pace of the rate of change on pricing.\nJay Fishman: Jay, I don\u2019t \u2013This is Jay Fishman, and I'll let Brian step in. I don\u2019t actually think that there is much disagreement amongst different companies. The data is what it is. And we present the data with one of the two companies that actually present the data very clearly, as you can see it and understand it. I read everyone else\u2019s reports, I don\u2019t hear any inconsistencies. Where there is an inconsistency is there are some companies that are very comfortable declaring that we\u2019re at a turn. And they\u2019ve been very bullish and very optimistic about the near term. The circumstances that we are in specifically, lend us \u2013bring us to the conclusion that that\u2019s not the most prudent thing to do. Economic environment\u2019s still very difficult, exposures declining, cost pressures on every business. If anyone thinks that they\u2019ve been in this specific circumstance before, they don\u2019t understand the complexity of it. So what you\u2019re hearing from us is we\u2019re straight on declaring a turn. We\u2019re going to report the data to you. And I\u2019m going to ask Brian to comment again on the rate gains. But the only thing you\u2019re hearing from us in the context of robustness is a willingness to make predictions without the benefit of a crystal ball.\nBrian McLean: Yes. And I think, Jay, we\u2019ve talked about it in the past and so with a lot of other people. There\u2019s a difference between statements that are made by companies based on real data. And there\u2019s a difference from anecdotal surveys. I would argue that the anecdotal surveys are always, by their nature, going to be heavily driven to new business or business that's actively in the marketplace, and that\u2019s not true of each and every account. Looking at the stuff we presented, I think that we feel very good about the momentum, especially in core middle market and broadly \u2013 very broadly speaking, the commercial \u2013 the net commercial businesses. And we\u2019ve turn from a couple 3 to 4 points to negative on pure rate to something that\u2019s pretty close to zero. The small commercial always moves a little slower on up and down. So, it\u2019s moving a little slower up than some of those other markets, but we feel great about the margins in that business. And are pretty happy where we are in the direction we\u2019re going.\nAlan Schnitzer: And, Jay, that maybe \u2013 the underlying mix, maybe some of the discord that you hear, which is if you\u2019re speaking to someone who\u2019s representing a small agency business they\u2019re going to be more strained as we look at our select numbers. And they didn\u2019t go down nearly as much and it has yet to come up very much. And towards the middle market end, you see that if it declined, and now it\u2019s moving up pretty \u2013\nBrian MacLean: And another dynamic that\u2019s important here is all of these data is obviously the average of thousands of different accounts, which are all over the place. So one perspective, a year ago in our middle market business, broadly speaking, about one out of every four accounts we\u2019re getting a price increase. And in today\u2019s environment, about half of our accounts are getting a price increase. And obviously, the remainders go in the other direction. But it's a blending, we look at every account, especially in the individual and direct account stuff. We look at every account individually. And so, broad-versed comments are hard to come by.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital: My follow up \u2013 and thanks very much for that answer. My follow up has to do with the trends in pricing for new business. Can you talk about that, especially in the core market? Is it more aggressive for new business and renewal business on pricing?\nJay Benet: No more so than normal. It is always more aggressive pricing for new business and renewal business. We did talk clearly about our business in the data we have. We agonized over looking at what we believe the returns are on new business that we're writing. We compare it to renewal accounts. We try to adjust for mix and market, and everything you can imagine. We continue to feel pretty good that the business that we're seeing and the business we're writing is still hitting the returns that we would have for writing new accounts. One of the comments I tried to get across is I feel that we, and I suspect not everybody, is seeing an improvement in the quality of the stuff that's out there in the market. And that's made us feel even better about our pricing. But new business is always competitive at one end of the spectrum, and it's been at one end of it for a while. But we feel good about what we're writing.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neil Partners. Please proceed.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neil Partners: Good morning, and thank you for the call. Maybe a little history would be helpful for at least me. Once upon a time, Travelers actually tried to get a direct model going. And clearly, the existence of Quantum is a big difference between then and now. But maybe you could chat about how the process has really changed and why? I think at one point in time there was some pretty convincing arguments that it was not worth the while, where you obviously changed your mind. And can you just maybe compare and contrast the two periods?\nJay Benet: Sure. And I assume what you're talking about is some of the work we've done back in the mid to late 90s with our PFS cross-sell and the secure program that's under cross-sell with our Citibank credit card business?\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neil Partners: Yes.\nJay Fishman: And what we had there \u2013 and I would just add to Joe's point, is that at that point, the company was a subsidiary of Citi Group that is Travelers. And the program that Joe was about to describe was a very structured program designed to take the Travelers' product and make it available to PFS agents. Quite different, just to contrast \u2013 quite different than what we are about to undertake now. But recognize, we were part of Citi Group at that point.\nJay Benet: Yes. Those were programmed again, as Jay described, very specifically not going to a broad consumer population, but leveraging existing populations and existing relationships and shoehorning that distribution platform into our product. And at that time, the complexity of dealing with that shoehorning process and the less effective products that we had relative to Quantum today, those combined to perform \u2013 to produce results that were not great results. We had very much had a product that was tuned towards preferred \u2013 highly preferred costumers distributed through independent agents, and didn\u2019t have the operational infrastructure to deal with the differences that came from this different distribution platform. What we have today is really different on almost every front. The product is meaningfully more sophisticated. We\u2019ve got the folks in-house that know how to deal with that and manage that product, and at the management information to handle it. We\u2019ve rebuilt our claim organization and their ability to manage higher frequency cases with greater efficiency and to manage the severity on those programs. And so, we had the capacity to deliver that. And we\u2019ve rebuilt a good chunk of our systems infrastructure to be able to deal with the other operational impact around us. So it\u2019s almost a different company than it was ten years ago when we tried some of those efforts. So there\u2019s not a lot \u2013 the same other than the fact that we\u2019re still selling auto insurance.\nJay Fishman: Yes. I\u2019ll make two observations. One is that, it really wasn\u2019t a direct sale, it was sale through a captive agent. PFS had a group of captive agents and they were selling the products. So it was not really direct to consumer, this is \u2013 that's quite different. Two, that effort, the captive agent program, was not successful. And one of the terrific things about lack of success is what you learn from it. And so the learnings from that experience are substantial, and in fact formed the basis for much of the operational and tactical thinking that Joe and his group had done and positioned this one to be successful. A good question, but a very, very different program.\nJay Benet: A lot of what we\u2019ve done in the last six or seven years has been tuning those items. And what we really have, as the opportunity here, is we have not spent a lot of time in marketing direct to consumers. And that\u2019s the learning you\u2019re going to see us working on right now. And the core build-out that we have left of the initiative is how to be more effective marketers with the program.\nBrian McLean: And that's, I guess as Jay has mentioned before, way to see our test and learn.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neil Partners: Good. Are you going to have different prices in product tweaks for direct versus agency?\nJay Benet: No. Right now we\u2019ve got one product, one pricing platform. And we\u2019re going to leverage that and use that in both environments.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neil Partners: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney. Please proceed.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney: Thank you, and good morning. Can you quantify what the non-Cat weather was in the quarter?\nJay Benet: The bulk of it was personal line related. And it was just an increase in the general weather activity, things that didn\u2019t classify as Cat, by our definition of Cat, whether it was with storm activity, basic thunderstorm activity, hail, tornadoes. I\u2019m looking for the number as we\u2019re \u2013 as I\u2019m answering it.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney: Keep talking.\nJay Benet: Just let me \u2013 give us a minute to find the exact number, Larry.\nJay Benet: On the business insurance side, it was a modest positive. The negative bearings was on the personal side.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney: Okay. Great. And then just numbers or accounting question, the Texas Windstorm, that\u2019s accounted for in the expense ratio as opposed to the loss ratio? And then secondly, on the discussion on the direct consumer, the press release described the impact as the results, not the investment in it. So going forward, when we see what the impact is, is that going to include those underwriting results and the investment in the new program?\nJay Benet: We try to hit all of those and assuming reverse orders. It is describing the results, which includes the underwriting and the expense, and everything around it. It's a total view there. And that's what we intend to talk about to get a more wholesome disclosure.\nJay Fishman: And through that point, in the early period, Larry, of the program, we will have underwriting losses like we in the (inaudible) experienced in the direct channel is that you test and learn. And that test and learn experience will (inaudible) itself. We believe those underwriting losses in the direct channel. And so we intend to continue to give disclosure and clarity throughout its entirety.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney: Okay. Just on that point, do you have an expected breakeven period?\nJay Benet: You know the complexity underneath this. There's breakeven on an economic basis, and there is breakeven on a reported basis. You will be \u2013 it'll be several years before we get to that number, and we're not \u2013 (inaudible) disclosing that projection. It will hit economic breakeven, obviously, before it hips a GAAP reporting breakeven.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney: Okay. That's fair. Thanks.\nJay Fishman: This is Jay, Larry. Just in terms of a small weather impact, for round numbers on an after tax basis, it looks like it's about $20 million if you look at it on period-over-period basis. So that would be the delta. And relative to your accounting question with regard to assessments, you are right. The accounting that we do is to take assessments like (inaudible), and put them through the expense line because there will be recoveries in the future associated with taxes, licenses, and fee accounting. So that's where it all is.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator instructions) And our next question will come from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: Thanks a lot. A couple of quick questions, one, would it be possible to break down the change in unrealized just by a couple of the large categories, maybe your non-agency mortgage backs, the corporate debts, and maybe offsets in some of the other asset categories. And I just have one follow up. Thank you.\nJay Fishman: In terms of \u2013 we could \u2013\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: In broad strokes. I just want to understand where \u2013 I mean where did a lot of the mark come, in one group or in another; just to understand how the quarters stack up?\nJay Fishman: The primary change in unrealized came about because of the Munich portfolio. If you looked at the marks on the Munich portfolio as of the end of the year, they were different than where they were now. I think that would be the primary driver of the change.\nJay Benet: And the VAT, it was largely an improvement in the ratio of yield, the Treasury yield. Because as you remember, the ten-year backed up from $2.21 to $2.66 in the first quarter.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: All right. Great. And then, as far as the Select business and on the business side, was there any segment that benefited from improved penetration there over any other, any of the main line GL, comp, or any of those other recording segments?\nJay Benet: Yes. In Select, we've seen \u2013 all of our lines of business experienced productivity, increase in sales and growth. Our comp business, particularly relative to, say, a year ago or three years ago, has seen probably the most significant amount of growth.\nJay Fishman: And they are as a result of a very intentional strategy.\nJay Benet: It's a very intentional strategy to bring our Travelers Express operational model and pricing model and capabilities there. We feel very good about the underlying margins, and track them in a whole variety of different ways very specifically. So we feel good about that underlying growth.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: Right. And is the profile \u2013 the new \u2013 that new comp business or is it any different than the profile of the existing book of business that you have? Or just more penetration into the same margin?\nJay Benet: Particularly on the Travelers Express side, it is consistent or better than the profile book of business that we have.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your presentation for today. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Sharon. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2010 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor Section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it for questions.  Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note on Page 1 of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available on our website.  Thank you. And I'd like to turn it over to Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with the results that we're reporting today, not only for what they say about 2010, but also for how they continue to demonstrate the strength of the Travelers' franchise and how well-positioned we are for the future.  Our operating return on equity for the full year was 12.5% and our growth in book value per share for the year was 11%, both including or excluding net unrealized gains on our investment portfolio. Since the beginning of 2005, our average annual operating return on equity is 14.1% and our compound annual growth in book value per share is 12.9% or 11.5%, excluding the impact of FAS 115.  Since we began our share repurchase program in the middle of 2006, we have repurchased nearly 289 million shares for $14.5 billion at an average price per share of $50.15. The shares repurchased now total approximately 42% of the shares that were outstanding at the time we began the program. We have accomplished all this notwithstanding an operating environment that, over these years, can only be described as complex. Positively, loss cost trends during this period have been relatively benign and have certainly contributed to the significant favorable prior year reserve development we've experienced. Negatively, the difficult economic conditions over the last three years have contributed to declining exposures, deteriorating pricing, challenging credit markets and historically low interest rates.  The industry has also faced three significant catastrophe years in the period that is 2005, 2008 and 2010. And two years, 2006 and 2007, that had low levels of cap losses. We believe that our consistent top tier performance over these six challenging years demonstrates a fundamental competitive advantage that we have in assessing risk and reward on both the liability and asset sides of the balance sheet.  Risk selection has been a key driver of our performance over this period and, with our investments in talent and infrastructure, will continue to drive our performance in the future. In terms of the current operating environment, Brian will take you through it in more detail. Given some of the trends we saw in the fourth quarter, we are somewhat more optimistic than we were a few months ago.  In Business Insurance, exposure changes, one element of demand for our product, was positive for the first time in nine consecutive quarters. With respect to pricing, as we've shared with you previously, renewal pricing in Business Insurance has been about flat for most of 2010, results that are obviously better than those that have been reported in the CIAB surveys. In the fourth quarter, renewal pricing in Business Insurance not only improved versus the third quarter but also within the quarter as the months progressed. While these comments are not intended to forecast future pricing, these results suggest that our pricing strategy is beginning to have some traction and we hope it continues.  Given our strong retentions as well as the new business and account growth we've achieved over the last few years, we have significant positive leverage to an improving environment. The final thing I'd like to leave you with, and again Brian will take you through the details, is our performance and position in Personal Insurance.  In our Agency Homeowners business, we grew policies in force by 3% and, despite the significant catastrophe activity during the year, we delivered a combined ratio of 95% for the full year. Let me spend just a moment on what that performance really indicates.  The 95% combined ratio that we posted reflects 15 points of catastrophe losses for the year, as well as the impact of some favorable reserve development in the line. But even excluding the impact of favorable prior year reserve development in the line, we would still be well under a 100 combined ratio. We believe that this performance meaningfully demonstrates the success of our Homeowners strategy.  In our Agency Auto business, we grew policies in force by 2% and delivered improved profitability, posting a combined ratio of 97%. Personal Insurance now represents 35% of our net written premiums. And we're pleased with what we have achieved and optimistic with what we believe we can continue to deliver.  To conclude, we're confident in our ability to select and manage risk regardless of the operating environment. We're hopeful that we'll see an improving operating environment in Business Insurance. We're pleased with the solid performance in Financial, Professional & International businesses, and we're optimistic for our prospects in Personal Insurance.  And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Jay. I'd like to start with a few overall comments about fourth quarter and full year results shown on Pages 4 through 7 of the webcast.  Fourth quarter operating income of $864 million is lower than our very strong fourth quarter of 2009 in which we earned $1.155 billion. There are a few easily understood reasons for this. Favorable prior year development was higher by $100 million after tax in last year's quarter. Cat [catastrophe] losses were lower by $45 million after tax in last year's quarter. Fourth quarter 2009 included the benefit of a favorable re-estimation of current year loss ratios for the first three quarters of 2009, amounting to $52 million after tax. And the current year quarter included costs of $39 million after tax, which reduced fourth quarter fully diluted operating income per share by $0.09 related to our purchase and retirement of a large portion of our hybrid debt.  Operating results, excluding the impact of these items and including net investment income, remained in line with our original expectations, taking into account normal quarterly fluctuations and non-cat [non-catastrophic] weather and large loss activity, as well as the timing of expenditures.  We had another quarter of net favorable prior year reserve development in each of our segments, concentrated once again in BI and FP&II. And although somewhat higher than in the prior year quarter, cat losses in the current quarter were lower than what we would normally plan for. And finally, fourth quarter operating ROE was 14.5%.  Turning to the full year. The very large cat activity during the first half of the year resulted in significantly higher catastrophe losses as compared to full year 2009. This significant increase in full year cat losses, coupled with slightly lower net favorable prior year reserve development and the costs of purchasing and retiring our hybrids, accounted for almost all of the reduction in full year operating income as compared to 2009.  Book value per share, while down 1% in the quarter due to the recent rise in interest rates, was up 11% from a year ago; and all of our capital, leverage and liquidity measures compared favorably to our target levels.  Some additional items are also worth noting. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the early part of the fourth quarter, we issued $500 million of 10-year, 3.9% senior notes and $750 million of 30-year, 5.35% senior notes, using $885 million of the proceeds to purchase and retire the more expensive hybrid securities we had outstanding.  We ended the year with holding company liquidity of $3.6 billion, more than 3x our target due to strong earnings and the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our holding company. And our earnings strength, coupled with the strength of our balance sheet, allowed us to significantly increase share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter. We repurchased 1.6 billion of our common shares during the quarter, bringing total share repurchases for the year to 5 billion and leading our Board to authorize another 5 billion of future share repurchases in addition to the 1.5 billion remaining under the prior authorization. Overall, for the full year 2010, the total cash we returned to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends amounted to $5.7 billion.  Our strong holding company liquidity and operating company surplus enables us to plan for 2011 dividends and share repurchases that we expect will be well in excess of projected 2011 operating income. A simple way for you to estimate our 2011 share repurchases would be to start with your estimate of our after-tax operating income, and add to it our additional capacity for share repurchases, which we currently estimate to be approximately $1.5 billion. This, I should stress, is in addition to our normal dividends. Remember, we're not saying that our share repurchases will only be $1.5 billion, rather we expect share repurchases will be the total of the $1.5 billion plus estimated operating income.  Total dollars to be returned to shareholders will, therefore, be this amount plus our dividends. Hopefully, this is clear. I remind you that anytime we provide information concerning future share repurchases, we're assuming no significant changes in the operating and investment environments, relatively normal cat and no prior year reserve development, among other assumptions.  I'd also like to make a few comments relating to Page 8 of the webcast. During the third quarter earnings call, I referred to the historically low interest rate environment and provided an illustration based upon our investment portfolio scheduled bond maturities in 2011, 2012 and 2013, of the impact on net investment income in those years if the then-current interest rate environment persisted through 2013 and all other variables, such as average assets mix, credit quality and duration remain constant. Since then, interest rates have risen by approximately 75 basis points.  So I've updated the illustration for you. As can be seen on Page 8, the projected reduction in net investment income as calculated in the updated illustration is even less than in the prior illustration, which was not large to begin with. So please note, I don't plan to update this information going forward.  And with that, I'll turn things over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Consistent with last quarter, I will not be going through all the webcast slides, but will take any questions you may have on the disclosures on Pages 11 through 22. Instead, I will share some perspectives on our business and the marketplace. And in short, I'll make three basic points.  In Business Insurance, we're beginning to see early signs of improving market conditions. In Personal Insurance, we're bullish on our business. And in Financial, Professional & International, we're pleased with our underlying results given what is still a dynamic and challenging environment. So with that as a backdrop, let me give a little more detail.  In Business Insurance, we continue to be pleased with our overall production results this quarter. Account retention remained strong. We've seen exposure trend positive and we continue to see strong new business flow. On the pricing side, you can see on Slide 10 that the fourth quarter saw us post the first positive renewal premium change since the first quarter of 2007. And the results of all of this is an increase in gross and net written premium year-over-year. The favorable trends and exposure that we have previously observed have continued to the point where renewal exposure turned positive during the quarter.  On Slide 11, we have graphed our exposure change by quarter from 2006 to the present. Exposures began to drop in late 2008 as the economic downturn began. The decline accelerated into early 2009 and began to moderate throughout 2010. Based on the positive change in exposure in the fourth quarter of 2010, it appears that the impact of the decline in economic activity on our Business Insurance clients has bottomed out and we're seeing some firming.  On the rate side of renewal premium change, while the rate change was slightly negative for the quarter, we've seen a subtle shift in the pricing environment within the quarter as the market seemed more receptive to rate increases. We are hopeful that this pricing trend will continue.  Our underwriting margins for the quarter and full year, after our typical normalizing adjustments, were consistent with our expectations and continued to show modest compression due to loss cost trends slightly outpacing earned rate change. The solid results that we continue to see in this segment demonstrate the value of our underwriting strategy that we have articulated a number of times, and that is: retain our quality business, optimize the profitability on this retained book by getting rate where appropriate, and write new business wherever we see an acceptable balance of risk and reward.  As we begin to see a turn in the broader economy, we believe sustained, focused execution of our strategy will allow us to deliver on our commitments to continued growth and profitability.  For Personal Insurance, I want to follow on Jay's comments to emphasize how positive we feel about this business. Having a robust Personal Insurance franchise with a strong agency channel is a competitive advantage and sets us apart from many of our key competitors. Both our Personal, Auto and Homeowners and Other products have delivered outstanding growth in margins in an especially challenging economy. In fact, in 2010, Personal Insurance delivered record earned premium and policies in force.  In our Agency Auto business, we achieved meaningful growth in a stagnant market while simultaneously improving on our already strong underwriting margins. New business growth was up significantly over prior year, which, coupled with solid retention, led to a 2% increase in policies in force from a year ago. Margins increased both for the quarter and the full year, resulting from continued discipline with our pricing and underwriting strategies. Our strong margins in this business position us well for continued success in a highly competitive market.  Similarly, we feel great about our Agency Homeowners and Other results. Although new business is down slightly from the fourth quarter last year, retention and renewal premium change were both up, leading to substantial growth in topline and policies and in force. Adjusting for catastrophes and prior year development, we saw full year underwriting returns improve from 2009 as earned rate actions exceeded loss costs. Given the uncertain economy and, in particular, the weak housing market, we are very pleased with our results and believe we are well positioned in this market.  Turning to the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. Net written premiums were down in the quarter driven by several factors. First, the continued sluggishness in the economy, and particularly the impact on public and private construction spending, has significantly affected the volume of surety business in the marketplace. Second, primarily as a result of a challenging rate environment, we've scaled back the property exposure in our Lloyd's business. And third, in Ireland, we ended an exclusive relationship with a distribution partner in the fourth quarter.  International growth remains a key investment area for us and we continue to look for opportunities in our existing footprint as well as in emerging markets. In that regard, we are very excited about the joint venture in Brazil that we announced in November, and Alan Schnitzer will speak to that transaction in a few moments.  Excluding prior year development, margins in our International business for the quarter remained relatively flat year-over-year. In Bond & Financial products, we continue to see a challenging growth environment. As I said, in the surety business, the economy is resulting in a lack of business opportunity, but our margins remain strong.  In Management Liability, not unlike our Business Insurance strategy, we remain focused on executing a disciplined underwriting approach, retaining the quality business, getting rate where it's needed, writing new business wherever we see an acceptable balance of risk and reward, and positioning for growth when it makes sense.  In summary, we feel great about the execution across all our business segments and how we are positioned going forward. By maintaining our underwriting discipline and commitment to invest in and maximize the long-term value of our portfolio, we've continued to deliver solid results while at the same time, expand our ability to deliver future growth.  With that, let me turn it over to Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Brian. As you may have seen in November, we announced that we had entered into a joint venture agreement under which we will invest approximately $370 million for 43% of the common stock of J. Malucelli, the market leader in the surety business in Brazil. And we have an option to increase our interest to 49.9% within 18 months.  Our investment in newly issued shares will significantly increase J. Malucelli's capital level, positioning the joint venture for substantial growth. We currently expect the transaction will close in the first half of this year. We've been carefully considering our emerging market strategy for some time and we're very pleased with this investment as a first step.  We view it as a significant opportunity for us to leverage our leading U.S. surety franchise to enter one of the fastest growing insurance markets in the world, and to do so with the benefit of a local market leader. In addition to the surety opportunity, we believe that the combination of our broad insurance expertise, with J. Malucelli's established distribution network and customer base, gives us an exceptional platform for expanding into the growing P&C market in Brazil.  We've known the leadership of J. Malucelli for a number of years and we have the highest regard for them. The opportunity to be in business with them is a key consideration for us. They've built a great franchise by knowing their customers and through disciplined, analytic-driven underwriting, much the same way we built our business. Importantly, we share a common ambition for profitable growth.  With that, I'll turn it back to Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thanks, Alan. Before we open it up for questions, I just want to take a minute to echo the comments that Alan made a moment ago.  We're very pleased and proud to be partnering with the Malucelli family in the Brazilian venture. We couldn't pick a better partner to have and we firmly believe that our business philosophies are remarkably compatible. I'd just like to personally send my best regards to them and let them know how excited we are about our future together.  Also, I just want to take a moment to thank all The Travelers' employees who participated in the due diligence. It was hard work and it was all very well done.  With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. We're going to open up for questions but before we do that, if I can ask callers to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can get to everybody. Thank you.  Sharon, we're ready to start Q&A session, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: The first is on the municipal exposure, the impact to the marks was somewhat better than we were modeling. Perhaps you can talk a little bit about that in terms of how you're marking the municipals and how you're thinking about that investment class, probably given what's been going on in the past couple months? And the other question has to do with the share buyback. Our sense is Travelers could buy back around $4 billion in stock in 2011. If we look back at what was originally offered for guidance in 2010, the original starting point was $3.5 billion to $4 billion, ultimately it ended up at $5 billion. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what might give upside to your initial view on buyback activity?\nWilliam Heyman: Jay, Bill Heyman. The first question, in terms of how we mark them, they're marked independently. We obviously don't pick our own prices. But to the second, if you look at the fourth quarter change in mark-to-market, about 80% track the mark-to-market of Treasuries. So what remained wasn't very large. And we attribute that to the high credit quality of the portfolio. As was always true in the high yield market, it has now become true in the municipal market, that the biggest single determinant of prices is the flow of cash in and out of municipal bond funds. And those flows exhibited a lot of volatility in the fourth quarter. What is interesting to me is when municipal bond funds sell holdings in bulk to raise cash, they circulate bid-wanted lists, which we see through the dealers. And we comb them for opportunities. We rarely find bonds that are on our list of bonds approved for purchase. And when we find one, we rarely find it at a price we're inclined to pay. So that means to me that we've set the bar pretty high, which in times like these is good. In terms of the news that has dominated the press in the last quarter, I'm really going back further than the last quarter, I guess I would say some of it's news, some of it isn't news. That state and local finances were stressed has been known to every serious institutional participant in the market and has informed our investment decisions for five or six years, not just recently. It may be news to the general public. And that has had good consequences. It has lead state and local officials to confront these problems in the last three or four months in a way that hasn't been evident before. So, perversely almost, we're encouraged by what we read.\nJay Fishman: And as we were chatting about this before, Jay, in respect to your question relative to the index, I think that the three principal differences are: the mix of securities that we hold relative to the mix that are contained in the index; two, our duration is shorter than the duration of the index; and the third piece, and probably the least significant of the three but nonetheless meaningful, is that the credit quality of our portfolio is at a different level than the credit quality of the overall index. So those who have been using the index to make estimations of change in market values are going to get inaccurate results.\nJay Benet: As for the question on the share repurchases, just going back to last year, when we originally provided some guidance as to what we thought the share repurchases were going to be, it was based upon what we thought our earnings would look like as well as the starting capital and cash positions that we had at the beginning of that year. So to the extent we increased the amount of buybacks, it was a refinement of both of those parameters. We saw earnings that included favorable prior year development last year. We hadn't considered that, of course, in our earnings guidance. And to the extent we have favorable development that adds to our earnings, we adjust our buybacks accordingly. And we'll continue to do that going into the future. As it relates to the capital position at the beginning of this year and the cash position at the beginning of this year, being 2011 now, we factor in where our operating company capital is, what the holding company cash is, points you to the item that I mentioned earlier. We do have $3.6 billion at the holding company that allows us to look at share repurchases in excess of what we think our current year operating income is going to be. So all those things are factored into the estimate that we provided, Jay. And I hope that fully answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Walsh with Citi.\nKeith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: First question, just within the release, you mention that the loss ratio, a potential modest increase in 2011. If you could give us a little more color around that?\nBrian MacLean: Keith, this is Brian MacLean. I mean it's really just the simple arithmetic of, on the loss trend side, we're expecting what we've been seeing, which is frequency running at near flat levels, which is good.\nJay Fishman: That doesn't mean zero. That means it's not changing from current levels.\nBrian MacLean: Right. Frequency change, right. Severity trends running somewhat consistent with inflation, and that is low single-digit loss ratio impacts. And across the Commercial business, very modest earned rates. So the net of that would be a slight margin compression. The Personal Insurance dynamic, a little different. Greg, why don't you just kind of run through the same things for Auto & Home.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, for Automobile, we're certainly seeing a contained environment from frequency. A little offsetting pressures on severity, but you see our RP, our RPC [ph] is offsetting those loss trends. On the property side, just due to the volatility of that line, when we normalize some of the peaks of the weather, we're seeing frequency relatively flat, in the low single digits, and severity upward in the higher single digits, and you see our two consecutive quarters of RPC of 9%, so we feel good about both of the products inside the Personal line portfolio.\nJay Fishman: So again, just to make sure we say it in English. In the Personal Insurance business, we would anticipate expanding margin risk, and in the Business Insurance line, we expect modestly contracting margins.\nKeith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: And then second question, just going back to munies. If you could just mention, talk to, if we saw a rating agency downgrade on a bond, would that trigger a loss? Then thinking about -- there's a lot of talk about states declaring bankruptcy, what would the implications be there? And then finally, spread opportunities must be actually quite attractive for new money right now. How are you thinking about that?\nWilliam Heyman: Well, with respect to ratings, as you probably know, in the last year or so, at probably not the best moment, municipal ratings were pushed upward so that a given rating implied the same probability as default based on history as it does on the corporate side. So yes, we watch the ratings carefully for downgrades, but we attach less importance to them than outsiders might think. Yes, we like the aggregate credit rating of our portfolio, but it would be very easy to construct a portfolio with the exact same aggregate credit rating with which we were very uncomfortable. So we're not slaves to the ratings. When ratings change on either the municipal or the corporate side, the first take we do, certainly the first take I do, is does this mean that the probability of the instrument being money good is significantly lower? If not, we generally stick with it.\nJay Fishman: And this is Jay Fishman. Let me cover briefly the issue of the potential change in bankruptcy. Those who don't know there's been some chatter and a New York Times article last week reporting on some consideration about amendments to the federal bankruptcy code that would allow states access to it. Right now, the states don't have such access. It's obviously an extremely complicated issue, both legally as well as politically. And as we parse through it a bit, there are, in addition, serious issues of constitutional law. And it's not at all clear, really, what people are actually discussing and, therefore, what the implications might be. It's been interesting to us over these last few days to listen to a few states actually reject the notion that, even if such an access were provided to them, that they would seek it. It reminds me a little bit like being -- taking a horse to water but not necessarily getting them to drink. So we'll watch carefully as to what happens. But let me just make a couple of points which I think really are relevant. First, there seems to be this bias amongst even sophisticated people to view municipal securities are all the same, as if somehow we own some pro rata share of an aggregate marketplace. And that's just not the case. Everyone understands that in the taxable fixed-income world, the issuer and the specific terms and conditions of the instrument matter. And that's equally as true in the municipal arena. And in fact, something that's not often understood is that a significant portion of our municipal portfolio is actually secured by a pledge of specific revenue streams. And by the way, in the context of municipalities that do have access to the bankruptcy code, the view is that those pledge of specific revenue streams would survive a bankruptcy filing and, in fact, those securities would continue to be paid in the ordinary course. Now, of course, that's an assumption that, that same condition would hold true at the state level if the states were allowed such access. So we'll watch this carefully, and it will always, as Bill spoke earlier, affect our view of risk and reward. And when we think that there is some change that we ought to be making in the portfolio, we'll make it. But let me close with a little bit of data that perhaps you'll find interesting, which is, to Bill's point earlier, this is not new news to us. It's an issue and a concern that we have been watching for a very long time. If one takes the 10 states, 10 states, that at least our analysis suggests are the most challenged, whether that's through pension or medical liability, medical payments, or debt obligations, we own an aggregate in all of those 10 states. And this is excluding pre-refunded bonds, we own an aggregate of $1 billion of state-issued general obligation bonds in those entire 10 states. That represents 3.1% of our municipal portfolio. And in terms of maturity, about 23% of that $1 billion matures in the next three years and about 46% matures in the next five years. So even if one looks at those states that have been spoken about in the press or those that people view as being challenged, our position with respect to those states is actually modest relative to the entire portfolio and it remains an area where we watch and look carefully.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: I wanted to just explore within the presentation that it looks to me like you guys are now getting rate across most of your business lines, just raw pricing. And I wanted to sort of tie that to your assumption with regards to the loss -- the margin outlook for this year. What is the disconnect there? Because it seems to me that if rate is going up, which I think is different than expectations, why would margins be going down from a loss cost perspective?\nBrian MacLean: Greg, this is Brian, again. So just to work backwards a little bit, butt to say it. Personal Lines, simplistically, we are clearly getting price and we believe margins are expanding a little bit. So the question I assume is on the Commercial, the Business Insurance side. And there, I think you can see the numbers that, first of all, the rate that we're getting on a written basis is pretty modest at this point. So think of less than a point. Actually, the renewal rate for the quarter on Page 12 is still a fractionally negative number. So we're looking at modest improvement. There's also an earn dynamic here, where if you look at what's going to earn through the income statement as the year plays out, it takes a few quarters. Even if that starts to ramp up, it's going to take a few quarters to have that have an impact on the P&L. So when we look at some modest rate and what, pick whatever number you want, but two, three, whatever loss ratio points of pressure from the loss side, it nets to a modest negative.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: So there's nothing in your book that you're seeing in particular that has changed?\nBrian MacLean: We tried to pick the right words but we think subtly, in the fourth quarter, we saw some lift in -- as we went through the months of the quarter, some lift in the Commercial pricing environment. And also, we talk a lot about -- we're a disciplined company, we talk about the numbers. We also do talk to our people, talk to brokers, talk to agents, talk to customers, and so we have a mood. And that mood seems to be marginally more positive or less negative, however you want to say it, in recent months and we're encouraged by that.\nJay Fishman: And Greg as I explained in my comments, written renewal rate in Business Insurance for the year was about flat. That written rate is going to convert to earned as we turn into 2011. We still anticipate, as we always do, a loss trend that has some lift to it. And if you've got flat earned rate and some loss trend, you've got slightly compressing margins. Our hope is, as I said earlier, that what we saw in the fourth quarter continues. It's not a prediction. But if we saw in the fourth quarter and that line continues, one can anticipate getting to positive rate on a written basis sometime in 2011. And obviously, that will get earned in the following months as well. So it's predominantly what's happened over the last 12 months defining what will be recorded over the next 12 months.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: And just totally to shift gears in the last question, is at the holding company level, the liquidity jumped considerably sequential. Did you all do a special dividend through the quarter? How much? And how can we, from the outside, sort of think about that going forward? Because you've been great in terms of the capital management visibility into this year, but the one thing we can't see is what you're taking out of the subs and the willingness to do that.\nJay Benet: Well, in some respects, you can see it, if you take a look at the statutory surplus levels that we describe in the supplement. So that won't give you a reconciliation, but at least give you a feel for what the subs are carrying. But your specific question of, in the fourth quarter, what did we do? We did take out dividends out of the operating companies. Given the size of the dividends, we did require regulatory approval, which we got with no issues whatsoever. We have good relationships with the states. We're very forthcoming in terms of what our levels are, what our plans are. And we took out about $2 billion in the fourth quarter, brought it up to the holding company and ended up, as I said, with operating company capital that, for all our operating companies, were at or above our target levels.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: So did you take about $3 billion out in 2010 then in total?\nJay Benet: It was actually more than that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant with KBW.\nCliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc.: I was interested in the Brazilian joint venture and just wondering if this is a sign that perhaps you're more interested in international expansion. Generally, what is your appetite for international acquisitions?\nJay Fishman: Cliff, we have talked before with you all about having an interest in what I would characterize as a fairly limited number of developing markets. We talked about having an interest in developing a joint venture in India. We actually were in the preliminary stages at one point and had identified a partner there. Ultimately, concluded that the partner's business interests and their business philosophies were not compatible with our own and we broke that off. We still have a desire to enter into a business relationship in India. There's 1,300,000,000 people with an economy growing at 9%, 10%, more for the next generation of leadership of this company than the one that's here now. I think you just got to believe that, that will eventually turn into a very robust insurance market. And one that remains nascent, tiny, by any standard and very much up for grabs. So we want to be there. The Malucelli situation was really very opportunistic. And it really came about because of an outreach from the folks in Brazil. And I'll have Alan speak about this. The Malucelli group reaching out to our surety business, obviously, the leading by market share surety business in the United States, to talk about learning about doing business together, and out of that grew this opportunities.\nAlan Schnitzer: That's right. We've been thinking doing about the emerging market opportunities for some time and evaluating what might be best for our first step. And as we were spending time in Brazil, the Malucellis reached out to us. And just given the really high compatibility of operating philosophies and ambitions, both short term and long term, it just seemed like a great opportunity for us to make a first investment in the emerging markets. And we'll continue to look in other emerging markets and evaluate those opportunities over time as well.\nJay Fishman: It's not a global ambition. Our view is that our goal is to create shareholder value by producing mid-teens return on equity over time. And whether we do that with more in the emerging markets or a little less in emerging markets, we always keep in mind what our target is. We don't have any ambition to be a global company and we will look for our spots in the international arena very carefully, where capital can be deployed at a reasonable level of risk, but the returns are commensurate with. The projected returns are commensurate with the risk that one takes on. Again, tying it right back to where I started my comments this morning of thoughtful evaluation of risk and reward. It's not about size.\nAlan Schnitzer: And as Brian mentioned before, we like our existing footprint and we'll continue to look for opportunities to leverage our sense of U.S. product set in those geographies as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: First, when you think about your outlook or your hope for pricing and loss costs in 2011, can you just maybe give us a handicap of whether or not you think the risks are more to the upside or the downside in terms of how you might be surprised on rate and loss cost? And then the second question would be on workers comp. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on some of the trends you're seeing both in the loss sensitive side of the business as well as the guaranteed cost side?\nJay Fishman: With respect to the first question, Matthew, I think the only way I can respond is to look back historically, which is that over the last several years, loss trend has been less than we had assumed it would be. And that's happened in large measure because frequency was less than we had assumed it would be, but also because inflation has been -- from a severity perspective has been quite benign. So that's been the trend over the last four, five years. I'm not an economist and I'm not going to attempt to make any predictions or forecasts. Relative to pricing, we've been pretty transparent about what our pricing strategy has been, which is that we've been attempting to get rate where we need it. And that's especially true in circumstances where an account's loss experience has been inconsistent with that which we anticipated or projected when we underwrote the account. There's nothing new about our pricing strategy. It was just interesting to us that, in the fourth quarter, it was more the market, and I hate to use that phrase because it always sounds like our pricing strategy is not active. It's a very active one. But we were able to effect that pricing strategy with greater success than we had previously. And so I think that's the answer I'm at. But one thing that is interesting is if the exposure projections are what they are, if you look at what's happened to exposure over the last 12 months, it's not too hard to project a line of increasing exposures into 2011. And that, given the account growth that we've had over the last several years, would be a nice factor. So that's the best way to service that, that I think.\nBrian MacLean: And Matt, this is Brian. On the comp side, I'd start by saying, our data would say we've been pretty good in this business. Our combined ratio for a good number of years has run up a fairly significant favorable delta to the industry. And we think that's due to a real disciplined selection process, and so that's by industry, that's by state. And secondly, we believe we've got a real claim advantage in how we manage those claims, both the lost time and the medical dimension to that. So we feel great about our Comp book. With that said, there are clearly pockets of heat coming through Comp line. And there are certain states and certain environments that have become more challenging and we're watching those closely. The favorable side there would be that it's probably the line that's got a little bit of pricing energy to it. And so we hope that, that will continue. I don't think -- I'll throw the book on you. I don't think we're seeing anything fundamentally different on the guaranteed cost versus the lost sense of the book.\nJay Fishman: Let me just ask Eric [ph] here, because he used the phrase, \"pockets of heat.\" That has a certain energy to it. Do you want to expound on it just a little bit?\nWilliam Cunningham: Sure. I mean as we look at our worker's compensation approach, we're looking at it state-by-state, industry-by-industry. And as we look at some states, given some jurisdictional issues, we see more pressure on loss. And as a result of it, we see more need for rate. We're not going to get into our individual state strategy for competitive reasons. In those states where things have been heating up on the loss side, we have been getting more rate. And again, on an overall basis, we look at the line and we make very thoughtful overall decisions. At the end of the day, it also boils down to individual risk decisions. And so going into guaranteed cost versus loss responsive, I guess the one comment I would make is the larger loss responsive buyers in terms of economic impact, that business gets impacted both based on payroll as well as losses. And as loss experience in general for the line, frequency is wrapped in on some of those larger risks. So that large loss response business for the ease [ph] under management, that's where the pressure came from, as exposure was down even more on the larger loss responsive business. But coupled -- look at that trend now, that is actually starting to bottom out as well. We're starting to see the large loss responsive business starting to flatten out on the exposure side as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer: Just first question on the direct-to-consumer business in Personal lines, about three points it looked like, three expense ratio points there. It's a bit more than last year. Can you just kind of talk about how that buildout strategy works? Is it kind of a stair-step function as you allocate resources? Or was that advertising that you kind of paid upfront in the fourth quarter?\nJay Fishman: Those questions are actually more specific than even -- not that I'm not willing to respond, but we're capable of responding to. This is a long-term program and it will take years for us to develop a direct-to-consumer business that meets our own profitability and return thresholds. We are still in the early stages of the learnings that we have to go through. Those learnings extend all the way from how to drive a customer somewhere, whether to a call center or at a website, and then how to get them through the process, convert to a quote and then convert to a sale. So these are just the -- they remain the early days and the loss that we're experiencing in that business is about what we expected it would be because that's how we're planning it. We're actually -- our mindset is to incur that loss, which is necessary to maximize the learnings from the experience. And so it's really driven more by what do we have to learn than we have to of what do we need to spend. The encouraging thing -- and there are some encouraging things. The encouraging thing that we've discovered about the direct-to-consumer business is that we're increasingly pleased with the customer that's responding to The Travelers solicitation, whether that's through direct mail or digital media or through a broad-based media. We weren't sure what kind of customer -- we understood generally, at least we thought we did, what kind of customer responded to the existing direct-to-consumer businesses, but we weren't sure what our brand name and our value proposition brought to the market and, therefore, who the customers were who would respond and who the customers were from a socioeconomic perspective that would ultimately respond to the proposal. We're encouraged by that. What we're seeing are young versions -- at least we think what we're seeing are young versions of our future independent agent customer. And that just fits hand in glove. So we're at the early stages of it and we will lose that which is necessary to keep the learnings moving in the right direction and maximize the long term business opportunity.\nMichael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer: And then just one question, Bill, if I could. Back to munies just for a second. Where would that -- I realize most of the movement in pricing in the fourth quarter was rate-related driven by Treasuries. Where would that be today, like if we were to think about where that sort of mark would be today given some of the volatility, at least so far this quarter? And then if you think about that book and these potentially just temporary rate or technically-driven price changes, how does that impact your thought process around buybacks, if at all?\nWilliam Heyman: Well, in terms of where the portfolio is this month, it would be hard for me to make a guess. My guess is very little change because most of the appreciation or depreciation is correlated to Treasuries. So on the 24th of the month, I wouldn't hazard an estimate of the month-to-date progress.\nJay Benet: As far as the buybacks, it really doesn't factor into our discussion about buybacks at all. We don't -- as I said before, we don't take great pleasure in seeing the unrealized gains in the portfolio at any particular level, and say, \"Gee, this is great. Let's go buy back more of our shares.\" And when change, it doesn't really enter into it.\nJay Fishman: Specifically, the mark-to-market in the bond portfolio, whether municipal or taxable, is not a capital item. It doesn't -- the mark-to-market positive does not add to capital and a mark-to-market negative did not delete from it. So we're driven very much by earnings and cash flow and the ability to realize excess capital from the balance sheet. That's what drives this.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse.\nVinay Misquith - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: The first question is for Bill Heyman. What percentage of your municipal bond portfolio do you actually manage to get quotes from the market? Or is it just really based on interest rates because it is a liquid market?\nWilliam Heyman: It's based on more than interest rates. In terms of what percentage we get dealer quotes, I wouldn't say. The portfolio is 90-something percent in I guess what is called Level Two pricing, whatever that implies, which is sometimes dealer quotes. For what it's worth, we have a lot of confidence in the liquidity of this portfolio. We rarely see these bonds put up -- much of what we own put up for sale. And when we do, when it's an attractive price, we snap it up. We think, similarly, if we had to realize liquidity from it, even on a large scale, it would not be very difficult.\nVinay Misquith - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Second question is on the Personal Lines. You've managed to improve the profitability in 2010 versus 2009. Where do you see your profitability going in 2011, both on the Homeowners and on the Auto side?\nJay Fishman: I think -- I'll ask Greg to comment, but I think we've already answered the question, which is we actually expect widening margins, meaning lower combined ratios in both the Auto as well as the Homeowners business, driven by earned rate gains that will exceed loss trend. But is there anything specific you want to add to that?\nGreg Toczydlowski: And the only thing I'd add is that's obviously based on the loss trends that we're watching today that has so much to do with miles driven. And as those things change, we'll change our pricing philosophy also, but those are the assumptions we're working with right now.\nBrian MacLean: And weather will be weather.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes.\nJay Fishman: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill & Partners.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners, L.P.: Do you think you're gaining share in Personal Lines, to focus on that little bit, or is it exposure gains? And if you are gaining share, and it does look like that to me, could you maybe think about or talk about where it's coming from in that business?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, absolutely. This is Greg Toczydlowski. We do believe we're gaining market share, when you look at our unit growth and our topline growth. And when we look at the source of that business, we look at that at a very local level. So there's over 1,000 competitors in this marketplace, so we have regional players. But predominantly, when we look at the Agency business or even in the direct channel, the thrust of our new business is coming from non-independent agency-type carriers. And again, we watch that very locally and we'll continue to do that, but we feel good about our market share expansion in that product line.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners, L.P.: Non-agency independent, that's basically career agencies, is that right?\nJay Fishman: It could be captive, it would be career, it could be direct. But when we look at our new business flow and we ask who the prior carrier is, and that is an underwriting question that we ask, a significant percentage are moving from non-independent agency channels, direct captives, career such, into the independent agent channel.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners, L.P.: I may be just missing something, but completely separately, I was looking at sort of the other investment category, this may be a Jay Benet question, and it looked like the book yield fell significantly but the gross investment losses were up significantly. Am I sort of missing something? Is there some reason why the book yield would go a different direction?\nGabriella Nawi: Maybe I'll take that offline with you. We're not sure we understand the question here. So maybe we can get to the next question and I'll give you a call after the call?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.\nLarry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: I guess my simple question is, what's your level of confidence that what you saw in the fourth quarter in Business Insurance really marked kind of an inflection in the operating environment?\nJay Fishman: No declarations here, Larry. Sorry. One quarter does not a trend make. It's interesting. It's encouraging. It's consistent with the strategy that we brought to the market. But our share of the business, while significant, is not sufficiently large to be a price leader. And so we do what we do and competitors react and they'll react independently and we'll see where we go. I don't know.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay. Operator, this would be the last question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: The first is, when you look at the claims frequency, and you've described the environment as still fairly accommodating, are you seeing any early signs of a change there? That obviously has been a pretty important factor in the profitability.\nBrian MacLean: The short answer is nothing.\nJay Fishman: I'm looking at Brian because two really separate questions. We experienced a number of years where frequency was declining in many lines of business, and over a period of time here that has leveled out. So I certainly would not say to you that frequency is continuing to decline. It may, but it's not what we're seeing at the moment. What we are broadly seeing, and it's very much a function of individual line and product, is flattening of frequency. I don't know, other than in the little area that Bill Cunningham was speaking about in workers comp, if there's anything. And even that was small by -- just trying to be very thoughtful about the response.\nBrian MacLean: But to your point, a couple years ago comp frequency was falling from that. And that clearly has mitigated. But for the last year, it's been very stable.\nJay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: The other question was on exposure and I'm wondering what are the key things driving it. I'm assuming it's mostly just payroll and revenues at your insureds going up?\nBrian MacLean: The biggest driver is business receipts and the second driver is payroll. So most of our liability products are rated off of business receipts. And as those have rebounded -- and actually the right words would be as those were falling less throughout 2010, the exposure change was less negative and it's back up to a slight, slight positive. And then payroll is a piece of it.\nJay Fishman: It's important to remember, Jay, though, that these are estimates that our insureds are making about the next 12 months. So at policy renewal, they make estimates of payroll and sales and square footage and trucks on the road. And so the first thing that we're seeing here, interestingly, is a change in the sense of optimism about the insureds themselves. They see a projected change in exposure. Then, of course, we come back in at the end of the policy period, we do an audit, and we make a determination of what the actual exposures were, we bill accordingly. We have had negative audit premiums for the last several years, which really speaks to how rapidly and how deep the decline in the economy was, because it actually exceeded the expectations that the insureds have. So now, sort of first derivative, interesting to see that insureds are beginning to have a different view of what their business prospects are. And now, we'll see ultimately what their real numbers end up being as the months go on and we're able to go back and begin to do audits. And if we get back to historical patterns, most importantly, if we get back to historical patterns, we would expect to end up with positive audit premium billings because customers tend to understate their exposures. At least historically that's been a true pattern. Now we'll see how insightful our customers really are.\nOperator: Ms. Nawi, I will now turn the call back over to you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you very much for joining us today. Of course, as always, Andy Hersom and I are available in Investor Relations for any follow-up questions. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded today Thursday, October 23, 2010. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may now begin.\nGabriella Nawi:  Thank you Frank. Good morning and welcome to Travelers discussion of our third quarter 2010 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the investor section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation and then we will open it for questions. Before I turn it to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website, travelers.com. With that out of the way, here is Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Well thank you Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our third quarter results, having posted net income of $2.11 per share, an increase of 28% over last year and operating income of $1.81 per share, a 12% increase over last year's amount Operating return on equity was a strong 14.3% and we experienced very solid underwriting results across each of our business segments. Our consolidated GAAP combined ratio was 19.6%. In an insurance pricing environment that remains largely flat in the commercial businesses, we were pleased to produce an increase of 2% net written premiums for the quarter. Investment returns remained reduced from historical patterns as remarkably low interest rates, particularly short rates continue to impact net investment income. Lastly we've grown our book value from year-end 2009 by 13% to $59.11, a in a very strong quarter. This morning we're going to do things a bit differently than we have in previous quarters. All of the data that we have historically provided is still included in our webcast. However we're only going to hit the highlights and you can review the details on your own and obviously Gabby is available later to take any questions you may have. Instead, we're going to take the opportunity to share a few additional insights into our business that we think you'll find interesting. First, we've spoken at length in previous presentations about our program's design to grow our business organically. This morning we're going to share with you summery analytics of our business insurance account growth and we suspect that a number of you will be surprised with the growth we've achieved. Second, a number of you have asked about the impact of reduced interest rates on our net investment income. Jay Benet shared an analysis of the impact of reinvestment rates at an investor conference in September and we've updated it for current conditions. We've analyzed the maturities in our fixed income portfolio for the next three years and we'll share with you the projected impact on net investment income if re investment rates remain at current levels. The municipal bond environment remains a topic of some interest. We've updated an analysis of our municipal bond portfolio that we did for the second quarter webcast based on current ratings and market conditions. As we've said before, it is an actively managed portfolio where we are constantly evaluating risk and return of individual securities. There are never any guarantees but we couldn't be more pleased with the positioning of the portfolio. Finally, before I turn it over to Jay Benet, I want to comment on a topic that we're thinking about regularly. As we've discussed before we believe the most thoughtful way to run a property casualty business for the long term is to produce superior returns on equity. As many of your understand, we can't promise consistent growth in either revenues or earnings and do so maintaining a thoughtful risk profile. Consequently a number of years ago consistent with our aspiration for superior returns on equity and given what we viewed as typical underwriting and investment environments. We determined that we will target a mid-teens return on equity overtime and do so by achieving top tier profitability and returning access capital to shareholders. Two very important origin that previous sentence are overtime. Since January 2005 the first full year after the merger of St. Paul and Travelers, our average annual operating return on equity is 14.1%, then we have recorded more than $20 billion in operating income and have returned nearly $17 billion in total shareholders, $13 billion in share repurchases and nearly $4 billion in dividends. Given the current general economic and investment environments few people have asked whether we intend to change our goal now. We are certainly not economists nor do we what the future holds. However, the underlying assumption we are making is that the economy will eventually return to a more typical investment environment particularly with respect to the fixed income world. Consequently we are not changing our goal now, having said that we have been very clear in the recent past that the current environment simply doesn't permit achievement of a consistent mid-teens return right now if one assumes no favorable reserve development and normal catastrophes in weather costs. If in fact the market ultimately presents long term meaningfully reduced investment returns not only for us but also for the market at large which for us are not offset by improved underwriting conditions. We will obviously rethink what that means for our aspirations and what investors can expect of us. So for now our target remains intact and we continue to execute in the marketplace consistent with that goal. We seek rate selectively and thoughtfully where weight is needed especially in those cases where account loss experience has been inconsistent with our underwriting expectations. But we are always managing rate and retention with a clear view of maximizing long term value to our arbitrarily and aggressively seek rate and be a victim of adverse selection and watch our retention drop perfidiously will not be a smart or thoughtful reaction to the current environment. As Brian will explain in greater detail our field people take their lead from us and right now their direction is unambiguous. We feel great about how they are executing and we believe that we will continue to be amongst the best performing property and casualty companies around. With that let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jay, I would like to start with a few overall comments about the quarter relating to page four through 10 of the webcast. Operating results ex-cap and favorable reserve development and including net investment income were generally inline with our expectations as they have been all year. The third quarter results benefited from a relatively low level caps a $117 million pre-tax which was lower than prior year CAT losses of a 158 million pre-tax as well as what we \u201cnormally planned for in the third quarter\u201d. I would remind you though that year-to-date CAT losses have been quite high over a $1 billion on a pre-tax basis as compared to 441 million pre-tax in the first nine months of last year which would approximate a more normal year-to-date amount. We had another quarter of net favorable prior year reserve development in each of our segments concentrated this quarter in DI and FPII. The quarters reserve development included and asbestos reserve increase of a $140 million pre-tax. Included in this asbestos reserve increase and therefore in the current quarters operating income was a $70 million pre-tax benefited related to the recent favorable ruling we received against Munich Re and certain members of (inaudible). The total awarded to us by the court in this ruling was $417 million, broken down as follows, $251 million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement and interest of $166 million. Based upon this ruling, we reduced our uncollectible reinsurance reserve by $70 million, thereby reflecting in our financial statements the full $251 million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement. Importantly the benefit of the $166 million interest award was not reflected in either the current quarter asbestos charge or in the current quarter's operating income since GAAP requires its interest to be treated as a contingent gain generally until all appeals have been exhausted and or the dollar amount is received. All of our capital leverage and liquidity measures remained at or better than target levels. We are holding company liquidity at $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which was more than twice the target level due to the timing of share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies for our holding company. During the third quarter we repurchased $600 million of our common shares, a higher amount than we would normally repurchase in the third quarter due to the strength of our balance and the light wind season we have experienced thus far and paid $169 million in common stock dividends bringing the total cash we returned to our shareholders in the past nine months to almost $4 billion. Third quarter operating ROE was 14.3% and book value for share once again increased, up 6% in the quarter and up 15% from a year ago. Page 4 makes reference to our very high quality investment portfolio which includes a $4.6 billion pre-tax net unrealized gain at the end of the third quarter; up significantly from the $2.8 billion pre-tax net unrealized gain we recorded at the beginning of the year. A little over 60% of the net unrealized gain relates to the muni bond portfolio. Page 5 provides an update of certain data we previously provided to you related to our muni bond portfolio. There have not been any significant changes in the portfolio recently, not withstanding our active management of the portfolio based upon a risk reward view for each individual holding due to its very high quality. The portfolio currently includes bonds that have gross unrealized gains of $2.8 billion pre-tax and bonds that have gross unrealized losses of only $8 million. That's right, only $8 million of losses, not billions. I'd also like to make some specific comments related to page 9 of the webcast. During a presentation I made at a recent conference, I referred to today's low interest rate environment and provided an illustration based upon our portfolio schedule bond maturities in 2011, 2012 and 2013 of the impact on net investment income in those years. If the current interest rate environment persists through this period of time and all of the variables such as average assets, mix, credit quality and duration remain constant. The illustration I provided at the conference was based upon reinvesting a 10 year rate or approximately 100 basis points lower than the combined yield on the maturing bonds, rounding the interest rate differential to the nearest 50 basis points. Since then interest rates have fallen even further and we have updated the illustration to reflect a 150 basis point interest rate decline. We've also added another line to the illustration which shows the differential between NII and the subsequent years. Again all other variables being held constant that includes the partial year impact of reinvesting 2010 maturities at lower interest rates. The full year impact of this activity will not be felt until 2011 in subsequent years since 2010 maturities will have taken place throughout 2010 rather than on the first day of the year. As you model these years I would also remind you that NII will also be impacted by the reduction and average invested assets that results from our share repurchase program and with that let me give the mike over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks Jay. Our typical disclosures on the business segment is also around pages 11 through 22 and we will of course take questions on any topic. Instead of going through the slides I will give a few perspectives on our businesses and the marketplace. In business insurance we continue to be very pleased with the positioning of our franchisee. Both our account retention and flow of new business opportunities remain near historically high levels which we believe will enable us to grow premiums if and when the economy improves. Core underwriting margins continue to contract modestly in the quarter consistent with both prior quarters and our expectations. In short the loss cost trend slightly outpaced through the rate changes. We continue to see the negative impact as the economy is having on our insured exposures. Audit premiums which are retroactive premium adjustments charged to reflect changes and insured pay roll, vehicles, property values or business receipts have improved but are still negative. The exposure change on renewals which is a perspective look has also improved throughout the year and is now approaching zero. On a combined basis these impacts are reducing premiums approximately 2% through the third quarter. So in another word our data suggest that the economy is bottoming out but we don't see any evidence at current economic expansion. Given these trends our underwriting strategy remains consistent. Retain our quality business, optimize the profitability on this retained book by getting rate where it is warranted and write new business for long term profitable growth. Directionally this strategy maybe the same as many of our competitors but aligning it with our competitive advantages namely our talent, technology, actionable management information and breadth of distribution, we believe we are very well positioned. Over the last seven quarters we have seen significant account growth and as a result we believe that we are growing market share. On slide 16, you can see that since year end 2008 we have grown accounts in business insurance by 8.5% compound annual growth rate. On the next slide we have taken this data and broken it out for two of our major businesses. In our small commercial business or select accounts you can see that it is growing by a 10.6% CAGR. This increase has been driven by our select express product that's our no touch insurance solution for small business customers. Through the combination of our sophisticated rating capability and cost efficient frontline delivery we are able to provide our agents and customers with an industry leading product and platform. Within select in the plus end or the larger end of this market we have allowed our accounts to be decreased due to extremely competitive market conditions. On the slide you can also see that we have grown commercial accounts by 4.4% compound annual growth rate. The increase in the number of accounts in this business is driven primarily by the continued introduction of the new products and the specialization and expertise of these products and our front line underwriting and claim staff bring to the marketplace. This growth in commercial accounts is representative of what we are seeing across our middle market businesses. So we're encouraged by this increase in the number of accounts and again if and when the economy improves the resulting impact on exposure should create a compelling written premium trend. Given both this top line dynamic and the current core underwriting profitability of this book of business, we remain very pleased with business insurance current performance and its position in the marketplace moving forward. In the financial professional and international segment, I will make just a few overall comments. First, writings in our international businesses are down compared to prior year quarter as we are addressing risk in pricing in light of catastrophe and other severe weather losses over the past year. Secondly, although we remain very pleased with the market position and quality of our construction surety business. The impact of the economy on construction spending has resulted in fewer new business opportunities and are writings in this quarter reflect this. And lastly, we continue to monitor the analysis on impacts of the financial marketplace disruptions on our management liability business and our conclusions remain the same. That is our losses are developing within or slightly favorable to our expectations. Turning to personnel insurance, we're extremely pleased with both the underwriting and production results in the quarter. In both agency, auto and property policies in force continue to grow and core underwriting margins expanded as earned rate increases outpaced loss cost trends. In our property line of business, weather losses were both less than third quarter expectations and a welcome relief from the pattern we saw in the first half of the year. While the continental U.S. was not meaningfully impacted by any of the storms generated during the peak of the hurricane season, the number of near misses this quarter highlights the importance of underwriting controls and risk management policies in this business. Agency property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market with quarter-over-quarter pip growth remaining at historically high levels. In agency auto our new business continued to improve and we had our best quarter-over-quarter policies in force increase since the end of 2008 Given the continued expansion in core underwriting margins and strong top line trends, we remain pleased with both our current and going forward positions in these businesses. So across all of our businesses we feel great about our execution in the marketplace and one the primary reasons we believe our organization has executed so well in these times of uncertainty is that we have kept our message to the field clear, unambiguous and consistent. And that is and in these market conditions, just like pretty much any other, the role of our underwriters is to maximize the long term value of the portfolio to balance the desire to keep our quality business well at the same time optimizing the returns on that portfolio. Fundamentally, they do that by making sure they understand the accounts risk characteristics and can estimate the potential losses from these exposures. They then seek the select risks in the marketplace where the premium level is appropriate for this view of the losses. We believe our field understands their role as the best tools in the business to execute and as long as they keep doing this we will keep competing in the marketplace successfully. With that, let me turn it back over to Jay.\nJay Fishman: Thanks Brian. Page 23 summarizes our updated guidance for full year 2010 fully diluted operating income per share which we've increased from the previous range of $5.20 to a range of $5.75 to $5.95. In round numbers this should translate into an operating ROE of just under 12%. We're now assuming cut losses of $765 million after tax or $1.58 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual catalogue for the first nine months of the year and our original estimate for the fourth quarter. No further estimates of prior reserve development either favorable or unfavorable, a low single digit decrease in average invested assets, ex-unrealized gains and losses this whole thing from a reduction of holding company with liquidity due to the share repurchases. Full year share repurchases of 4.5 to 5 billion and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases and employee equity awards of approximately 485 million shares. Jay would like to say some additional comments before we go to Q&A.\nJay Benet:  Thanks Jay. Just before we open it up we had a pretty good run here for sometime and the folks around this table I think actually get an undue amount of credit for that performance. We have publicly acknowledged all the folks of the investment department, we have done a remarkable job in unprecedented conditions of keeping this company moving ahead but the fact is I want and our own folks listen to these calls and I just want to spend 15 seconds letting 10,000 people know that we recognize that the business is done in the field and trade at a time and we couldn't be more appreciative of the underwriting discipline and the thoughtfulness and your attention. And I don't care whether their commercial lines underwriters or personal underwriters, but they refrain the technology or opts risk control. This is a complicated business I mean by 30,000 folks who understand it to keep the organization moving ahead and I just wanted to take a minute and say thanks and with that we are ready to go for questions.\nOperator:  Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Keith Walsh from Citi. Please proceed.\nKeith Walsh - Citi:  Hey, good morning everybody. I guess first for Brian on auto, I guess a lots of talk in the industry about positive rate trends. So, why the decision here to loosen in terms of conditions with the 12 month product and also if you can comment on the direct initiative where we stand and I have got a follow-up. Thanks.\nGreg Toczydlowski:  Hey Keith this is Greg Toczydlowski from Personal Insurance. On the annual policy first of all take that one. There is a number of dynamics that we look at and the annual policy. Some of them being agency selling behavior, retention and pricing and we look at all those dynamics together we thought it was the appropriate time to drive that inside the business and I think the margins and the growth are showing that. That's clearly not the only feature that we have been throwing out there into the market as a positive impact. And when we look at all them we feel good about having that in the product.\nBrian MacLean:  I will just make an observation on that agency costs matter very much in the equation too and instead of yielding obviously two rules a year you deal with one not an insignificant difference. On the direct initiative you don't actually have lots to say, we continue on course with the plan that we set. We said we are going to be investing and losing money and in fact we are on positive sides. We are beginning to learn a fair amount about the customers that respond. What they find attractive in the value equation and I will let you know if are doing about 5000 policies a month in our direct initiative now. So we are on our way to learning but make no mistake we view it as a very long term investment.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Okay and then Jay just a follow-up on pricing I mean I acknowledge your comments that you said, the ROEs has been very strong last several years but the chart show clear price deterioration and why the continued focus on growing in certain business lines here when clearly the accident of your ROE is probably sub 10 at this point. Thanks.\nJay Fishman: I think the second half of your question or the statement is actually just in error. We look at a lot of data. In fact I'm not sure anyone analyses data any better or more robustly than we and I will tell you that even assuming current reinvestment rates now, current reinvestment rates now, the portfolio, meaning the combination of renewal and new, on our business insurance business is not in single digits. It's actually better than that. Now the dynamic is we're focused on -- and I hope my comments really were fairly specific about this, we are focused on retention and I would say taking new business selectively. No one should come to the conclusion that we are focused on growth. There isn't anything in the comments or in the data that would give anyone -- should point anyone to the conclusion that we're focusing on growth as the word you use. It is a very selective approach. It is not only based on price but its risk selection. We spend most of the time on these calls speaking about rate. Our folks in the (inaudible) spend most of their time focused on the risk selection. So it's as I said a complex business where you're balancing elements. I just couldn't be more pleased with how we're managing through this largely unprecedented environment.\nKeith Walsh - Citi: Okay, thanks for clarifying.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Two questions. I'll just ask both and let you guys address them. The first is Brian I think you mentioned that your kind of core combined ratio in business insurance have gotten worse but it looks like its gotten better and I'm wondering what's driving that, that ex development, ex catastrophes. And then secondly, maybe for Jay Fishman, when you think about your ROE, are you making any adjustments for your own cost of equity capital and given the changes interest rates presumably that has come down as well.\nBrian MacLean: So first on the combined ratio and I'll throw it to Jay Benet for some of the specifics but obviously every quarter there is stuff running through the combined. We still see when we net out everything that we think is unusual a slight deterioration in what we call the core combined ratio. But Jay, why don't you go through some of the changes.\nJay Benet: Yeah Jay, in any period, a period comparison we try to look at as Brian said what are the key core underlying trends of price and loss cost but there are also things that will impact it. Small weather, not cut weather in quarter versus another year-to-date, one year versus another; we've talked in the past about large loss activity. Last year we made a re-estimation of the full year loss pick for business insurance in the fourth quarter. We also did that in the third quarter but when you do that it impacts prior quarters of the current year. So I think when you see the full year results, you'll see more of what Brian is talking about and if there are impacts associated with large loss activity and small weather we'll try to point that out as well.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That makes sense. Thanks.\nJay Fishman: In terms of the return on equity, it's actually an awfully simple story. The return on equity that we publish in our press release and in our financials is straightforward GAAP return on equity which is the earnings that we reported for the period divided by average equity for the period and Jay and Doug can take you through all of that. We obviously understand that if our entire $70 billion investment portfolio were re-priced today at today's reinvestment rates, that we would end up with a different return. We understand that, internally the analytics that we have we actually do look at it that way. We actually do evaluate products and businesses and lines based upon investing cash flows at today's available rates and it's those analytics that form the basis of our pricing strategy and our growing strategy and they are proprietary. They are important, they are the subject of substantial discussion here and it's that return that gives us our approach to whether we are aggressively growing, not aggressively growing or willing to strength. Brian spoke today about letting the large end of select strength because we are pricing with such and the risk selection effect that the returns are simply aren't adequate to support business. So we are letting that shrink somewhat. And certainly we understand one of the reasons that Jay presented the schedule that he did about investment income is that if these investment markets continue. If they are what they are and the underwriting environment never changes and there is no favorable development. Now we are not going to be able to achieve mid-teens return on equity and we certainly understand that and it's actually not all that difficult to model out the business and see what you think it is. We certainly do it all the time and it can be achieved. So we talk pretty simple, the numbers that you get in press release and GAAP things we are all getting and internally we have robust analytics that left us evaluate the current underwriting profitability based up on today's reinvestment rate and that's what establishes our underwriting energy or enthusiasm.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I appreciate. I guess my question really surrounded the hurdle way what you need, in another words if you are comparing your ROE versus your own cost of equity capital if that cost of capital has come down shouldn't the hurdle rate comedown as well naturally.\nJay Benet:  Well that actually gets to the comments that I made and is just absolutely spot on. There has at least in my career never been a period with a gap between the cost of debt and the cost of equity has been any wider than it is today. I find it actually remarkable that they are high quality equities with the dividend is actually higher than the debt yield on the ten year debt, high quality companies. So it tells you that the market place is at the moment somewhat upside down and the real question that you are asking and I think it's extra-ordinarily relevant one is that is going to continue and possibly been in an environment where the two year treasury is a 2.4% and the cost of equity is a 10 or will there not be arbitrage activities that will take place. But in one fashion or another we will lower that gap, reduce that gap into a more normal historical rage. We are extremely attentive to it. One can speculate that one way that cost of equity will go down is a rising equity market and some folks have asked me why do you think the market is generally is rising now. One of the answers to it is that it's reflecting at a decline cost of equity. It's somewhat kind of intuitive to think of it that way but frankly it's entirely possible. So, I don't know what the cost of equity will be in a few years. My guess is that you got a financial company ten years from now in today's environment and you look back three years from now and the company has achieved a 10% cumulative return on equity and you will feel great. You won't feel good, you will feel great and if you look broadly at the financial services arena and we do and I do and you will look at the returns that institutions of producing particularly in the banking arena where the rules and regulations and levels of dynamics are changing so much I think that the dynamic of what returns are going to be over the next few years is a fascinating question and what it is that investors are going to seek but my comment was for now our goal is our goal. We will do the best we can. We are not going at arbitrarily and go out through the marketplace and say, the worst thing in the world to do is to go out to the marketplace and say we want five points of rate on every account. You'll get five points of rate on accounts that need 10 and you'll lose accounts that don't need any. The easiest way to get adverse selection is to take away the underwriters authority to evaluate risk and return on an individual trade. So no mystery here. We acknowledge the environment is not possible right now, nothing we can achieve with these returns. But the two words overtime are just critical to us and that's how we think about. This is a long term business and we manage it over time.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great, thanks Jay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Yeah, good morning. Two questions here. First one, I was hoping Jay if you could talk about the general administrative expenses in the business and circuited the big, big drop this quarter. Anything unusual going on there and I have one follow-up.\nJay Fishman: I'm going to sound like I'm repeating myself a little bit from Jay Cohen's question but as it relates to the expenses and again in any quarter you can have some things go up and some things go down. I think last year we had some assessments that came through in the third quarter. This year we had some credits that came through in the third quarter. I think overall that we've been very thoughtful in trying to manage our expenses and keep the expense ratio in line and those are kinds of things that have created the period to period variability but there is nothing in particular from an operational standpoint that's driving it. We do have differences and timing of things like advertising cost and travel that go through. So I can't think of anything in particular that I'd point to that says this is a fundamental change.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Is there like an underlying rate we can think about that our expense is kind of flat or are down a little bit. Just trying to kind of think about it going forward. I don't want to essentially drop expenses by 10% a quarter here going forward.\nJay Fishman: That's I would say relatively flat, particularly if you look at it on an expense ratio basis.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Okay, okay. Terrific. And then the second question for Brian, lost cost inflation in the commercial lines area, we've heard a little bit this quarter about some tick up and some loss costs inflation from some other companies. I'm wondering what you're seeing.\nBrian MacLean: So splitting it into two pieces, frequency for us has been very flat and granted that is compared to last year and the year before where we were having some significant declines in frequency and in some of our businesses. So the declines have leveled off but we're still pretty pleased with where they are leveling off at. The core loss inflation or severity component of it is pretty benign. It's not a zero. It's a plus number. But it's a mid to low single digits plus number. So overall loss inflation continues to be in a pretty good place for us.\nBrian Meredith - UBS: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant from KBW. Please proceed.\nCliff Gallant - KBW: Good morning. Two questions. First, pretty simple, there was recent news about Chinese Drywall in a settlement that looks like state farm was reaching. I was wondering if you had any comment on or an update on your view on Chinese Drywall and then second, I was wondering if you can to speculate on a sort of a larger basis, what you think the industry accident year combined ratios are or should the industry actually here the combined ratios, should the industry exit your ROEs look like in comparison to what you are reporting.\nJay Benet:  We have enough trouble keeping track of our own. We are going to pass on try and estimate what the industry is.\nDoreen Spadorcia:  Good morning This is Doreen. I will take your Chinese Drywall question. Bottom-line we haven't seen anything that would cause us to change our view that we talked about previously. I think we showed you slide in the first quarter. We just don't think it creates a significant exposure to us and basically what's changed the first quarter as we have probably got a few more insured that had made claims against us and that on the positive side we actually had a ruling in the District Court in Virginia finding that our home owners policy is not provide coverage for Chinese Drywall. The State Farm settlement, there has been some multi-district issues, there are two cases pending that have a lot of class action plaintiffs as well as a number of defendant. And some companies that have had large home owner populations have chosen to participate with some of those settlements where you have seen some of the Chinese Drywall manufacturers and some distributors putting in some dollars but for us we have not participated in those given where our exposure is and the positive ruling that we received.\nCliff Gallant - KBW: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann from JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan:  Hi. Good morning everybody. Two questions, first could you give us a little bit more color on the BI account growth slide you showed. I guess I will be curious when whether or not there is a dramatic difference in accounts size for the new accounts versus maybe the existing book if you go back to year end '08. And also just given what we have seen in premium, could you maybe just discuss how the exposure trends at those new accounts maybe contrast with exposure trend change on the existing book and then I will have a follow-up.\nJay Fishman:  For starters on the mix dynamic within the account growth, what we try to break out the small commercial from the middle market and obviously the small commercial. We are absolutely growing it from a mixed perspective in the smaller array. So, that's driving some of the dynamic of the total but within that the express component of small commercial which would have a fairly consistent account sizes growing dramatically. So we feel good about that.\nJay Benet: And importantly just in other terms, Select Express is the technology platform that we introduce now I don't know maybe three years ago and that has really dramatically changed the way what smallest end of our small commercial business is processed. I have discussed this before but the predecessor platform was 20% underwritten in the technology, 80% was referred out to underwriters for review. This is a very slow approach to the smallest end of the business, 80% now is done in the technology and only 20% comes out for human intervention. So it is dramatically different, this platform is the basis of the flow significant increase in quote activity that we have seen from ages. We are just been quoted a whole lot more with this platform because it's easier and more efficient and as a result that business is growing significantly. It is the smallest end of the small commercial business.\nJay Fishman: And I think Matt and correct me if I am wrong, just to your question are we getting the growth just because we are shifting mix or do we think we are actually growing like type of accounts and the answer is there is a piece of it that's mixed but the bulk of it is we're growing light type of accounts. So.\nJay Benet: Yes, in the middle businesses, the average account size that we're bringing in that was fairly consistent with our renewal book of business and the difference between the total gross is basically the exposure, the audit premium and the renewal exposure change that you're increasing your overview.\nBrian MacLean: And help me a little bit with the second half of what you are asking.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: You got to it with the last comment. So that's helpful. The other question I had was, I need to follow up on Brian, actually maybe I'll ask a different one, on the direct side, I guess are you out of -- you used the -- I think you used the word experiment Jay but it looks like the premium volume is starting to decelerate sequentially kind of low to mid $20 million on a quarterly basis. You would expect that to grow I would assume but I guess are you proactively kind of trying to restrain the growth in that channel till you ensure you kind of understand the dynamics or you are now at a point where growth will be what it will be, you kind of have a more clear view of the appetite and some of the variables that you want to pay attention to.\nJay Fishman: I'll give you my perspective and I'll Greg to chime in as well. It's sure closer to the former than the later. We're actually -- I wouldn't say constraining. That's not quite the word but what we are doing is we're only doing that amount of business that we need to do to continue to advance the learning and the learnings are how do we get a customer to respond to an ad, how do we get that customer either through our call center or our technology platform to actually end up with quote, how do we convert that quote to a sale and then most importantly, who are we bringing in and what's the loss experience. What we -- you've said -- the pricing track we're using for direct is the same pricing track we use at our agency plant. It is our presumption that the loss experience between those two groups will be different, that the act of where one purchases is an identifying characteristic -- a projecting characteristic of loss experience. So we're just trying to do enough to keep the learnings moving ahead. We are not remotely at the level now where its goal, invest in advertising dramatically, or whatever we can do, we can do. If you can add to that.\nGreg Toczydlowski: I'd just echo Jay's comments. We spend a lot of time watching the economics and the operational expectations of the business and they're both right within the target of where we want to be. As Jay said, the function of the top line is how we advertise, how we entertain ourselves out in the digital space and clearly that's the amount of investment that we put in this. I think it's a fair assumption that if you look at the last three quarter's run rate, that's a fair assumption of what we could expect for this business to continue running at both months going forward and as Jay said we're really trying to really maximize our learning with minimizing the investments inside this business and as we get more of those learning's we'll continue to grow the business. We're very cautious in how we're doing it.\nJay Fishman: We didn't characterize it by the way as an experiment. The implication of that is that we're committed to making this work and it will take years -- it will take years for us to get to the point where it gets to break even or frankly becomes profitable but we are committed to getting there and what we're doing is to Greg's exact point, is balancing the cost of investment with the value of the learnings that come out of it.\nMatthew Heimermann - JPMorgan: Okay, that's fair. That was my poor word choice. I guess based on your last comment and isn't it fair to kind of think about quantum has a parallel in terms of -- because I think there was about a 24 month period of kind of rolling that out and to the point where you were kind of fully comfortable just letting it run. So it sounds be much longer.\nBrian MacLean:  Yeah it takes much longer than that. Yes.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital:  Thank you. I want to ask a broader picture of question on the situation with the bank dislocation with regard to mortgage servicing. Could you talk about how or what the implications might be from the insurance side on that from a Directors and Officers and Arizona's mission perspective as well as what the implications could be for Travelers investment portfolio. Thanks.\nJay Fishman:  Let me take the first piece of that related to the insurance business. It's early days and when I say early days I mean in the context that we are still learning about the facts and circumstances and so it's hard to really come up with a definitive insurance exposure perspective in that environment but having said that you are taking a look at our exposure to the top 15 mortgage services and our exposure is really very, very limited there and that is in some respects of fall out of the credit crisis underwriting we have been doing going back to the first to second quarter of 2007. So all the big names that you and we have been reading about in the news, we have very, very limited exposure there. We don't view it as an exposure really to the community banks and we think that's because they just haven't been foreclosing the kinds of volumes that would involve the processes that is really in question here and we haven't seen any indication if that's the case. So at least early days from the insurance perspective we are not doing it as an outside issue.\nJay Benet:  On the investment side just suppose to couple of facts. First our entire portfolio of subprime and also ABS is are actually $300 million and $200 million of that was 2004 and prior and we have added $100 million selectively since the crisis began. So, not a significant investment there, still very highly rated. On the residential CMO side that $2.3 billion of that again virtually all 2004 and prior we turned away from the market as both the mortgage market and the real estate market really heated up. 862 million of it is agency and 1.4 billion is non-agency. The facts and circumstances of this what actually is happening and the implications are as confusing as I have ever seen it, and it's not at all clear what the long term issue really is. If we are talking about episodic relatively short term delays in foreclosure activity, our assessment is no problem with respect to the investments and we have already seen some of that episodic short term delay. And the other extreme is the notion of a long term industry wide broad-based foreclosure moratorium. We don't know how to access that, I don't know how to access some thing that actually has never happened before and frankly I think of all of the issues that will incur the impact of asset backed securities may actually be the smallest in that kind of environment. So I don't know to size up that kind of long term broad-based moratorium. Again the episodic short term stuff we could be wrong on this but our assessment is no underlying problem. With respect to the flip side of the issue which is the ability to put mortgages back to the originating institutions, of course the GFCs have always have had that. There is nothing particularly no on that front and again we could be wrong on this but our assessment has been that it's hard for us to figure out a scenario where mortgages get put back to the originating institution and the bond holders lose -- the originating institution seems to me it could be in a position to lose but we have some difficulty figuring out the scenario where the bond holder loses but early days on this would even be an understatement. It's right at the beginning. Bill?\nBill Cunningham: I wouldn't add much. You obviously read the story about Pimco and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sending to Bank of America with a list of 115 tools, where they would like to see mortgages put back. We looked at that list. We own three of them. We think -- I think there are three cross currants. One the validity of foreclosures which have taken place, two the ability on our perspective basis to foreclose and courts are beginning to get more particular in terms of what they demand and that's probably good. And three the whole put back phenomenon and they would cut differently across the portfolio. My guess is the probability of any of the three having a significant impact to us or anyone else, that might be more remote than the newspapers are suggesting and whatever happens is going to happen over time to the extent that if there was a put back phenomenon we would benefit. It's easier for GSEs to put back mortgages than non agency pools because all the GSEs have to do this pool they weren't confirming. So we'd be beneficiaries but we're not counting on much.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Thanks and that was very comprehensive. Just to circle back to the property casualty exposure, is there a standalone mortgage servicing E&O type of coverage that would be meant to respond to that or is that all sort of lumped into the in the E&O programs if there is availability for that these days.\nBill Cunningham: When we think about our exposure its way heavily weighted toward the D&O and E&O side and again underweight on the larger institutions. They is coverage that I think is available in that market. We just don't write a lot of it.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nVinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Hi good morning. On the personal order side, could you provide some color on your PIF growth in the agencies channel? Some of it by end that the direct way is the way to go and you seem to be growing in that channel pretty well.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Its Greg Toczydlowski again. We've been focused very much on a couple of areas. One that we talk about earlier is some of the features in the automobile is some of our geographic expansion. We've seen an under penetration in the mid-west and the west and we've been appointing agents out there over the past few years and based on those two really its been driving some of the sequential PIF growth that we have inside the book of business.\nVinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Okay, that's great. The second question is on pricing in the business insurance. It appears that you're happier to take maybe pricing is done just a tad just to keep your business and to grow a little. Just wanted your perspective on the risk to that strategy. We are at all time historical lows in terms of frequencies. Do you think that this is the right time maybe to grow your business?\nJay Fishman: Well I'll let Brian step in but I want to start off with the premise that the tactical and strategic imperative number one two and three is retention and again somehow the conversation always seems to kind of drive to growth but we start out with a focus that the book of business that we have is the book of business that we understand, that's priced appropriately that's got highest return and so we approach our retention book in a very, very thoughtful kind of way. The growth dynamics that you are seeing here in the charts, the account growth, I got to go back and talk to the fact that once been driven by Select Express which is a technology platform that lowers cost, lowers agent cost and lowers our cost significantly and so it's been a platform based dynamic of growth not price based. A platform based dynamic of growth and in Bill Cunningham's in his middle market business it's really been about new product development and role out. We have provided lots of information about that previously not a price driven strategy and again the data. It's so clear that it supports this, you are looking at retention that is historical highs and renewal pricing that's more or less a flat a little below or flat and so our focus is not and it destined to get confused to some folks is not to cut price too aggressively grow our book. It's to use our competitive advantages where they exist, like the express, like the new product development in middle market that allows us to the geography that Greg spoke about. Where there are ways to grow your business without being pricing competitive to do it.\nBrian MacLean: And then the other dynamic within pricing and you used the right words, I mean if you look at any of our business insurance statistics that are in the package. The negative price that we are talking about is it's somewhere around a negative one but and we have talked about this a lot in the past and Jay touched on it. It's the spread across the portfolio that really matters there. If we were getting minus one on each and every account that's one strategy, we have got accounts in here where we are getting plus 10s and we have got accounts that are certainly getting minus 10s. It's blending to something pretty close to neutral. We feel good about the profitability about our book and we wake up every morning wanting to retain most of the accounts. So, I think to characterize our strategy is taking down prices to grow, in our minds it's not consistent with how we think about it but.\nJay Benet:  And I want to take the opportunity to clarify something because I am quite certain Gabby will get ten calls before the end of the day on this and it gets back to the analytics but I was keeping you that before that evaluates returns on a investment return basis today. Let me be a little more specific. So we are talking about allocating capital. Each of our products, each of our business is based up on the duration and the volatility are actually defined and amount of capital too. The embedded return that we calculate for the portfolio assumes that the premium dollars come in at new investment rates but that the capital, because the capital sits and just continues to roll has a much longer duration so the capital that supports it is somewhat more reflective of the historical capital embedded in the portfolio. So, premiums come in entirely at new money rates. Again this is the analytics that we use, the capital based up on allocated capital to that product reflecting more of the historical duration kind of because again it supports the business as one piece of business rolls off and new piece of business comes on. The capital has a different duration than the new premium base and if you look at the business insurance segment in the aggregate as we did just yesterday and making sure that we can answer this question. The policy view, the return that we see in the business that we are writing today is very low double digit. That's where we fall; I don't want to get more specific than that because obviously it's reflecting of our pricing strategy. But it wouldn't take much to move into high single digits but its very low double digits.\nVinay Misquith - Credit Suisse: Okay, that's fair. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Hi good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the holding company liquidity and get an update. I can't get the math to reconcile. I'm looking at the end of the second quarter. I added net investment -- I'm sorry, net income, took out share repo and dividends and it looks like liquidity was almost a couple of hundred million higher. Could you help reconcile the math there? Was there a dividend in the quarter perhaps?\nJay Fishman: Let's say, at the beginning of the quarter, for holding company liquidity we had about $2.4 billion. The way the mechanics of this thing are taking dividends out of the operating companies and bringing them up to the holding company. I mean there are other things that impact it like stock option and equity awards. That's a relatively small number. Tax has come into play. There is going on the other way interest on the corporate debt, shareholder dividend, stock repurchases themselves, any pension plan funding we do. So those are the components of it. I'm not sure you can really have full visibility to all those components but what ends up happening is that the 2.4 grows to 2.8 and the two major drivers of that are the size of the dividends coming up from the operating companies versus the amount of share repurchases that go out.\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay, but there was no special dividend. Like if I recall in the first quarter did you take a special dividend up and there was nothing in the quarter?\nJay Fishman: No we had a dividend in the quarter. Let me clarify what's going on with the dividends. I think in our 10-K at the beginning of the year of course, we had indicated that we could take dividends up without special authorization of something around $3.5 billion is my recollection. Somebody is going to look that up for me. But we also said during the first or second quarter, I'm not sure which one was that based on the capital positions of the operating companies which had gotten very robust, we were actually going to go to our regulators and say that we wanted to take capital out of the operating companies at a higher level than that would have indicated and get their authority to do that which we did and we did that in the first quarter. And when you do that it also changes the dynamics going forward of what constitutes normal dividend versus what constitutes a special dividend. So in each of the quarters we have gone to our regulators and said we'd like to take X out and in each of the quarters we've been given permission to do that. But its all in conjunction with a strategy as Jay has talked about of always rightsizing the capital at the place and you've heard me say before that we manage to a certain level of capital and the operating companies to support the AA ratings and that's what all we're doing. So our regulators understand that, the rating agencies understand it and it's just what's flowing through right now.\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay, so just to be clear the, so when we take your end of period holding company liquidity and we -- all we get is kind of what net income and then we know what you're buying back and we know what you are giving to your shareholders. What you are saying is there is an amount that you guys are going to the regulators intra quarter and requesting to take up from the subsidiaries and so -- and that doesn't necessarily correlate one to one with net income\nJay Benet:  That's correct, I mean we take money out of the operating companies each quarter because we are making money in the operating companies each quarter and if you look and if you take a big picture view of what we have been saying for the year. Our guidance is for share repurchases of 4.5 to $5 billion. That if you look at what our year-to-date net income is and that certainly doesn't equate to a picture for the year of 4.5 to 5 billion. Those two numbers are long that are showing that we are taking capital out of this.\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay so I guess to push one more level on that then is so therefore the payout can sustainably be ahead of net income for the foreseeable future?\nJay Benet: You get to a point where you have taken out the excess capital so you eventually get to a steady state where the payout is going to be based up on what is your net income, what are your capital needs in the company and what are your various targets for holding company and liquidity and debt and everything else. So, eventually you do get to (inaudible).\nJay Fishman:  We have talked previously as you all know that we are going to stop the practice and giving guidance when we get to next year but one of the things I think that we probably do have to provide some continuing visibility on this projected share repurchases because to exactly your point you really can't independently make an assessment of what our capital position is and what's available. So my guess is as that when we get to the fourth quarter and we got our plans and budgets all squared away for next year. We really are not going to speak to EPS but we will give you a robust understanding of what our capital management plans are?\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Great that's helpful. Thanks. The other one on capital management is just a dividend policy, could you just remind us how probably set that because the dollars allocated to dividend obviously have been flat for a while, while the share counts gone down. So just how do you think about that going forward?\nJay Benet: I will look at it historically whatever you are comfortable on.\nJay Fishman: I mean if we take a look at what the dividend yields are for comparable companies and the property causality space. We look at payout ratios and we recognized that we are in a business where the wind blows and the earth shakes. We take that into account in the past and what we have been fortunate enough to be able to do over the last couple of years is look at well we have a very solid earnings stream and we have paid out roughly $700 million if you look at the dollar amount in each one of the years. You are absolutely right our share count has gone down as a result of the repurchases. So we have been increasing the dividend to bring the dollar payout roughly back up to the same level which has basically kept the payout ratio and the yields very competitive.\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay. Totally shifting gears from capital management, can you comment at all on the workers comp pricing environment, we are hearing stuff out of Florida and others. What are you seeing at the margin there?\nBrian MacLean:  Yeah sure this is Brian and if you look at our numbers you will see that we have been growing our workers comp and it's actually that we are growing it for about 10 years. We have been growing it fairly gradually. In the aggregate for our book we feel very good and while the economy is clearly impacted the exposures and pay roll changes and some places have been dramatic. We have been adding accounts and seeing some moderate growth in the line. The bottom line is Tom maybe more than any other products we do is a state-by-state industry-by-industry, account size-by- account size kind of dynamic. So we look at a very granular level and really believe it's the classic risk selection gain and feel good about it. One thing I would comment on and maybe I'll throw to Bill Cunningham is the AM best data on comps have a good bit of play and that's just a slice of the industry and you need to understand what it is that's looking at.\nBill Cunningham: That study of the price referencing was a composite of the state fund business and the mono line workers comp market business and as you look at that, many of those state funds are markets of less resort and obviously as we talk about selection and the things that we have in place. Selection is not possible when it's a market of last resort and the pricing is not always appropriate. So as we look at the profile of our book and our results are much different than that.\nBrian MacLean: Yeah and so Greg we would agree that there are certain states and certain industries where we'd be very concerned with comp and be pulling back but in the act that we feel good about our book.\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay, are rates at the margin, is pricing going up or down for that line?\nJeff Fishman: Again it's a state by state and for competitive reasons we aren't going to get into state specific. So we'd say on an overall basis our workers comp pricing has been fairly consistent with the approach we've been taking over the last few quarters. We have not seen a dramatic change.\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: No shift. Okay. Okay. Last one from me on direct cost.\nGabriella Nawi: What is it Greg?\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Just on direct auto, just because there is a lot of money that's being spent in that direction, just so I understand, you're pricing that business the same to both agents are you are to the direct customers. So there is no benefit for going direct to the travelers at this point, to the customer?\nJeff Fishman: Relative to the agent. They get the same price whether they go to the agent or they come direct. It's the only pricing track we have. We don't have one -- we have no experience in the direct channel. So we don't have an ability to create a pricing track yet based on experience.\nGreg Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay, I'll follow-up with that more offline. Thanks guys.\nGabriella Nawi: And we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of John Hall from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.\nJohn Hall - Wells Fargo Securities: Great, thanks very much. I have only two questions. I'll give them straight up. The first one has to do with whether you're utilizing any enhanced commission structure as you go after any new business, whether that's part of your program on a commercial line side and the second one has to do with the comment that Brian made. You talked about the economy or if and the when the economy providing it having a very positive effect on exposure and potentially premium trends. I was wondering if that notion is factoring into your retention strategy and how so.\nBrian MacLean: So first on the commission side, nothing unusual. We pay base commissions and we pay supplemental\u2026\nJeff Fishman: We don't have any -- we don't have any specials on with respect to growing or anything else. [Multiple Speakers]\nBrian MacLean: Our fundamental programs there over the last several years have remained very constant both in structure and in amount.\nJeff Fishman: We will obviously shoot predominantly our fixed value based commission to differentiate one producer, one agency versus another, those that grow more will have a higher fixed value based supplement than others but there's nothing special on with respect to growing this month or anything like that.\nJohn Hall - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay. So you're not utilizing any of the platform savings you talked about in that direction?\nJay Fishman:  In small commercial I don't think they have changed the commission structure as expressed. Did we put it out? We did for a little maybe years ago but not currently.\nJohn Hall - Wells Fargo Securities: Okay great.\nJay Fishman: And the second question?\nJohn Hall - Wells Fargo Securities: On the economy and.\nJay Fishman: It's been an interesting phenomenon that we speak about a lot and we talked about it for literally years that the renewed market has had a remarkable stability to it that actually is consisted with those of who us who are in the business in the 90s it's fairly. There is a robust competitive environment for new business but yet the renewed book seems to be and this is universal by the way. It's just not us if you look at any carrier, maybe quality carrier. You speak to agents, you speak to brokers they will all comment and the ones we speak to will observe that the renewal market has a remarkable stability, our customers are just happy. Most customers are happy just staying where they are and the fact is as long as the premium doesn't go up there they are happy with the broker, they are happy with the carrier and the experience is good and the business is just suppose is there.\nJohn Hall - Wells Fargo Securities: And on the exposure change if your comment is getting at is there anything, let me answer it directly. There is nothing explicitly in how we are evaluating business or pricing business that contemplates a growth and exposure and therefore a different profitability dynamic on the account going forward. Obviously we think about in these and we are hopeful in these conditions that if you got a account and you feel comfortable with them today as the economy expense is going to get bigger and that will be a better thing. But we are not building it into the economics of how we are viewing the trade.\nBrian MacLean:  And the notion in today's environment I am sure like most of your employers the ability \u2013 the willingness of your employers to take on added costs that aren't justified with underlying activity is a substance of issue for every business and it's a substance of issue for our customers. It's not particularly easy nor well received. If you go to a customer with \u2013 getting through a challenging economic environment and suggest that we raise the price for insurance. So our retention strategy is molded by the environment we are in that the economic environment we are in and the realization that there are real life customers on the other side of the transaction and you got to be responsive to the overall economic environment and manage the business for the long term and that really defines the approach.\nJohn Hall - Wells Fargo Securities: Great. That answers the question. Thank you.\nOperator:  Ms. Nawi I will now turn the call back to you.\nGabriella Nawi:  Well thank you all for listening and if you do have any follow-up questions please contact myself or Andrew Hersom in the Investor Relations Department. Thank you very much and have a good day.\nOperator:  Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everybody.

Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the investor section on our website, travelers.com. With that, here is Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Given the very substantial second quarter weather losses for the entire property casualty industry of course for us, we were pleased with our performance this quarter reporting net income of a $1.35 per diluted share, an increase of 6% from last year's quarter and a return on equity of 10.1%. Recognizing that our operating income of $1.39 per diluted share is about $0.11 below consensus estimates, I would like to make the following observations. First, the $0.11 differential equates to approximately $50 million after tax. I point out that for the first six months of the year we have an excess of $1.3 billion. Secondly, the shortfall was attributable to second quarter weather losses which aggregated $285 million after tax or $0.58 per diluted share. To put that cost in context, we estimate for catastrophes for the second quarter included in our previously provided guidance was $92 million after taxes or $0.19 per diluted share. As best as we can tell consensus estimates included $0.22 per diluted share for second quarter catastrophe losses. To put the first half weather losses in context, we have already recorded $597 million of after tax catastrophe losses or $1.19 per diluted share. The methods used to estimate our expected annual catastrophe losses indicate an expected annual loss of $390 million after tax or $0.80 per diluted share for the entire 2010 year. So we have been after just six months we are now well in excess of our expected annual loss estimate for the full year. Recognizing that we do not control the timing of weather, we just take these events in stride. There have been periods where catastrophe losses have been exceptionally low such as in 2006 and 7 and there were times when they ran abnormally high. We praise our product for the long term and weather will occur when it does. We do not believe this high level of catastrophe loss is in any way a result of changed underwriting standards or reinsurance practices and Brian is going to have more to say about our cap losses later. Third, the quarter also benefited from $251 million or $0.51 per diluted share of favorable reserve development. Again as best as we can tell consensus estimate s for the quarter included $0.23 per diluted share of favorable reserve development. And just a reminder because development is so unpredictable we do not include it in any of our guidance. In terms of the operating environment for the second quarter, we remain quite pleased with our performance in our personal insurance segment both auto and home owners. Given the amount of discussion at this time last year on our agency auto business, we are particularly pleased with the improving rate of change of policies enforced in personal insurance. Profitability in the first half improved versus last year and we are pleased that the actions taken to improve profitability which we spoke to you about this time last year are coming through in the results. In our commercial businesses the operating environment really remained very similar to last quarter. Retention rates remained quite strong and rate on renewal business remained positive but it was at a lower level than in the first quarter. The negative impact of the economy on net written premiums has moderated somewhat from recent quarters and we are hopeful that this bodes well for future economic growth. We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter and since the second quarter of 2006 we have now repurchased over $12 billion of our common stock. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders. Given that municipal bonds have been receiving a lot of attention lately, we felt we would take a few minutes this morning to have Bill Heyman take the truth strategy and the tactical positioning behind our muni portfolio and demonstrate why we are comfortable with what we own. Our investment team has applied to our municipal portfolio the same very thoughtful approach to risk and reward that served us exceptionally well during the capital market crises over the last several years. I am sure you will find it helpful. And with that let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Jay. There are a few points based on the data contained on pages 4 through 7 of the webcast that I would like to highlight this quarter. First is our strong balance sheet. All capital leverage and liquidity measures remained at or better than target levels. Second is the repurchase of $1.4 billion of our common shares this quarter and the payment of $173 million in common stock dividends. This brings a total cash we returned to our shareholders to $3.1 billion in the first half of this year. Holding company liquidity of $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter down as planned from the $3 billion we held at the beginning of the quarter due to our share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our holding company. Another quarter in which we increased both value per share, operating performance, ex-cats [ph] and favorable prior year reserve development but including that investment income that was in line with our expectations. Another quarter of net favorable reserve development in each of our segments mostly driven by business insurance where we are announcing better than expected loss results with property, worker's comp and commercial auto product lines and recent accident years and where we have reestimated unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves given recent loss results. And finally a double-digit ROE and operating ROE despite the record second quarter cap losses. I would also like to point out that we successfully renewed our cat treaties this quarter, keeping essentially the same structure but at a modestly lower cost. The new treaties are outlined on several pages on the webcast and are described more fully in our second quarter 10-Q which has been filed earlier today. So let us have Brian now discuss our operating performance.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Before I go into the business-specific results, a few comments on this quarter's catastrophe losses. As Jay mentioned, this was the highest level of second quarter catastrophe losses in our history so obviously a different weather quarter and it is on the heels of high first quarter catastrophe loss. In this quarter the activity was not of a national headline variety but it was a very active quarter with numerous significant events. Page 8 lists out the 14 industry-designated cats for the second quarter of 2010 with initial property claim services or PCS essence [ph]. Although 14 second quarter events are not unusually high for the industry, the severity of the number of these events is clearly out of pattern. The initial industry estimates of 3.6 is very preliminary and based on reported activity to date. This will obviously develop up and we are confident that once fully developed this will be one of the largest industry catastrophe second quarters. As we look at our level of losses, we are confident that they are not a result of changes in our mixed business, selection process, geographic footprint, or public grant and we do not see anything that would indicate a fundamental change in weather patterns. Slide 9 displays our first and second quarter catastrophe loss ratios for the last six years or since our first full year post merger. It shows that for 2010 both quarters were significantly above average level. Within the previous five years with the exception of the second quarter of 2008, catastrophe weather losses were relatively mild. Accordingly, we do not see 2010 as a trend but just another data point which we will factor into our assessment of risk and reward. So we are going to stay in the weather business and we will continue to actively manage our closure. Now let me shift to discussing the segment results and I will start with business insurance. When excluding catastrophe unpredictability, underwriting income was very strong driven by continued favorable prior year reserve development. In the current year, loss trend continued to be fairly benign and consistent with our expectations. The renewal rate change on premium for the first half of the year has been slightly positive but is below loss trend and less than expected. So the impact on margins is slightly more than we anticipated. Overall, net written premiums were down slightly in the quarter, but not down as much as earlier in the year. The negative impacts of the economy on our insureds, which we see in lower exposures and reduced audit premium continued but have moderated from earlier levels.So, now I will turn to pricing, and if unpredictability has been the message with the weather, stability is the message in our aggregate domestic commercial insurance pricing. Slide 11 grasps our renewal premium change and splits out the [inaudible] rate and exposure change components. The short story here is that nothing is really changing. Overall renewal premium change on guaranteed cost business was essentially flat, with a modest improvement in exposure change, offsetting the modest decline in rate change. These overall trends are fairly consistent on an individual business basis, but as always, there are differences, and I would like to highlight a few things. Starting with Slide 12, and select accounts. We have been getting some good premium increases and retentions have been consistent, but a few points below where we historically have been. New business has been mixed with strong results in smaller accounts, but in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, lower new business levels in Express Plus. In the second quarter, we moderated our pricing strategy and believe this helped boost our Express Plus new business in the quarter. On the renewal book, we typically work 90 days in advance. So, any impact on retention will start in the third quarter. Overall, we continue to feel very good about our Select Express platform and how we are positioned in this market. In commercial accounts, retentions have remained very strong and the renewal premium change has improved modestly, going from a slight negative to a slight positive. If you look at the commercial accounts chart at the bottom of page 13, you can see that there's essentially flat premium change as a result of improving exposure changes and slightly lower rate changes. When negotiating the renewal, we are negotiating both the pure rate and total premium with the accounts. As the impact of the economy on our customers' exposures has become less negative, it has become increasingly more difficult to negotiate a rate increase, especially when it would result in an overall premium increase. New business results for commercial accounts were down compared to the prior year quarter. In the second quarter of last year, our new business writings benefited from the marketplace disruption caused by the financial distress of several of our competitors. Absent this impact, the results reflect a normal seasonality of our business. Our new business flow has stabilized at record levels, with quote rates slightly and close rates down slightly. Given these dynamics, we continue to be very pleased with our new business performance. In other business insurance, retentions have remained very strong or price change for both the rate and exposure have moved more significantly than the overall commercial business. These pricing impacts are primarily driven by our large property business, with some significant softening in rates but improvement in exposure. As competitive pressures in this class of business increased in the coming quarter driven by ample reinsurance capacity and a benign 2009 hurricane season, we made a conscious decision to maximize our retention on this business and not push rates on large property accounts. Similarly large property new business became increasingly more competitive with aggressive concessions to expiring terms and conditions frequently required to motivate accounts to leave their current carrier and we are not willing to make these concessions. In summary, we continue to prudently manage each of our businesses and adjust our actions to the unique needs. But in the aggregate, the results are not different than our recent experience, that is, solid retentions, relatively stable pricing, and a strong flow of new business opportunities. In the financial, professional, and international insurance segment, the core underwriting margins were generally stable in the quarter as the marginal rate gains essentially offset slightly increasing loss trends. Additionally, the underwriting margins benefited from a reduction in surety reinsurance cost associated with prior year reinsurance [trading]. Net written premiums, after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates were down for the quarter. In some of our management liability lines of business and in some of our international lines, we believe pricing is not consistent with our profitability targets, so our writings in those lines are down. Turning to production statistics on page 16, although renewal premium change is slightly negative in both management liability and international, for most of the businesses contained here, we have achieved positive rate gains. Turning to personal insurance. In agency, auto, our underwriting margin, after adjusting for the impact of tax, and prior year developments, improved quarter-over-quarter, as rate gains once again outpaced loss cost trends. Within agency, property, we have been speaking to you for sometime regarding the slight margin compression, driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles. As the rate gains we achieved in recent quarters continue to earn through our property business, we have crossed an inflection point, where in the second quarter our rate improvement outpaced loss cost trends. Agency, auto new business improved in the second quarter as we reintroduced our 12-month policy. As we have become more confident in our new business products and are consistently within target returns, we felt it was appropriate to reintroduce a longer term policy. The aggregate timing impact of this additional six months of written premium was about $30 million in the quarter. As the rollout of this product is completed, the impact on our new business written premiums will increase throughout 2010. More significantly, we are pleased with the improving rate of change in policies in force. We believe the PIF change is a result of our improved competitive position compared to third and fourth quarter of 2009. Agency, property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market. Quarter-over-quarter PIF growth was at the highest level since third quarter of 2007. Retention improved two points, and new business is up 15% compared to the same quarter last year. Given the expansion in core underwriting margins and the strong topline trends in these products, we are very pleased with both our current and going forward marketplace position in personal insurance. So, let me sum it up. Weather has been bad. But it's a big part of our business, and the one thing we know for sure is that it will change. The commercial marketplace, both domestic and international is fairly stable. We obviously wish it was improving, but we feel great about our position and are confident we will maximize the opportunity. And in personal insurance, we are encouraged by the trends both for us and the industry. With that, let me now turn it over to Bill Heyman to discuss our tax-exempt portfolio.\nBill Heyman: Thanks Brian. Since municipal securities have received considerable attention in the press, I thought I would spend a few minutes discussing the sector in general and our portfolio in particular. As you know, we have a tax-exempt portfolio of about $41 billion. You may not know that of that about $7 billion consists of bonds which have been pre-refunded, which means they have been [inaudible] maturity or their first call date usually with US treasury securities. Still the $34 billion remaining constitutes about half of our fixed income portfolio. The first observation I make is that we have fortunately always starting long before credit cards became an issue, viewed taxes and credits as credits first, without regard to any advantages or taxes [inaudible]. While optimization of the alternative minimum tax provides a target allocation, it's not a bucket we feel we must fill regardless of quality. And a general obligation of the school district competes with the corporate bond or mortgage-backed security for investing dollars. We scrutinized closely not only the creditworthiness of the issuer but the nature of the obligation. For example, in some cases, revenue bonds could be stronger than [GOs] and vice versa. Furthermore, where issuers have enhanced their creditworthiness with bond insurance, we've always ignored it. The result was that several years ago, when the bond insurers more or less simultaneously lost their AAA ratings, we did not make portfolio changes. The result of high credit underwriting standards means that our portfolio does not closely resemble the broad market. For example, we own about 23 million of municipal healthcare revenue bonds, or about one-tenth of 1% of our portfolio. Such bonds represent roughly 7% of the broad market and since 1970, 39% of all municipal defaults have been in the healthcare sector. Conversely, we are overweighted in pre-refunded bonds, states and local general obligation bonds and water and sewer bonds. Recent focus on general obligation bonds relates to the potential for these bonds to be treated like senior unsecured debt with bondholders becoming general creditors alongside employees, retirees and vendors. The general credit [at construct] is most descriptive of general obligation bond issued by states and general funds act like pools collecting revenues from a wide range of taxes and paying salaries, making pension contributions, paying vendors, as well as servicing their general obligation debt. In contrast, this construct is probably not descriptive of many local general obligation bonds. We expect that in its premises where there is a many local GOs would be treated as secured creditors based upon legal presidents and the provisions of Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code which provides that the security interest in special revenues remains valid and enforceable in bankruptcies. As you know most school district general obligation bonds are specifically authorized by voters and validate issuance [ph]. This authorization allows the pledge of ad valorem taxes to be levied on all taxable property within the school districts without limitation as to greater amount. The collection of these taxes is generally segregated in the debt service fund outside of the general fund and these funds can only be used to service the authorized debt and are not available that can ask the general purposes of this school. The unlimited in nature and segregation of this debt service, tax revenue contrast sharply with the school districts other property tax revenues which are statutorily limited and commingled with its state peoples funding and used for operations. In addition to assembling the portfolio selectively, we manage it actively. The portfolio contains approximately 8000 discrete securities but have only 925 issuers. They're over 50,000 issuers in the municipal markets. We have general obligation bonds of (inaudible) 75 cities, there are over 5300 in the Bloomberg database. So we feel we know our cities well. We monitor closely financial position and operations of our credits, while it is true that we are basically buying to hold investors. We have in the past year reduced often substantially, positions and issuers with credit worthiness as in our view deteriorated. So I would add we believe it even those issues we sold are overwhelmingly likely to pay every dollar on time. As we demonstrated two years ago with our mortgage portfolio, we do not blindly rely on ratings, but it is nonetheless worth noting that roughly 50% of our municipal portfolio holdings which are not funding having an average AAA rating from Moody's S&P and Fitch, compared to only 17% of the broad market. Almost 96% are rated AA3 or higher, only 4%, 4.3% are rated A or lower compared to 33% in the index. Rating agencies are looking at the same challenging economic budget and spending dynamics affecting state and local governments that all of us are, yet the ratings of our holdings remain very strong. A recent publication my Moody's points out that over the entire period 1970 to 2009, the riskiest 20% of municipal issuers measured by ratings accounted for 86% of all defaulters. Our portfolio contains approximately $7.2 billion in state general obligations with only about $330 million in the headwind [ph] states of California, Illinois and New York. The table in the webcast contains the aggregate holdings and the average ratings of our top 16 states. With the exception of our holdings from California which averages AA2, the average rating for each state is AA1 or higher. The general obligation bonds of the top five states totaled $1.4 billion. All that said we have purchased very few big state GOs in recent years and have sold a few recently. The other slide in the webcast presents the runoff of our state GOs based on current market yields for those borrowers and the coupons structure of our holdings nearly 70% of our state GOs will mature or will be called by 2015. For local general obligation bonds from the top five states totaled $6.4 billion and the revenue bonds from these states totaled $3.6 billion. Our general obligation bonds and issuers other than states consists towards school district exposures with the moderate number of counties, cities, community college districts and other special districts. As we just discussed the nature of these obligations is such that most could be considered as obligations sent through by a pledge or revenue from ad valorem property taxes levied without limitation to greater amount. As we have discussed previously a fixed income portfolio exist first and foremost to ensure our commitment to our policy holders. We underwrite the invested risks assumed in our portfolios with careful consideration of the tradeoff between risk and returns. Just as in the other fixed income assets, we do not reach for yield in our municipal portfolio in attempt to outperform our benchmark, lose investment manager's compensation or for any other reason. We expect our fixed income assets, including our municipal portfolio, to provide adequate risk adjusted returns and support our insurance operations in pursuit of maximizing wealth for shareholders over the long term. Obviously, history may not be indicative of the future and ratings cannot be relied upon with certainty, but we believe our portfolio is strong and we wouldn't trade it for anyone else's. We can certainly have losses in our municipal portfolio, and even material losses, but even due to the prism of recent events, we feel very comfortable with what we own. Let me turn it over now to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Bill. Well, let's discuss updated guidance for the full year. We've got information on Page 22 of full year 2010 fully diluted operating income per share, which has now been refined from the previous range of $5.20 to $5.55 to a new range of $5.20 to $5.45, which is a $.10 reduction of the upper-end of the range that primarily resulted from commercial-renewal premium increases in 2010, not meeting our original expectations which we believe is attributable to the impact of the continuing difficult economic environment. In round numbers, this range for operating income should still translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 11% as we've said before. We continue to anticipate some accident near-loss ratio deterioration on a consolidated basis for full year 2010, ex cuts, as we expect loss-cost increases to modestly outpace projected earned-rate increases in our commercial businesses for the full year. So in your modeling, please remember that the second half of last year included favorable re-estimations of current year-loss ratios for first half 2009 losses, so quarterly loss ratio comparisons for 2010 versus 2009, must take this into consideration. We're now assuming cut losses of $835 million after tax or $1.71 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cut losses to the first half and our original estimates for the second half of the year, no further estimates of prior year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable, below single-digit decrease in average investment assets ex unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to the share repurchases of full-year share repurchases of $4 billion, and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases in employee equity awards of approximately 487 million shares. So with that, why don't we open it up for Q&A?\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital: Thanks. My first question is on the pace of the share buybacks. Choblers repurchase a $3 billion of stock in the first half of this year, I believe the guidance is for $4 billion for the first year, you have the still almost $4 billion left in the existing authorization. I was just trying to get a sense of why the pace may slow or might that just be a conservative outlook. And my second question has to do with the economy. It appears that we're lacking some of the more challenging comparisons, so I'm trying to get a sense of how much of a benefit the stabilizing economy could be and whether Travelers feels the consumer raised prices as exposures increase? Thanks.\nJay Benet: Jay, thank you. First on the share buyback, we have historically scaled back in the third quarter, a pending, obviously, catcheese and of course it seems to us like we've already endured two quarters of that season already. My recollection was that the original estimates of share buyback included in the guidance was $3 billion, $4 billion and \u2013 $3.5 billion to $4 billion. And essentially we are still largely on that target for the moment. We may alter that as we go into the quarter, depending upon second half of the year that is, depending upon earnings, depending upon whether our reserve development can extend to the course and all that. But nonetheless, it's a plan that we embraced beginning of the year and for the moment we're sticking to it. Your second question and maybe Brian and I will ham and egg this a little bit. We certainly can't approve this to you, it's largely anecdotal. It's from sitting with conversations with our field folks and I'm speaking now about your question regarding the commercial insurance environment. Our census is that there isn't anything that has particularly changed competitively. You all seem to be fixated all the time, have some company or companies change their pricing strategy or tactics, we certainly don't see that and have no evidence of it. What we are hearing from our field folks is that as exposure is leveling out and it was \u2013 a comment I made earlier was that it looks as though exposure is trying to get back to zero broadly speaking in the commercial lines businesses is that it's getting more challenging to get rate increases. If you're a customer you really don't focus on the granular dynamics that make up your price, your premium. You're really not all that worried about how much is exposure and how much is rate change and all that nonsense, what you as a customer tend to look at is, is my premium going up or down in its simplest form and as exposure flattens out to the extent that you try and get rate gains you're asking for a premium increase in this economic environment or census is that it's getting just more challenging to pass that rate increase on. There is more or little more resistance both from the intermediaries, the agents and brokers as well as the customers to accepting meaningful rate increases. Now it's interesting, we didn't present the data but we certainly do look at the distribution of rate gains in our middle market business each and every quarter. We've shared that with you previously and to the extent they are lost dynamics at work to the extent that an account has loss experience, that's different more problematic than what it had originally been expected. We do get rate gains. There are still significant accounts where we'll see a plus five or even a plus 10 rate gain but it largely is loss driven. It's not in effect margin or profitability driven. So, I'd love to hear if Brian has any comment but our census is that the margin picture broadly in our commercial businesses is modestly deteriorating, that it's and that is that our ability to get rate in the aggregate is a little bit less than what you're experiencing broadly speaking in loss trends. So that's the way that we would I think I'd answer.\nBrian MacLean: I mean one of the phrases that I'd emphasize that Jay just used is this economic environment. So we certainly wouldn't want to make the statement that as long as exposures are coming up we can never get rate changes. If you think of where the psyche of our typical commercial customer is today they saw the economy take a big dip, they saw their business by and large take a big dip. The good news is, if we look at our total portfolio they're kind of back to not dipping anymore. They're not yet back to growing or anything close to robustly growing and in that mindset they saying they're going \u2013 again, loss experience being neutral we're going to struggle with premium increases. So that's the dynamic we're seeing today.\nJay Benet: In the context of returns in our business you always got to go back to where are we from a profit margin perspective. When we went back, you go back to the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, which obviously contemplated normal tax and no reserve development, the return on equity that we were projecting for the year was about 11% and in the context of the environment we're in, both the investment environment and important to remember the investment environment combined with the economic environment, that's a pretty good return. It's difficult for us to plead that profitability measures in our business are inadequate and as a consequence we need to improve margins in this investment and economic environment to the extent that we're capable of producing an 11% return on equity we feel pretty good. So, we continue to try and keep rate where most importantly where the loss experience demonstrates that we should and to the extent that we can improve our profitability dynamic as we move forward we'll continue to do that but it's not as if we're starting from a point of impaired profitability in any way, it's a pretty strong franchise and a pretty strong profit picture in the context of that environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Heimermann from JP Morgan.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Hi good morning everybody. A couple of questions for Bill. One, I was just curious if you could comment on the performance of the other investment income line this quarter and what drove that, just a little surprising given what macro is happening in the investment environment. Then second, just with respect to the municipal portfolio I guess if someone wanted to play devil's advocate, a lot of the defenses of the municipal securities market around rating, average credit quality, things like that or things that were made for the mortgage market. So I guess if you had to be realistically bearish on your portfolio or the market probably what would you point to as kind of the bigger risk?\nBill Heyman: Okay let's take them in order. In terms of the other assets, the results of the quarter where it could be the more [ph] to strong distributions in private equity, cash flow from the portfolio for the first six months was about even that means distribution equal capital contributions, which is better than we would have expected and there was a lot of net investment income gain in the results that we saw. Hedge funds made money but not very much, made a couple of points better than the broad index. Our hedge fund portfolio was only about 470 million, it was 1.6 billion at the time of our merger. And frankly we find it difficult to put an ex-ante facto, which managers will do well and which won't. So we have handful of relationships of longstanding. In real estate, a lot of our funds had marked down properties probably excessively and the first half of the year reflected a balance in evaluations excluding municipals. I agree with you, one can argue both sides of the equation forcefully. We think about this issue everyday but I would add we're not talking our book because we can't get out of where we are. If we decided that instead of 34 billion, forget the (inaudible) for the moment instead of 34 billion it ought to be 20 billion or 25 billion. The quality of our holdings would permit us to make that adjustment and the market is very firm, frankly it's firm, it's very firm even in credits we wouldn't buy. In terms of the risks in the sector and I think I alluded to this at investor day in May. I think the risks are less of economic default but even with states with big budget problems are when you analyze them is not very heavily taxed. The risks are that some jurisdictions will seek, if a court allows them, it may not to, repudiate their debt simply because they choose not to increase taxes or cut budgets. I think with respect to larger jurisdictions the possibility of it is pretty remote. It is one thing to only have access to the capital market at a higher price and frankly most jurisdictions haven't even faced that penalty yet. It is another to lose access to the capital market altogether, which is what would happen in a political repudiation. So I agree, the issue is not free from doubt and our take on it can be disputed but it's not (inaudible).\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Walsh from Citi Group.\nKeith Walsh \u2013 Citi: Good morning everybody. A couple of questions here, just to follow up on the exposures, trend looks better. How do we reconcile that with sort of the negative data that we've been seeing coming out of small businesses whether it's lending, business optimism, new business startups. And then if you could also touch on the trends you're seeing within auto premiums and then I've got a follow-up for Bill, thanks.\nJay Fishman: I'll take the first and I'll ask Greg to take on the second. First I think our exposure data is actually largely in sync with what we see as to GDP changes broadly. We're not seeing growth, what we're actually seeing is a leveling out and I think that there are some measures that would suggest that the economy is actually expanding modestly. There are some that would suggest that \u2013 there are some that would suggest that that it has flattened. And that's largely at this point what our aggregate data say. There will be some pluses and some minus in various businesses. But the exposure change that we saw in the second quarter across all of our commercial businesses in the aggregate was getting close to zero. And I think if you asked anyone from an economic perspective what do they see, they would largely say that at the very least we flattened out. So we don't see it as in consistent, maybe there is something else that you see, but that's kind of our take on.\nBrian MacLean: Keith, on the second piece, did you ask about auto or audit?\nKeith Walsh \u2013 Citi: Audit premiums.\nBrian MacLean: Okay, and this is Brian. On the audit premium side, we've talked about the numbers before at the depth of \u2013 in the normal environment, we're going to see something like three to five points of positive on the audit premium side. Around the end of last year, very beginning of this year, we were running about a point negative and we are close to back to zero. So we're at a \u2013 at a really modest negative number. So pretty consistent with that that same view on the exposure change numbers. So still negative, but close to back to a plus number. Now, again in normal world, we'd look for a plus three to five so.\nJay Fishman: And that's less about \u2013 (inaudible) speak to that point about being it less about the economies and the way our policies work.\nBrian MacLean: Well, yes, there's obviously that audit premium has a lot to do with the psychology of the buyer and how the product is even sold. And the natural course is that the buyer is going to understate exposure slightly and we pick it up on the backend on the exposure and so we're always playing that game. So that leads to the normal three to five.\nJay Fishman: And so that one makes snapback \u2013\nBrian MacLean: Quite.\nJay Fishman: Somewhat unpredictable because we're doing with a psychology of our buyers and their willingness in effect you have a carry for a period of time, premium relative to expose your change, we of course factor that into our pricing, it's not a surprise to us. But that one may snapback faster because it is predominantly psychologically driven more than the overall genuine exposure which really is an economic dynamic.\nKeith Walsh \u2013 Citi: That's very helpful. And then, Bill, you started to touch on the some munis, but what I really want to know is who holds the senior position here, is it the bond holders or is muni workers, pension payments and healthcare benefits, where is that dollar going to go to if that has to, if we come down to that?\nBill Heyman: Well, we think in issuers below the state level bond holders. At the state level, less clear.\nKeith Walsh \u2013 Citi: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: Thank you. Just had a question about the FPII segment and to reserve development there, can you talk about that development relative to your management liability business in particular, the depository institutions? And I have one follow-up, thanks.\nJay Fishman: Sure. And, I guess, I'd direct you back to the conversations we've had previously about the credit crunch analysis and I'd say that probably the way that we're at it is it's stable. So hasn't been a lot of change. The release probably comes from six or eight years from '01 to '08 and the actuaries go through the data every quarter and they are making lots of estimates and judgments based on a lot of \u2013 a lot of cases that are still really at a state of infancy. So I would think, broadly speaking, no change.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: Okay. And then, I know, that disclosure last year, you had mentioned 26 institutions that had been closed, do you \u2013 can you update a little on the exposure there and any changes or any new institutions?\nJay Fishman: You mean clinically on the institutions that have been taken over?\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: Yes.\nJay Fishman: Yes. So far this year, I think we've got probably close to a 100 institutions that are being taken over about 96. We've got 33 of both.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: You \u2013 first you said we got.\nJay Fishman: There's been 96 institutions the FDIC has taken over. We're on about 33 of those, our average expose limits to those are about $4.5 million. So broadly speaking, it's developed since last year as we would have expected it to.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: Great, thank you. And then, just if I could one follow-up on personal lines, the \u2013 Brian you had mentioned on that slide at $3.6 billion I think in CAT expectations for the second quarter and Travelers' number in the second quarter is about $440 million. Am I looking at that in the midst about 10%? I just want to understand is it just different estimate base or how should we think about that? Thanks.\nBrian MacLean: The $3.6 billion on the industry slide is \u2013 comes out of PCS, property claimed services, and that is purely the kind of initial data that they've gotten from carriers. And in some cases, for some events that happened literally three or four weeks ago, so very, very immature data. That will develop up fairly dramatically.\nJay Fishman: History would suggest.\nBrian MacLean: History would suggest, yes. And just the way the claim process works.\nJay Fishman: I'd make a very important point. We don't utilize PCSF in the mix to make our estimates of losses from those events. Our losses are based upon what you're accruing are based upon claim notices, claims filed, and our people on the ground. So it's \u2013 the important point here is that while we believe that history again suggest the PCF data will develop negatively, historically, our estimates have actually been pretty good relative to catastrophe points.\nBrian MacLean: Because, obviously, what we're trying to do is, is as quickly as possible, take our claims data and make any actuarial estimate of what the ultimate will be. And PCF does that overtime, but it takes them longer. So it's really tough to do any kind of industry relativity right now. And then, obviously, you've got geographic distribution underneath that that you got to look at. But, so we will scrutinize that as the data becomes available. But, you know, all we know is it's a big industry event and it was a big quarter for us.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer: Okay, thank you for answering all my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Yes, thank you. A couple of questions. I guess, first maybe, big picture on the reserve development. I guess if you've looked at your accuracy, you almost think you guys aren't that good of setting reserves, given how redundant things have been. If you can talk more specifically about what's happening. I know it's going to vary by line and by segment, but is it more of a frequency issue or a severity issue, that's the first question. And then, secondly, maybe for Bill on the other investments. It looks like the return this quarter annualizes around 12%. And I've probably asked this before, but what would you consider the normalized return on those investments?\nJay Fishman: Jay, Brian's going to answer your question on the reserve development. But, I'll just make an observation that we really try hard to get it right, because the issue is actually how we priced our product to the extent that we end up overstating our loss costs going into a product offering than we're pricing it higher that we otherwise would have to and we become less competitive relative to someone who takes a different view. So it always feels good when it happens. Of course, it feels terrific when your results are impacted this way and certainly it's a whole lot better than underestimating the loss cost, which means, you're under pricing your product and that's really a disaster. But we really try hard to get it right, because in the end, what we're about is trying to grow a business and getting it right is what's going to help us do that the best. Now your points are relevant, we've had a long stretch year of significant development and Brian or Jay or \u2013\nBrian MacLean: I can (inaudible). When you look at the components that makeup the reserve development, frequency continues to be behaving in a way that when you go through the reserve setting process, you come up with as soon as what frequency is going to be and it's behaving better than that. And that's been a trend that's been going on for a while. When actuaries and finance people are looking at what the reserve process should be as it relates to favorable frequency and work with their business partners in terms of pricing and everything. If you look at what the current trends are, you wonder are things are going to get better than they are when you're at a favorable position. And sometimes you just look at it and say, \u201cWell, they're pretty good. And I can't imagine them getting better and sometimes they do.\u201d So that's been a part of it. We're in a very low inflationary environment today. And looking out several years as to what severity is going to be, it's just a little bit of a change in the inflationary outlook is going to have an impact as well. So you have to go back to what's the some base upon which all of this is being done and on a gross basis, our reserves are in excess of $50 billion. So that's absolute level of these changes in terms of percentage point are very, very low. But given the nature of that reserve base, they impact the income statement as you've seen but as Jay said, each one of these quarters, we're doing best estimates of what we see out there using all the information and there's the changes. We just update the reserves.\nBrian MacLean: And Jay, this is Brian, so two other points. Because if you look at where the development has come from not just in this quarter but over a good period of time, I'd say two things. First on the liability side where we had a lot of favorable reserve development, one of the toughest things to estimate that over time is where that sort of environment fell in and what the sustainable impact of that is. And so, that's been a big variable driving our improvement and at the same time, over and again, this is a five to six-year kind of statement. We've done a lot in our liability claim process that we think has helped the way we do business and service our customers and we think that's had a pretty strong impact there. But it takes time to see the impact of those things coming through the lost data and so that's been driving it. And then the other area is workers' comp which has continued, again, I always say this with comp \u2013 very much a state-by-state gain. But in the aggregate where we play, we continued to see some favorable moves there and frequency dynamics that Jay Benet talked about but comp would be an area where that's really been true \u2013 just trying to look at those frequency trends and project forward what do we think they're going to be in the future.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That's great and the other investment return?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, I think that one has to speak the various sectors rather than generalize for other investments. I think from owned real estate unleveraged, one article it makes, need the high single-digits leveraged real estate that has funds, low double-digit hedge funds, low double-digit private equity \u2013 maybe a little more. And therefore, our blended return depends on our allocation of those asset classes. Obviously one has to rethink all those returns. If we are in a protracted period at very low interest rates, we may all \u2013 all of us is going to be stuck in the mindset in what these assets are going to make in the world before 2008. But those are of course fact numbers.;\nJay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So based on what you just said, the returns in this quarter weren't terribly overstated at all?\nBrian MacLean: They are generalizing as a blend of number there. What we would hope to make over a statistically significant time period which unfortunately is more than a quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant from KBW. Please proceed.\nCliff Gallant \u2013 KBW: Good morning. Billing, actually off of on that is Jay's question a little bit in terms of loss cost trends, I'm just wondering about to what degree are you seeing favorable loss cost trends whether it be from deflation or even falling frequency? And to the extent that you are, how confident would you be to really act upon that in terms of your forward pricing? You know, I think of the personal auto industry 10 years ago where, in other words, we were about to experience several years of abrupt defalling frequency and I think some of the more aggressive companies like Progressive had wished that they had been able to fully anticipate that to really grow their book. And I'm curious how you would take that in terms of going forward?\nJay Benet: Well, first, I'd observe that this is very much line-by-line specific. There are long-tail lines where you take a deep breath obviously before you embrace an emerging trend. And I'm going to make an example, in workers' comp, we are still contemplating meaningful medical inflation. We're not pricing our product. We talk all the time that benign lost cost and inflation, you should always be excluding medical work in medical portion of workers comp. But we assume a robust inflation rate and we'll obviously see how that works out. Generally speaking, I think a couple of individual exceptions Brian talked about, asphalt shingles which a number of carriers have highlighted because it's a by-product price of oil. That loss cost trends severity have, broadly speaking, been awfully benign. That doesn't mean zero. It doesn't mean that we don't see some embedded inflation in lines of business. And we, as the shorter the tail of that business is, the more we're willing to embrace it and incorporate it into our pricing because if we're long, it doesn't take long before we can reprice the product. The same thing holds true for frequency. In many lines of business, there has been a long-term systemic decline in frequency and I would actually say that it's gotten \u2013 well we've been chasing it. You ask the question all the time as frequency comes down, is it making a new level or is it going to return back to previous levels, not only in from a pricing perspective but also from the reserving perspective as well. I think the same thing holds true to the extent that these are shorter-tail lines of business. We're pretty aggressive in embracing and to the extent that they are longer-tail, we're a little more reluctant to move in that direction. I think one of the things that's affected workers' compensation, I can't prove. It's just the data that we look at is that as our economy has moved increasingly to a service-based environment, frequency and workers' comp has come down. They've done another great surprise to people. And so that sort of a dynamic, that element, if you feel more comfortable embracing so it's very line specific. And I think it's difficult to generalize if there's a line that you're particularly interested in, you can attempt to answer.\nBrian MacLean: I mean, Cliff, you're really getting to the core of the puzzle we're trying to solve each and everyday in the marketplace. Do we understand why lost trends are changing? First of all, can we see it granular as possible where they're changing and breaking out. And then, the real trick is understanding lie. The generality would be the better we feel about our ability to understand why something is changing, the more confident we're going to be factoring into our pricing. Where you get in trouble as you see a pattern and you don't understand why, you need to start extending the patterns. Well, we could talk \u2013 it is as Jay said, it's very much a line-by-line\u2026\nJay Benet: And I do think though culturally, as a matter of the institutions and the way actually I was thinking and in this organization, you would characterize us as not pushing the edge. If there's, and again, particularly in longer-tail lines, you take a great risk when you make an assumption unless the changing trends embrace it, price your product, reserve for it, and find longer holiday yields, not only underpriced but under reserved boat. So I just think culturally here, we're not an organization that instinctively pushes the edge.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: A couple of quick questions here. First, looking at the business insurance action, your combined ratios, extra cash underlying, shifting from loss ratio aside, it looks like when you adjust for the current period development last year, it's up about 200 basis points year-over-year. Is that pretty consistent with who we should expect your going forward, given you comments about continued acts and the perpetration over the year?\nBrian MacLean: Brian, I'm trying to do the math in my head.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: I think what you said was about 62 last year in the second quarter. That's the current period.\nBrian MacLean: Yes, I would say pretty close to that.\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. I mean, the thing that we'd urge you to do or to everyone to do is look at last year's combined ratio, look at last year's loss ratio, a component in its totality for the year because of the re-estimation that took place in the third and fourth quarter. So the best proxy for what the loss ratio was for coming into 2010 would be the full year 2009 loss ratio. And then we said, we would expect some margin compression from that and so far, what you've seen is the first six months. That would be the mechanical comparison that you would want to do, recognizing that in any period, non-capital-related weather is also going about to round and there's going to be some noise from other large loss activity or whatever. But that would be the base information to be taken a look at.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: And then also, the business insurance, your G&A expenses, even if you add back the benefit you had the second quarter last year down, feel its extensively year-over-year, anything unusual going on there or is there some expense initiatives going on?\nJay Benet: Well, we're always closely managing expenses and there is the timing of some expenses that will take place with various quarters, one year versus the next. So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular going on there, other than we're always watchful of our expenses.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: Right. And then the last question, you talked about pricing and how you want to adjust it for \u2013 obviously what's going on with lost causes, et cetera, but what about interest rates right now? I mean, it seems like interest rates are going to be low here for a while longer. How can you adjust pricing for interest rates or can you in the current marketplace?\nJay Benet: Bill and I spend a lot of time talking about the environment, and it's very possible now that what we're in an extended period of time at where we are. And as a consequence, we are beginning to think meaningfully about what the implication of that is for our business. And that not only gets to pricing of our product but return expectations, capital embedded in our business, ways in which the capital is used. It's a broad question that gets well beyond, are you pricing adequately? Again, in this environment, these interest rates were able to generate round numbers and 11% return on equity. Now you begin to ask yourself the question, if riskless rates are where they are and spreads are where they are, then what are reasonable returns and what can be expected and how to we deploy our capital (inaudible) in a different environment. Whereas the \u2013 I would say the early stages of those discussions, that they are serious discussions that would you take your place irregularly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill: Good morning, and thank you for taking the call. First question, I think accurately heard that you are issuing annual policies for your personal (inaudible). And if that's the case, I'm a little bit curious in this strategy. Historically, I think if that is a sort of a top-of-the-market kind of strategy to hold on to your business as opposed to a bottom-of-the-market strategy. Given on the upside, you would typically want to be able to re-price your product as far as you can. Am I just wrong on that or is there a different subtlety here to that strategy that I'm missing?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey Paul, this is Greg Toczydlowski. I guess the answer to that question, you got to kind of start of it off where we began and we started driving a sophisticated product out in the marketplace about five years ago. And underneath that was our first (inaudible) in the predictable modeling. So as we needed to stay nimble and adjust that product, we kept the shorter-term contracts as we moved forward and become very confident in that new business pricing. And that, in combination with the demand base from our agents and customers based on the profile that we're trying to attract, we think it was prudent to issue the annual policy at this point in time. And again, as Jay talked about, some of the underlying dynamics of the personal insurance business, we feel terrific about acquisition right now.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill: My second question is back to the current returns. And I agree that 11% ROE, and especially relative to your peers, is a good result. The question I have is , is that does this in your mind suggest that essentially the market \u2013 the market largely ignores the interest rates where they are today and their profitability? And or is this in your view, a view that is essentially the hurdle rate has fallen for the industry because I would imagine that the hurdle if anything has gone up given volatility, uncertainty, the CAT losses. And the stock market seems to be behaving \u2013 the stock market looks like its behaving, the hurdle rate for the industry has risen over the cycle?\nJay Fishman: I understand the question, I think, anyway. I, at first, I certainly don't think that the insurance industry ignores investment returns as we price our products, we are driven by available investment returns in the marketplace. When \u2013 shortly after the crisis, when the world sort of settled back down and we were confronted with a different kind of fixed income environment than had existed , the real question was will you go into knee jerk react to a changing interest rate environment, causing disruption to agents, brokers, customers and all of your distribution. Who are you going to take a deep breath and see what would happen to investment returns over time. I've spoken about this earlier, it was our decision to take this in the longer view and not to knee jerk. Now 18 months ago and attempt to drive pricing up in some very dramatic fashion, I think that would have been not only highly disruptive, but candidly not very successful. That would be a strategy that I think would have failed. Now I think, and again, this is how we perceive it, you can certainly ask other companies what their view is. It may very well be that this economic malaise, such as it is, is longer rather than shorter and it may very well that this investment environment is a consequence, longer rather than shorter. And we are in, as I said the early stages of really thinking through the implications of that. It's a long view \u2013 we speak about returns over time. We try hard not to get tangled up and candidly this quarter, next quarter. But we managed this business to generate returns over time, and one of the questions that we long to ask ourselves is, in the investment environment that's available and given other investments? We recognize that we compete against other investments, including investments that are fixed income. We have land numbers of 3% yield at the moment, what are the implications of that? How do we think about our company? And what do we strive to produce for investors in a very different investment environment that existed even a couple of years ago. And it's a very legitimate question and we're ankle-deep in it at the moment as we try and weigh our weight through it. It's complex. Obviously, no one company can adopt the strategy that's disruptive in the marketplace and thinks somehow that it will be successful. We operate in a very competitive environment. So you have to balance all of those factors. More to follow, I just know immediate, clear answers about that issue, but a very relevant question.\nOperator: Miss Nawi, I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you very much for joining us this morning. If anybody has any additional questions, you can reach either myself or Andrew Hersom, Investor Relations Department.

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you\u2019ll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Friday, April 23, 2010. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Travelers discussion of our first quarter 2010 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the investor section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts maybe forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserves and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release, and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that maybe non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the investor section on our website. With that out of the way, here is a Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. All in, given the magnitude of catastrophes we experienced this quarter, we were quite pleased with our performance, reporting net income of $1.25 per diluted share, an increase of 13% from last year\u2019s quarter and a return on equity of nearly 10%. Included in this number was $0.61 a share in catastrophes, arising out of the multiple storms in the Eastern United States as well as the earthquake in Chile. Just to put this number in context, the estimate for catastrophes for the first quarter included in our previously provided guidance was about $0.13 a share. Offsetting the cats we benefited from favorable prior year development, and our underlying performance from both underwriting and net investment income was a bit better than our expectations. The net result was operating income, which was in line with our expectations going into the quarter, allowing us to reaffirm our previously issued fully year 2010 operating earnings per share guidance. Also it\u2019s reflective of our continuing strong earnings power. In an environment which remains similar to last quarter in terms of both economic and insurance market conditions, our business dynamics from a solid and we are generally consistent with recent operating experience. Renewal rate gains remained positive in each of our business segments, retention was strong and the business in total remained on par with last year\u2019s quarter. We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter, and announced the increase in our regularly quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.36 per share. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders. Given that our operating dynamics this quarter were generally consistent with recent quarters, our call this morning is going to be somewhat different than in the past. We are still providing all of the same information in our presentation as we have previously, but we will not be going page by page with you, so as to have more time for questions. Before turning over to Jay, I want to take just a minute to acknowledge and thank our claim department for all of their exceptional work, not only this quarter but over the last couple of years. In 2008, we had Ike Gustav in Dally, and while there were no major storms in 2009 it was still a quite active cat year. Of course, in the first quarter of 2010 we were again faced with an exceptional number of claims due to the multiple storms on the East Coast. [Inaudible] and her entire claim team have been remarkably busy providing industry meeting customer service to our insureds, and again demonstrating our commitment to providing high quality service to all of our insureds during their greatest time of need. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jay. There are several points that I\u2019d like to highlight relating to pages zero to seven, many of which you\u2019ve heard me say repeatedly over many quarters. First, our balance sheet remained extremely strong. All capital leverage and liquidity measures were half or better than target level. Even after repurchasing $1.4 billion of our stock and paying dividends of $168 million in the quarter, holding company liquidity increased to over $3 billion, almost three times on a target level due to the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our parent company. Holding company liquidity is expected to move towards its target level during the remainder of the year as we continue our share repurchases. Book value for share increased once again, and on an as reported basis operating income for the quarter did meet our expectations; that is operating performance ex the caps and ex the non-cap weather, and also adjusting for the favorable reserve development, but including net investment income, all of that was inline with our expectations going into the quarter. Despite the high cap losses and the relatively low yield on short term and non fixed income investments, we recorded a double digit operating ROE, and finally our results included one time tax charge of just under $12 million or approximately $0.02 per share, related to the recently and acted federal health care legislation that eliminated the tax benefit associated with Medicare Part D subsidies. Brian is now going to provide some color about our operating performance.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks Jay. We have included on pages eight through 16, all of the segment performance statistics that we traditionally discussed with you. As Jay mentioned we are not going to go through each slide, but instead speaks more broadly about the significant drivers for the quarter leaving more time for question. Obviously weather had a big impact on our results and will be the headline for the quarter. We had six domestic cat events, the two largest being the February snow storm in the Mid Atlantic that paralyzed Washington DC for several days; and then Easter in mid March that impacted New York, New Jersey and Southern New England. In addition there were several international events, the largest being the earthquake in Chile, so all-and-all a very active catastrophe quarter. But looking beyond the near term impact of weather, our production in core underwriting results continue to perform very well. In business insurance, the tensions remain strong and were up slightly across the business, renewal pricing improved modestly, with pure rate continuing to be positive for the segment, exposure change on renewed accounts were still down, but the rate of decline moderated slightly from last quarter. On the new business side, we feel good about the continued flow of new opportunities, particularly in middle market and the small end of select. New business writings in the quarter were down from prior year, primarily due to the pricing discipline we are maintaining in the larger end of the select business. This segment of the market has been particularly competitive and reduced writings here reflect that position. On a written basis premiums are down, a direct result of the impact of the challenging economy on our customers. Some of that impact is seen in renewal premium statistics, but the majority comes from reduced audit premiums, and increased cancellations and endorsements. These impacts either emerge over the life of the policy or in the case of audits, aren\u2019t reflected until the end of the policy period. Since we are generally auditing the accounts we wrote a full year ago, we expect this drag may continue to the next few quarters. As the economy stabilizes and eventually improves, we believe that based on our historical experience the audit premium will rebound. There are a lot of weather and prior year impacts in the combined ratio. Excluding these we are experiencing the modest deterioration we had expected. Frequency remains while claims severity is relatively benign, and pure loss trend is marginally outpacing our modest rate gains. This deterioration is somewhat larger than the 30 basis point change in the adjusted combined ratio on the slide, because the first quarter of 2009 does not include the positive impact of the adjustment we made to the full year \u201909 combined ratio in the second half of last year. Moving to the financial professional and international segment, net written premiums after adjusting for the impact of changes and foreign exchange rates, were up significantly for the quarter. The primary driver of this increase was less seated premium year-over-year, resulting mainly from changes in the structure of our reinsurance, that directionally aligned retentions in our international business, with the company\u2019s US retention practices, and to a lesser extent lower reinsurance costs. For the second consecutive quarter, we did see quarter over quarter growth in our construction surety book of business due to activity in our large national accounts market. In our international business, new business is up compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in marine and accident and special risk products and the like. Operating earnings in the quarter were down from the prior year quarter, as a result of our exposure to multiple international named events, primarily the Chilean earthquake. The losses we experienced were consistent with the fact the Chilean earthquake was the seventh largest recorded, and was 500 times stronger than the earthquake in Heidi. Turning to personal auto, agency retention remains strong and the renewal premium change continued to be positive. New business improved significantly, and it was at the highest level in the last five quarters. We believe that the new business declines that we saw in the previous quarters were due to the fact that we were ahead of the market in seeking increased rate. You can see from the change in agency autos quarter-over-quarter combined ratio, that profitability has improved as rate gains are now outpacing the lost cost.  Approximately one point of this improvement was attributable to lower frequency, which we believe was a result of the winter storms impact on miles driven. After normalizing for the quarter\u2019s frequency, core auto margins are improving and well within company targets. Within agency property the story this quarter was clearly the weather. Adjusting for the weather the combined ratio for the quarter was modestly higher compared to the prior year quarter, a portion of which is the expected slight margin compression. This compression continues to be driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles. Agency property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market. It continues to steadily grow with strong retention and continued positive renewal premium change, and new business is up significantly compared to the same quarter last year. So even with an extraordinary number of catastrophic events in the quarter, we posted solid results. Core combined ratios remain within company targets, new business remains robust despite the challenging macro economic conditions; rate overall remains positive and retentions continue to be strong. We believe that these results are direct outcome of long-term capability and competitive advantages we have built, as exemplified by our claim response this quarter. These capabilities are sustainable and will continue to differentiate Travelers with independent agents, customers and brokers. Now before I turn it back to Jay Benet, let me touch on an issue that\u2019s gotten a good bit of press. On page 17, we\u2019ve outlined why we believe our exposure to Chinese drywall will not be problematic. First, from a business profile prospective, we have no direct liability exposure to Chinese drywall manufacturers, and have virtually no general liability exposure to US residential contractors. In fact, we have no general liability exposure to 37 of the 38 US residential contractors identified in Bloomberg, and the one we do right has in SAR and our limits above that are minimal. On the homeowner side, we are disproportionately under represented in the states with significant impacts. So we do not expect the significant number of claims, but given our policy structure limits profile, we believe any losses should be contained. Additionally, the fact that there is very strong product ID here its helpful. That is, we know where it is, where it came from, and when it got here, and all of this should help limit this claim activity. To date we\u2019ve gotten 52 claims and we are comfortable our overall exposure is not problematic. Now with that, let me turn it back to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Page 18 sets forth our guidance for full year 2010\u2019s fully diluted operating income per share, which is a range from $5.20 to $5.55, unchanged from what we previously provided, which in round numbers should translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 11%. We are now assuming cat losses of $640 million after tax or $1.30 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cat losses for the first quarter and our original estimates for quarters two through four. No further estimates of prior year reserved development either favorable or unfavorable; a low single digit decrease in average invested assets ex-unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to share repurchases; full year share repurchases that are still in the range of $3.50 to $4.0 billion; and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases and employee equity awards in the range of $490 million to $495 million shares, which is a bit higher than we what we had previously assumed through the impact of the recent increase in the price of our shares. Before I close, let me explain in response to several questions we have been asked, why we did not prerelease this quarter\u2019s cat losses? We write cat exposures as part of the ordinary course of our business, and cat losses are just one of the number of items that could impact the quarter\u2019s results. We think it is more informative generally to release all of our results together so that the information is presented in context. This is particularly true in a quarter like this, when the cat losses came from a number of relatively smaller events and we have losses from seven cats in the quarter as Brian said, some of which occurred very late in the quarter. It\u2019s also our strong preference to take the time to acquire regular quarterly closing process to our result before we announce. This approach makes more sense for a company of the size that we are now, especially in a quarter when we had a number of moving pieces and our performance on an overall basis was generally consistent with our expectations. Finally this approach is also consistent with the overtime nature of the company\u2019s stated financial objective, and our previously disclosed intention to stop giving guidance beyond this year. So with that, I believe Jay has a closing comment he would like to make.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jay, just one more comment before we open it up to questions. You may have noticed that a number of our senior executives have over the last year or so, sold some of their shares and I wanted to take the opportunity to clarify our views. Our senior executives receive a meaningful portion of their compensation in the form of performance-based equity. As a result of that, as well as our recent performance, all of our named executive officers and substantially all of our senior executives, have equity positions that are well in excess of the company\u2019s ownership requirements. This actually has been the case for quite some time. The recent financial crisis underscored for all of us the importance of prudent personal financial planning and diversification. Given this and our significant executive ownership, we don\u2019t discourage executive sales driven by personal financial decisions, as long as the minimum share ownership requirements continue to be met. With that operator, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Thanks. Jay can you talk about the expectation for continued improvement in the accident year of combined ratios, ex caps. We saw that in the first quarter, and just given the kind of environment, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of whether you anticipate that continuing through the year?\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. I think when we look at each one of the segments, there is probably a bit of a different story. We had talked about some rate gains in the BI segments that had been in our written premium back in the second half of last year, and of course that\u2019ll get earned in along with the rate gains that we have seen in the first quarter. Relative to lost trend, I think as Brian said earlier, the loss trend, it\u2019s running at a benign levels. So probably running a little bit ahead of where the rate gains has been so. We would expect in terms of just the underlying trends in our business, if you see some margin compression of a modest amount in the BI segment. Now if you flip to the other extreme and look at Pi, Pi is in a different position. Pi has been experiencing rate gains for a period of time, and as those earn in and the loss costs remained pretty benign in that business, I think we\u2019d see some margin expansion there, again all things being equal. All of this is going to be dependent upon the weather and loss activity that you heard of talk about from quarter to quarter, but I think just overall slight expansion. Brian do you want to add something there?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, and Jay\u2019s comments there in PI is auto. As I said in my comments, on the home owner\u2019s side, there is a little bit of a margin compression on the auto side; we definitely got to experience it.\nJay Benet: Jay if you go back to the previously issue guidance that we were referring this morning, what we said at that time was that we expected for the organization overall total consolidated, that we expected modest -- I think was the word we used, deterioration in the loss and LAE ratio for the organization overall, and that\u2019s still our underlying premise imbedded in the guidance.\nJay Fishman: The other segment that we should comment on is the FTII segment. Of course there is a very diverse mix of business there, but you can say like BI, perhaps there is a slight level of margin compression as well.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Okay, and then my follow-up is on the expense ratio. Now having told its 33%, are you comfortable with that level of expense ratio, and if so maybe you can talk about what investments are driving that?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, Jay this is Brian. Yes the exact ratio is going to bounce around quarter- to-quarter as premium volumes move and there are other miscellaneous things going through on the expense side. But we have been making significant investments in our platforms across a lot of our businesses, probably the most obvious are in small commercial and in the personal arena where the product and platform are a significant part of our market place proposition. But even the cross middle market we\u2019ve been doing a lot of different things to connect with capabilities that we have in the market place. So that is another area of investment.\nJay Benet: We also get a little reluctant in answering with respect to specific elements of the cost structure. Lost hours are mitigated or generated by investments, so expense and loss ratio which just can\u2019t be looked at, we don\u2019t think in separate pieces so we get back to returns on equity and are we satisfied with our overall returns in our business current returns as well as long term prospects? The answer is yes, we very much are.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS, please proceed.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: Good morning everybody. Two quick questions here for you. First one, Brian can you talk about trends in personal auto insurance and given that your combined ratios now are down to a more than acceptable level? Should we expect to start seeing you guys, that number stabilized and maybe give us some of the dynamics right now in the personal auto insurance market where there are some competitors with really high combined ratios, and then perhaps maybe picking up some share here going forward?\nJay Benet: Yes, we definitely do feel that way. Greg Toczydlowski is sitting here by my throat, have him talk about that a little bit.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes Brian. As he indicated we are feeling comfortable with the margins. We watched two primary factors, that the whole of our quote information, and we can clearly see that our quote flow is off and then we look at the competitiveness of our core activities, specifically in comparative raters and we can see that our closed ratio is also up this quarter. If you look at the stat supplement, you can see the output of that, that we do have sequential gain in TIF from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So as we\u2019ve got those margins right in the middle of the target to where we want them to be, we are going to continue driving that growth and you can see that in some of the data that we reported this quarter.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: Great, and then my second question Jay is, I noticed as you said that you took an extraordinary dividend out of the operating companies this quarter. I am curious, why did you take the extraordinary dividend? Does that also mean that you still have your regular dividend capacity available to you this year, to the holding company?\nJay Benet: Well this is Jay Benet. We ended up in a very very strong position in our operating companies at the end of the year. Profitability in the fourth quarter was extremely strong and we do an analysis of what the capital levels are and decided that we were just over capitalized based on that profitability. So, rather than leaving it there to take out in the normal quarters, we went to the various fixed regulators and show them what our capital levels were and what we wanted to do, and then just asked if we could take it out sooner than later and we did. So it\u2019s just the holding company, so we have the flexibility now going forward, to just execute on our share repurchases and we just think it\u2019s pure management to do that when the operation need to have the excess capital.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: That\u2019s great, and what is your kind of regular dividend capacity available for this year?\nJay Benet: We had about $3.5 billion that we could take out without regulatory approval. I should say though that that becomes, without getting overly complex about it, this is a rolling calculation. To the extent you get regulatory approval and increase the amount that you take out in a quarter, it will change for the reminder of the year, how much you could take out without regulatory approval, but we are confident that whatever we would like to take out of the operating companies, barring the unforeseen catastrophe or whatever, we will be able to do this year.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Walsh from Citi; please proceed.\nKeith Walsh \u2013 Citi: Hey good morning everybody, how are you? First question, just with respect to the guidance. You\u2019ve maintained your projection for the year despite the incremental $0.50 a share in cats, a slightly higher share account, and even if we net out the benefit of the reserved release, is this guidance or better guidance driven by business trends or is it the jump in non-investment income?\nJay Benet: It\u2019s actually kind of more simpler than that, which is that when you look at the results for the first quarter, the $1.25, $1.22 was absolutely consistent with what we had incorporated in our original full year guidance of 520 to 555. So the all in first quarter results were very much consistent with our own number for the first quarter in the annual guidance, and so it\u2019s just a reaffirmation of the same underlying trends.\nBrian MacLean: As you would expect for a company of our size and sophistication, I mean we are constantly looking at what our plans are for the future and in this particular case as Jay said, we\u2019ve incorporated the actual for the first quarter into our revised local investment income, looking at margins going forward and based on hitting what we had expected to be the operating income or thereabouts in the first quarter. We haven\u2019t seen anything that would change the overall look for the rest of the year.\nKeith Walsh \u2013 Citi: And then just regards to the non fixed income part of the portfolio, if you can talk a little bit about the volatility, and I know you try to give maybe a normalized rates of return for that, but what is sort of a long term expected rate of return for that part of the portfolio?\nBill Heyman: Hi this, the Bill Heyman. I guess it begs the question what is long term. We make privately fund investment to the expectation that our capital would be out for an average of seven or eight years, and I don\u2019t think we would make those investments if we didn\u2019t think there was a reasonable chance of low double digit returns, although our estimates are more conservative than that, given their current climate. With respect to hedge funds, which are now only $500 million in a portfolio of $70 billion, the same hurdle is used, but for estimating purposes we\u2019re in the mid high single digits, but over the long term we would require 12% of these asset classes in any size.\nKeith Walsh \u2013 Citi: Okay, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg from Langen McAlenney; please proceed.\nLarry Greenburg - Langen McAlenney: Thank you. Good morning everyone. First I had just a quick clean up question. The tax charge in the quarter, was that in the interest in other line?\nJay Benet: Yes, it was Larry.\nLarry Greenburg - Langen McAlenney: Okay thanks; and then and reserved development, in the SPI line, it appears in the last two quarters, favorable reserved development has jumped up a bit from where it had been running, and I am wondering if there is anything that you might be able to isolate to explain that. Then more generally on reserve development, can you talk about the complexion and the favorable development and whether the balance between reserve releases associated with case or IBNR reserves has changed over the last six quarters or so.\nJay Benet: I will take a shot at it. As it relates to the first part of the question, looking at FDII -- now FDII goes through the same processes as the rest of our businesses. Each quarter we are looking at changes in actuarial views associated with very granular levels of our reserves, and whether it\u2019s in international business or whether it\u2019s in the bond in financial products business we\u2019ll take positive of their reserve development or negative reserve development when see or need to do that. I don\u2019t think there is anything in particular that\u2019s been driving the reserve development in FDII, but it has been depending upon the quarter partly bond and financial products and partly international. The longer the tail associated with the business the more we wait. So I think in the bond and financial products business it\u2019s probably been more of the early 2000 type events that have been reserved for, and we have seen claim activities just doubling out a little lower than what our expectations were. As it relates to just the rest of the businesses, I am not sure I can really answer your question as to whether it\u2019s development on case reserves versus rethinking of the IBNR, because as you know, as times go on, there is less and less IBNR and more cases. So we tend to look at it in its totality, but it\u2019s the same phenomena. Whether it\u2019s looked at by an individual business line or particular accident year, what we are seeing is that time has developed and on some of the longer tail lines we are seeing certainly favorable reserve development dealing with less payments of claims than we anticipated. Some of the development is the roll forward from older accident years to more current accident years, if in fact the reserve analysis is indicating that the original loss text were higher than what they would seem to be, but that\u2019s not the major driver of it. The major driver is just looking at the claim exiting. I hope that responsive to your question.\nLarry Greenburg - Langen McAlenney: Yes, that\u2019s helpful thank you.\nJay Fishman: Can I interrupt for a second. I want to go back and just actually clarify an answer that we gave previously in response to the question about the expense ratio, just as I have been reflecting on it, and I said \u201cwere the returns in our business generally consistent with our expectations to produce long term mid-teens return on equity\u201d that was the sort of shorthand that I was giving you, and I said \u201cyes, they were, we always have lines of business\u201d The returns are not at levels that we want them to be, and we have been consistently public about seeking rate gains where we need them. So I didn\u2019t mean to imply by that answer, that every product that we have met hurdles in every specific way. In a very general sense in responding to the question about the expense ratio overall, we feel pretty good about the overall returns that our portfolio products generate. It certainly doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have products where a competitive environment is such that strategically we are seeking rate, so that we can bring those products either into the range of acceptability and there is a number of those that are not further up into the range of acceptability to meet our long term hurdles. I hope that\u2019s clarifying, but it is really a complex question asked in a very simple way. We can go back to the questions operator thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Oppenheimer; please proceed.\nMichael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer: Thank you. Just a question on the liability business if I could. For recent books, has there been any loss emergence outside your expectation either in 2009 or so far in 2010 and could you talk specifically about the community bank portfolio, thanks.\nJay Benet: Sure, in the more recent years, I think the loss experience in generally as a portfolio across all the management liability business are within expectation. So there is nothing there I would say that a trend surprise.\nMichael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer: Okay great, and then just a question on the commercial business. So if we get a map on renewal plus new business on the commercial segment, it doesn\u2019t quite match up, is that because that renewal rate is calculating based on policy count, and I guess to follow that, does that mean you are getting more growth at the small end of commercial rather than the large end?\nJay Fishman: I am trying to make sure I have got the question straight so when we.\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. The statistics you are referencing aren\u2019t based on policy count, they are based on dollars, premium dollars. If I understand the question, what you are trying to do is look at the sum of the business retains, plus your rates. What your missing is what we had disclosed in the fourth quarter in a bar graph that we presented, what\u2019s the impact of exposure, changes, cancellations, endorsements and audit premium, and that\u2019s what gets you to the dollar amount of the premiums in the first quarter. So if you were to do that with business insurance, what you\u2019d see is about 82% net retain business, another 19% new business, approximately 1% of rate, all of which would have been a 2% increase in net written premium, and what\u2019s taking place is that a negative 6% but waiting to exposure, cancellations, endorsements and audit premiums that translates into the negative 4% overall.\nMichael Nannizzi: Great, thank you very much. And just one last question if I could on leverage, how important is operating near that one to one premium to surplus. Is that a target or is that more just a result of other things that you are doing thanks.\nJay Fishman: It\u2019s absolutely the result. What I have indicated before is that we have the various rating agency models that we apply along with risk based capital, and whether it\u2019s the car ratio or the S&P or Moody\u2019s model or Fitch models, we evaluate what the operating company capital requirements should be for a strong double A company as we are. From that, we then look at the leverage of the holding company the holding company cash to come up with the actual capital position, and the fact that premium to surplus is approximately one to one. It\u2019s not something we look at; it is absolutely the result of that process.\nJay Benet: Let me add a comment and Bryan make sure I am right on this, because we tend to lump them together this exposure, audit premium and it\u2019s the function of the way that our arithmetic is done. There are several different dynamics operating there, but the two principle ones are audit premiums which one should think of as retrospective in nature. Clients make estimates of what their ratable factors at the inceptions of the policy, at the end of the policy we come in and we do an audit. It turns out that the ratable factors that might be payroll, it might be sales, it might be trucks on the road, but it turned out to be less than they had originally anticipated because of the speedy depth of decline in the economy, and so we have an audit premium return of previously written premium to us. We think of that as almost a retrospective adjustment. Then there is imbedded in our renewal business, change in exposure on a renewal basis, which is not always entirely factual, because once again clients make estimates of what their ratable factors will be, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise any of us, if in fact given the economy that there is a tendency at the moment to continue to overestimate if you like, the impact of the economy and so it becomes, and under state the exposure which is something we believe is happening today, but we can\u2019t prove it and we can\u2019t obviously find it in the numbers. It will be interesting as the economy levels out and ultimately returns to what our sense is, that the retrospective audit premium dynamic will be the first to change, because in fact the catch up will occur, and then we will begin to see the renewal dynamic of exposure a little slower and a little bit longer, but those are two very different dynamics of the economy that just tend, given our arithmetic to be lump together, and maybe that\u2019s helpful.\nJay Fishman: One of the other interesting thoughts here as you look at our data, and probably broadly across much of our business, but certainly in the business insurance side we are growing our customer base it\u2019s hard to see in the premium, because our typical and I am not just talking about writing a whole bunch of small ones so the number are larger. We are in the aggregate growing our customer base. The premium is struggling because our typical customer might need a less insurance than they do in normally robust times, and that typically comes through on the AP side, audit premium side. So it\u2019s an important note though that we feel good about this grow.\nJay Benet: It\u2019s a bit forward looking and obviously may not happen, but if in fact we come out of this with more customers than we had coming into it, when the economy does recover, we think we will be reasonably well positioned to anticipate a growth in premium, but a lot of factors that happened obviously for the economy to recover has to continue to stabilize first, but at the very basic core of it, we think we are going to be coming out of this with more business insurance customers than we went coming into it.\nMichael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer: Thanks, very helpful. Thank you so much for the answers.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ninea Mesquite from Credit Swiss; please proceed.\nNinea Mesquite - Credit Swiss: Good morning. On the personal audit front you had sequential fiscal quarter-over-quarter. Could you give us a sense for what the competitive dynamic is within the industry and how you are managing to grow the business the now versus the last three quarters?\nGreg Toczydlowsk: Ninea, this is Greg Toczydlowski. I think in Bryan\u2019s comments he talked about us being in front of some of the rate cycle in late 2008 into 2009, and you can see that in our RPC statistics. We spend quite a bit of time really looking at filing activity across the country and understanding what the competitors are doing in terms of simple metrics like the ratio increases of filings to decreases. We seen an environment where increases are still outpacing decreases, and quite a bit closer to four to one right now. So as we moderate some of our rate; as the market moves with of those, probably to the levels that we were at in 2009, again as I talked about our \u201cenclosed ratios\u201d we can see we are becoming more competitive in the market place and feeling very good about our margins underneath that, and that\u2019s driving some of the sequential growth.\nJay Benet: We just said becoming more competitive. It\u2019s easy to come to the conclusions from that statement that we are low in price. What you really mean is that the pricing that we have established is that the market seems to be catching up to it, that\u2019s an important clarification.\nNinea Mesquite - Credit Swiss: Sure, fair enough. Margins have also improved this year versus last year. Could you give us a sense of whether this is purely because of late or do you think that there is some elements in the lost constraint, either sequence of severity that\u2019s also helping you.\nJay Benet: It\u2019s a combination of both. We have been very disciplined in our pricing in a very segmented level and you can see that in the RPC trends. The lost trend we are watching very closely and some of the mileage driven data and information that\u2019s out there is showing that there has been slight improvement in frequency in the first quarter, and the lost trend is right where our expectations are and we are going to continue with our very focused and disciplined pricing.\nNinea Mesquite - Credit Swiss: That\u2019s great, and one last question if I may. On some of the excess surplus lines players have said that the competition among the standard of players is growing. Could you give us a sense how Travelers is ensuring that they are not ridding business that is normally been written by the excess in surplus lines.\nJay Benet: Yes, we look we watch very closely, who we are taking business from, where its coming from and are very confident that we are not out there writing any significant number of accounts that belong in the E&S market. The one place that I\u2019ll comment; sometimes some competitors who are in that space will talk about people taking account. Sometimes there are accounts that are in that market place, because the agent, that is the only way in the small commercial side they can access markets. So one of the other reasons why business moves out of excess and surplus lines, wholesales businesses into traditional distribution, is the agents hopefully for all appropriate reasons get appointed and come directly to us. But that\u2019s not I think the issue you are talking about, which is there are accounts that belong in that market place because they are complex risks and it shouldn\u2019t be written in standard markets and we are very comfortable but we are not taking that business.\nJay Fishman: And from time to time we will have a program, because we talked about these before, where its written both in expense and surplus markets, as well as in admitted markets and standard markets. So we do have an amount of business that we have had for long time, that\u2019s been around here, programs in particular that are also written in the E&S market, but again to Bryan\u2019s answer, there has been no effort on our part to aggressively move business that is historically been in the E&S market and move it over to us.\nNinea Mesquite - Credit Swiss: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann from JP Morgan please proceed\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Hi, good morning everybody. I was curious if you can just comment on the reinsurance changes you made internationally, and I guess specifically just clarify whether when you say your changing the retention, the retentions is at a similar level to like the US excessive loss treaty, which I think is 500, or relative to capital. You scaled the attachment point similar to where it is in the US.\nJay Fishman: Yes, it\u2019s neither actually. This is on a pro risk basis; we have been keeping lower net retentions internationally than we have in the US, so really just confirming that up a little bit, and then we\u2019ve got some individual cap treaties related to our business at much lower levels. We moved those up a little bit, but from 35 to 70, nowhere near the numbers that you are relating from the US.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: And on the per risk, I mean I guess the order magnitude and I guess I am anecdotally -- I mean is that you are moving from the 40 to 50 on your per risk or I guess can you give some color there?\nJay Fishman: This is taking net per risk from 10 to 15 in one case, and 10 to 12 in another.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Okay, got you, so nothing huge.\nJay Fishman: That\u2019s dollars. That\u2019s $10 million to $15 million per risk or $10 million to $12 millions.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Okay I guess if you translate in that relative to the gross line that was put on the contract, how does the percentage change? How does that translate into percentage I guess?\nJay Fishman: You got to do the math quickly. I mean it varies literally transaction by transaction. If we have a $20 million exposure; instead of having a net pretext 10, we will now have a net pretext 12. If we have a $15 million exposure, instead of having a net pretext 10, we will have a net pretext 12, so it\u2019s specific to the individual loss.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Okay I just wanted to make sure that you weren\u2019t expanding your gross appetite in concert with this or whether it was truly just a net without the gross line changing. That was the only reason I was asking the question.\nJay Fishman: It\u2019s worth just given how accounting works that this change is disproportionate between gross and net in this quarter.\nJay Benet: Yes, in this segment we got a significant portion of the reinsurance that renews, and obviously the premium gets posted in the quarter that it renews, so it\u2019s got a significant impact in the quarter and we\u2019re earning over the year.\nBrian MacLean: There tends to be a presumption that these things happen ratably, and actually it\u2019s not how it works. The requirement is to actually see the entire amount from the gross at inception, not over the policy period so this impact is written, that\u2019s correct. You are looking at it in an annual effect, all being evidenced in one quarter.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Okay, that makes sense, just wanted to make sure. With respect to the industry focused underwriting segment, are there any particular segments that you would highlight as being disproportionate drivers of the pressure in that segment.\nBrian MacLean: What do you say pressure?\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: Well I guess you have seen it looks like the economy is having a bit bigger impact given the rate trends that don\u2019t look dramatically different from the rest of BI segment. That it just looks like it\u2019s suffering a little bit more. So I was just curious if there was any industry classes or segments that you would highlight as disproportionately driving or if it\u2019s just kind of consistent across everything in that segment.\nBill Cunningham: This is Bill Cunningham. The two that comes to mind are constructions and oil and gas. The amount of construction activity on the commercial side is down fairly dramatically, so we are seeing that impact both payroll and revenues for a contractor, and its obviously less drilling on the oil and gas side. So those two classes are certainly disproportionate.\nMatthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan: I appreciate it, thanks\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch; please proceed.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions; the first is, if you could talk more about the new business environment, new business is up year-over-year and commercial accounts down. You made some comments; I am wondering if you can flush that out a little but as far as competitive environment for new business. Then secondly, one topic we haven\u2019t talked about in a long time is asbestos. I hate to just cross it off my list with something to worry about. I am wondering if you can give us an update on what\u2019s happening there.\nBrian MacLean: Hi Jay, this is Brian. I\u2019ll tag team a little bit with Phill Cunningham on the new business side. I assume you\u2019re talking specifically the business insurance there. A couple of different stories; I think the broad one is, we\u2019ve been doing a ton of things in the market place over the last three plus years, to drive more flow and more opportunities, and a bunch of different funds, we have talked about them in the past. That has continued. We feel great about the amount of business that we are seeing in the marketplace, and all we need to do is go through that in a pretty sophisticated way and find opportunities. So broadly middle market, we feel great about it. On the small commercial side, on the small end, the platform that we rolled out in select and our travelers, our express platform there have driven a lot of volume as we would have hoped and we are seeing a lot of opportunity there. The challenge is the GAAP between those and by that I mean what we typically call the higher end of small commercial, where the marketplace is more competitive, and that\u2019s the area where we are taking some pricing actions and seeing lower volumes; pricing actions upward.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Right. On the commercial insurance business, what\u2019s happening to your hit ratios, just to follow up on that.\nBrian MacLean: The hit ratios are down. I mean the overall comment would be the new business environment remains competitive as Brian mentioned. Our flow of opportunities is up and continues to be up year-over-year, month this year compared to month last year. There has been a consistent increase, each month, each quarter. We\u2019ve worked through more opportunities. Our quote ratio is about consistent, an increase in quotes, so go through the pieces. Flow to date just to give you some perspective is up two folds compared to what it was three years ago. So we are seeing that business volume in terms of number of [Inaudible]. We are maintaining about the same quote ratio. So the number of accounts that we are quoting is about double compared to what it was two years ago. The percentage that we are actually getting on order is down.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then any comments in asbestos?\nBrian MacLean: The environment that we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter has been very much the same environment that we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters. There\u2019s literally been no change. I mean we always welcome the day when we could watch a sporting event and not see an advertisement from a plaintiffs attorney talking about asbestos. So that continues in the marketplace, but there really haven\u2019t been any major new developments.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch: Okay, I\u2019ll put it down on my list then. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nJosh Shanker - Deutsche Bank : Thank you. He asked my question, but I didn\u2019t know how to get of the queue, but I\u2019ll ask another one. The advertising spend; how do you guys think about the payback in advertising spend and is it meeting your objectives?\nJay Fishman: The advertising spend, you can look at it in two separate pieces. There is an element of it that\u2019s pure brand, and the spending that we\u2019ve done in that over the last several years has been long term investment oriented, not action driven. The ramp up that we had in advertising has been very specifically behind our direct to consumer business where we are doing a lot more. The short story on our direct to consumer personal initiative is that it is a long term program. We said that we would loose money on the way; we\u2019ve continued to have loosed money on it. In terms of driving customers from India to a coding process that\u2019s been actually pretty encouraging. So in the context of the effectiveness of the advertising, if the measure of it is the response that people have to it, that\u2019s actually been pretty good. Then the mix of earnings that we\u2019ve had and we\u2019ve spoken about it -- mix earnings we have to take on in learning how to convert that response into higher numbers of quotes and ultimately into higher number of sales, and in that arena we still have, about consistent with our expectations, we have a long way to go before this becomes a successful business venture.\nJosh Shanker - Deutsche Bank : Some of your competitors, very few of them say that they have a brand advantage in the commercial line. Do you think that the advertising can help with that for travelers? Do you see any indication from your customers that they are identifying with the brand on the commercial side.\nJay Fishman: I think the best way that we can answer that, and of course this is all anecdotal and could be wrong, but if you sit with the group of agents, particularly those in our business insurance arena, they all are aware of the advertising efforts that we\u2019ve undertaken, they are comment on it, and they all say that it makes the job easier. Now they could be just talking that, just telling us that and not have it de-substantive, but it is pretty clear to us that the agents do indeed see it, they appreciate it, and at least as they described to us, its helpful to them. I don\u2019t know if is the specific answer with respect to customers. If you do watch branch record data and we do but again this is a very long term venture for us and I don\u2019t want to over react to either good news or bad news in that regard. But branch record data would suggest that our advertising is being effective in terms of customer recognition. Now that\u2019s predominantly in the personal side, but again these are all long term efforts to accomplish something overtime.\nJosh Shanker - Deutsche Bank : Well, good luck for that and congratulation on the quarter.\nJay Fishman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Adage Capital, please proceed.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: Hi, I guess two questions. First one is can you talk a little bit about the decline in non-cat. Well I guess that surprised me. You know [Inaudible] 50 seats at the same time and not on 50 of those states were cat. I would have thought non-cat and cat weather would be up this quarter, but even we both were saying that non-cat was down so is it a categorization thing or last year things were just below the cap threshold and this year they do a lot of events just above or\u2026?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, this is Brian. I think the fundamental dynamic is the last point you are making, which is this quarter -- the little tiny silver lining around the big dark clouds was the events were so bad that they all flipped into the getting categorized as a cat event. So our normal first quarter flow of weather events is always there, because there is always no storms and there is always a little bit of wind and there is always some of that, most of that got lumped into a cat and therefore we\u2019ve got our offsetting benefit.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: Got it, okay.\nJay Fishman: And that was the primary reason why we try to be very transparent on the fact that there was favorable non-cat weather. We think it\u2019s important that you understand what the underlying dynamics are in the business and be able to look at combined ratios with that in line.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: No, exactly. That\u2019s why I just wanted to make sure that that one we are looking at are ex-cat, but there is a little bit of moving pieces in there so I appreciate that. My other question is on auto. I guess, can you help me get more comfortable that the 95 this quarter is a sort of that you are sustainable back below 96, and the reason I ask it that way is, each of the last couple of years you\u2019ve been that 98, 99 and there has been a quarter in there that\u2019s below 96 then you go right back up. To be honest, when I look at your reserve triangles for auto ,you\u2019ve had development in the last couple of years, your paid and our trends frankly look a little weaker than your peers, but on the other hand obviously you\u2019ve got price incoming through. I mean sort of where are we are, are we comfortable below 96 or is it we are hopeful and we need a couple of more quarters to see.\nBrian MacLean: So a couple of couple pieces Ian, and Greg you can chime in. As I said in my comment we got about a point of good news running through there because of the weather impact on frequency. So the 95 and change is we think from a run rate perspective a little bit understated. We have been taking some right actions as we\u2019ve talked about and we are seeing now that that rate is exceeding loss costs, so we are expanding our margins there and we feel good about it. There also is seasonality in how the ratios come through and that\u2019s one of the reasons why they do bounce around a bit. Greg if you want to...\nGreg Toczydlowski: No just to comment on that seasonality, we typically see in the first quarter a little lower relativity and we certainly talking about the fourth quarter about a much higher relativity. So when you consider all that in the Brian\u2019s comment on the rate offsetting some of the loss trend and Jay\u2019s comment about we have target ranges of return on capital for this line, based on all that we feel like the product is right in the middle of where we want to of those targets that we feel comfortable with it.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: Okay. So as may be a fair way to say that it may not be below 96 every quarter but hopefully its 96 for the year end price keeps coming through?\nBrian MacLean: We certainly price the product on a longer intuitive basis, yes. It\u2019s very difficult to do it at a quarterly level, and the ranges that we look at overall in terms of profit targets for the product line is closer to the 96 to 99 range. So when we consider all of that, we feel like we are right in inside those targets.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: I guess the one thing that surprises me is, even if I take Brian\u2019s comment and it\u2019s just 95 back to 96, I guess and some seasonality. We\u2019re just seeing a big drop from where the four \u201909 year was and I would have though the earned pricing would have come in more gradually unless there are some other benefits you are seeing.\nBrian MacLean: Yes, I think we might have started that if you are looking at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, particularly sequentially you have the fourth quarter which has the higher loss contents associated with it, and then you slip into the first quarter which has by its nature and the seasonality factors the lower loss contents. You have to see it develop over few more quarters I think.\nJay Benet: Yes, and its a little bit of pattern stated when you are looking at quarter over quarter of this year. For the 2009 period we did have some adverse activity in the first quarter of 2009 for the fourth quarter of 2008. So when you adjust some of that which we really look at more in and actually here the help of the business, the trend certainly come from.\nBrian MacLean: I think the bottom line here Ian without giving you a precise number for what we think the full year auto is going to be, we feel better about the auto line. There were some unusual seasonal things going through, but we feel good about the rate we are getting in the lost cost or controls and relative to where we\u2019ve been, we see some real improvement here.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: Great. That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Rob Bobbin from Capital Returns. Please proceed.\nRobin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns: Hi. I\u2019ve got a question with your large business is and I was wondering how much hard and soft capital supports your large business is and explicitly how much in the way of LLC do you use to make up that those amounts?\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. There is a fair amount of LLC supporting the Lloyds business. I think proportionally its probably about 80% LLC are relative to hard capital.\nRobin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns: And where are the actual dollar numbers?\nJay Benet: I am struggling with the number. I think it\u2019s in our tag. $500 million is what I was remember. A little less than that but it\u2019s about $500 million. It will go up and down based upon the instructed writing with Lloyds.\nRobin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns: What\u2019s the capital approximately, what\u2019s the LLC number?\nJay Benet: It\u2019s the LLC number.\nRobin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns: Okay.\nJay Benet: 474, $474 millions on page 117 of the cat.\nRobin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns: Approximately, Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Ms. Nawi there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.\nJay Fishman: We are all finished. We thank you all for your attention. We hope that this format was more responsive to your need. Let us know if its not. We can do it differently to be helpful to you, and thank you all for your time and attention.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased that we posted solid results in the fourth quarter with net income per share at $1.51 and return on equity of 10%. The story for the full year, of course, was the remarkable weather. Weather losses were far and away the worse in our history, and as a consequence, net earnings per share of $3.36 for the year were considerably lower than what we've become accustomed to. Nevertheless, we price our product for the long term, and of course, we don't control the weather. There will be years such as 2006 and '07 in which weather losses are surprisingly low, and of course, there will be years, but hopefully not too many, in which losses will be high.  Also a less financially significant, but nonetheless important piece of the 2011 story was the persistent low fixed-income investment environment. A 1.5 years ago, in the middle of 2010, we made the important decision that we were going to actively take steps in terms of rate terms and conditions to improve future returns in light of the insurance pricing environment and our view that it was increasingly likely that we would be facing low fixed-income yields for some time to come. We increased those efforts in the middle of 2011 in recognition of the possibility that weather patterns might be changing prospectively for the worst, particularly given the active weather we experienced in 2010 and into the first half of 2011.  We've shared with you before that we are just not big believers in magic market cycles. We understand that our business is about one underwriter and one agent discussing one account at a time. But we believe that our franchise were strong enough that we could seek improved profitability through improved rate terms and conditions without adverse effect to our business. And 18 months later, we have proven that to be the case in most of our commercial businesses. We take these actions selectively where analytics suggest they are warranted, and we try very hard never to be disruptive to our agents or insureds. In our judgment, the success we've experienced speaks to the value that we bring to agents and customers and the success we've had positions the company very well going into 2012. In particular, Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, had a pure renewal rate gain of more than 6% for the quarter and 8% for December. As a result, given our current view of loss trends, we anticipate widening of the underlying underwriting margins in Business Insurance in the first half of 2012.  In Personal Insurance, the regulatory environment is such that while the progress we've made is important, the real evidence of success remains ahead of us as we continue to roll out the pricing and underwriting changes that we have decided to pursue. But I want to emphasize that the steps we are taking are not limited to rate. There are a number of levers available to us in addition to rate as we pursue improved returns. It include underwriting actions, particularly with respect to risk selection and location, as well as changing underwriting standards with respect to roofs and loss history in Personal Insurance. We've always been attentive to our expense base and we continue to be very thoughtful in that regard.  Our commitment to improving perspective returns in Personal Insurance is no less than that which we had in Business Insurance when we began this program 18 months ago. Every personalized franchise is unique. Every company's agent group is different, and importantly, the value proposition to the insureds is quite different company to company. We believe that we will be successful given our agents, our insureds and the value that we bring. So while the bottom line financial results this year were less than we would hoped, we couldn't be more pleased and more proud of our people when we look at the progress we've made to achieve improved returns, particularly given the difficult environment that continues to confront the U.S. economy.  We have really demonstrate the value of the Travelers franchise to agents and insureds as well as the strength and diversity of the business that has allowed us to achieve all that we have over the past 18 months. We ran the business for the long term and focus on returns over time. We're also pleased and proud that since 2005, we've generated an average annual upgrade and return on equity of 13%. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks, Jay. Let me begin by stating that we have maintained our strong cash position, ending the year with holding company liquidity of $2.4 billion. Operating cash flow is $351 million for the quarter, which included unusually high claim payments that resulted from this year's severe weather and $150 million payment to our qualified pension plan that even in this very low interest environment kept our funding level close to 90%. And consistent with an ongoing capital management strategy, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our common stock, which was at the top of our previously announced range and paid $166 million in dividends, bringing year-to-date common stock repurchases to $2.9 billion and year-to-date dividends to $669 million. As was the case this quarter, there have been many periods during the past several years in which our share repurchase and dividends significantly exceeded our earnings. We achieved this by diligently and systematically identifying opportunities to free up capital, returning that freed-up capital to our shareholders.  After several years of working at it, the process of freeing up capital is now largely complete so we now expect the future common share repurchases will be driven more by future earnings levels, taking into account capital needed for business growth and corporate needs such as death service and pension obligations. Having said that, we remain fully committed to identifying and returning excess capital shareholders, whatever the source.  I'd also like to point out that all of our capital ratios remain at or better than target levels at the end of the year. Net unrealized investment gains increased by $337 million during the quarter to $4.4 billion pretax or almost $2.9 billion after tax and book value per share rose to $62.32, a 7% increase since the beginning of the year. So now let me turn the microphone over to Brian to go through the results in more detail.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. I'll start with Business Insurance, and the real news in this segment is that the rate on the business we are writing is up significantly in the last 6 months and is now meaningfully exceeding our current view of loss trend.  Renewal premium change of 8% for the quarter included pure rate increases of over 6%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter that Business Insurance has seen positive rate change on renewed accounts, and as with recent quarters, rate increase across all product lines, with the largest increases in workers' comp and auto. We are very pleased that the months within the quarter continue to show sequential improvement in pricing with December renewal premium change of 10% and pure rate increase of 8% for the segment. And based on our preliminary look at January business, pure rate gain looks pretty similar to what we achieved in December.  Net written premiums were up year-over-year, driven by pricing gains and positive audit premiums. Retention and new business levels were solid, though down somewhat from recent quarters. As we mentioned last quarter, execution on our pricing strategy may impact business volumes going forward, and so far we continue to remain very comfortable with a balance between improved pricing and volume.  Through 2011, this has been a very easy call. I want to emphasize here that when we speak about pricing strategy, our goal is not simply to increase the price on every account. It's a very granular approach based on analytics where we're looking for the appropriate price for the individual risk or the class of business. It's never been a one-size-fits-all approach.  Turning to losses. Overall loss trend was relatively benign. In workers\u2019 comp, we saw some higher-than-expected frequency from 2010. In commercial auto, 2009 and 2010 bodily injury and 2011 physical damage losses were above our initial expectation. So some movement in loss trend concentrated in the 2010 accident year, but more than offset by increased prices.  In summary, we feel extremely positive about the results in Business Insurance. And in our current pricing levels, we believe that we will be generating underlying underwriting margin expansion beginning in the first half of 2012.  In the Financial, Professional & international Insurance segment, operating income of $152 million for the quarter was very strong and consistent with the prior year quarter. This caps a very good year for the segment with full year earnings up more than 4% over what was a good 2010 result.  In surety, we continue to see strong margins and slightly less volume driven by sluggishness in construction spending. We could not be more pleased that we've been able to maintain our current position as the market leader in this business during a very challenging economic environment without a meaningful increase in losses. That we have done so speaks volumes about our ability to select risks, the credit quality of this business and our approach of running this business for the long term.  Looking at management liability. This remains a line of business where market pricing continues to be challenged, but less so at the smaller end, which is the source of most of our premium. While our pricing here has lagged most of our other businesses, we were able to achieve positive renewal premium change for the second quarter in a row. This is reflective of favorable production results in our private and non-profit business and is due in part to benefits from recent technology investments.  In international, net written premiums were down quarter-over-quarter due primarily to the timing of a few small reinsurance transactions and our exit from the personal lines of business in Ireland. Over the past several years, we have increased our focus on our international operations, and we are pleased with the progress to date. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in the underlying loss ratio more than offset the increase in the expense ratio, which is a good sign that the investment is paying off.  In Personal Insurance. Looking at auto profitability, the story is essentially the same as discussed for commercial auto. We've seen a moderate increase from expectations in bodily injury severity for the most recent accident years and the higher-than-anticipated level of claim frequency in severity in the physical damage coverages for the 2011 accident year. The quarter-over-quarter impact of these items both from prior year and 2011 prior quarters was almost 6 combined ratio points. Because of this volatility and the normal seasonality in the quarter, we think a better way to focus on the run rate of the business is to look at the full year combined ratio, which after adjusting for cats and prior-year development, was 99.5. This includes 1 point directly attributable to higher non-cat weather-related losses. And so 98.5 is our view of the current run rate, which is only 2 to 3 points higher than the combined ratio required to get us back to our historical target return. As Jay mentioned, we are committed to improving returns in this product in 2012 by aggressively pursuing rate and implementing local underwriting strategies.  In Homeowners and Other, profits were once again down in the quarter due primarily to adverse weather. Although, the impact of the weather in the fourth quarter was dramatically less than in recent quarters, it was still slightly higher than expectations, driven by the unusual northeast October snowstorm. In addition, we did have some increased claim activity in the non-cat weather from earlier in the year.  As we have said many times, we obviously don't know what the weather will be in 2012, but given the experience of the last several years, we are managing the business with the expectation that weather losses may continue to run above longer term historical averages. Accordingly, we are taking a broad-based assertive approach to managing the property product, which includes not only executing local pricing strategies but also seeking to tighten underwriting standards and changes in terms and conditions.  As examples, we are underwriting for age and quality of roof, re-assessing how we factor in the number and type of previous claims and implementing higher minimum deductibles for weather and non-weather claims. Additionally, we are changing a small portion of our re-insurance program to create a structure that better responds to higher frequency, lower severity events. So we are taking a lot of actions in homeowners and are confident that these actions will further enhance the long-term profitability of our industry-leading franchise.  Turning to production. For both Agency Auto and Property, renewal premium changed and retention remains strong while new business continues to trend down slightly as we accelerate our pricing, underwriting and terms and conditions action. With that, I'll open it up to.\nGabriella Nawi: Carlos, you can open it up for Q&A now.\nOperator: Yes, ma'am. Ma'am would you like me to read the Q&A instructions now?\nGabriella Nawi: No. It's okay. You can open -- you can open it up to questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Ma'am, would you like me to go to the first question?\nGabriella Nawi: Yes, please.\nOperator: And the first question comes from the line of Keith Walsh with Citi.\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Couple of questions. First, Business Insurance. You've alluded to in the press release the underwriting margin, it looked like it would potentially improve in the first half of '12. Is this more optimistic than what you guys talked about last quarter where you seem to be a lot more adamant that this would take time to earn in over the next 12 months? And then I've got a follow-up.\nJay S. Fishman: Well, Keith, this is Jay. The rate that we earned -- the rate that we wrote -- I'm sorry, the rate we wrote in the fourth quarter was obviously at a higher level than that which we wrote in the third quarter. So going into 2012, as we look out into 2012 as it earns, we are not more optimistic because that implies an attitude. This is fact. The fact is, the rate in the fourth quarter was higher than the rate in the third. So wherever we were in the third quarter with respect to margins, we're better off today, and it will simply take the time to earn that written premium into earn. So I'd say that it's not a matter of optimism, meaning feeling, it's really a matter of arithmetic and fact. We're in a better position today than we were at the end of the third quarter with respect to the speed with which those margins will expand, and assuming that we continue to earn rate at this level, the effect that it will have in the margin arena.\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then just sticking with Business Insurance. Obviously, the rates are good, but let's focus on the other part of the game here. I guess, the retention in new business which are both pretty -- down pretty sharply on the new business side, especially. So what are the dynamics of not just the accounts you're keeping, which we can see in the rate, but what about the accounts you are losing? What's really going on there? If you could talk about new business hit rate. Thanks.\nJay S. Fishman: First, I would disagree categorically with your characterization of this down sharply. The retention in Business Insurance for the fourth quarter was at 81%...\nJay S. Benet: 79%.\nJay S. Fishman: I'm sorry. 79%. 79% was commercial. 79%. In the context of thinking about business long term, that's still an exceptionally high retention rate. I mean, we've gotten used to rates in those mid-80s that, frankly, we've never ever seen before. If you go back to the period in the late '90s and early 2000s and middle market retention, we struggled to get it above a number that started with a 7. So what's happening on the Business Insurance side is really -- it's just fine. This is an easy trade-off. The one segment of the business where retention has been lower than others has been in the larger end of Select, right? You may recall that we define Select as the smallest end, which is highly technological. And then there's Express Plus, which is the larger end of Select. That category remains a more challenging pricing environment. It has to do with the way we think that regionals compete and how they view middle market pricing. They don't have the technology to really compete effectively at the low end of small commercial. They don't have the infrastructure to compete effectively at the true middle market business that we define, so they tend to land in that larger end segment. We've established our own thresholds for return expectations, and to the extent that we can capture business that meets those return thresholds, we'll take it, and to the extent somebody else decides they want to take it away from us at a lower price, that's just fine. We're -- so far, this has gone better than I think any of us would have expected 18 months ago. And the trade-off at this point between return gains and retentions, as we described it, is losses. It's just fine. What was the 81%? The 81% was...\nBrian W. MacLean: 81% was Commercial Accounts...\nJay S. Fishman: Commercial accounts, yes...\nBrian W. MacLean: Overall -- this is Brian. Overall in retention, x the high end of Select, we are right around 80%, a little bit north of 80%, and we feel great about that. On the new business front, we're going to look at business in the marketplace and if we can find stuff that meets our return thresholds, we're going to write it. And in this environment, we're not going to search below that.\nJay S. Fishman: I'd make other observation -- and it's more challenging for us in quantify it and demonstrate it, but we have indicators that will support what I'm about to say. New business pricing is also better than it was. It's part of the measure because you simply don't have the prior-year expiring premium to compare it, but we are comparing new business pricing against the manual rate that we construct. And when you look at that pattern, there are 2 things that are really encouraging. One is that there's clearly lift going on. And two, that the gap between -- and I'm not speaking necessarily about this particular quarter, but looking at it over a longer period of time here, 6 , 8 months, the gap between renewal and new has narrowed. And so both of those things give us a pretty good sense of confidence that the pricing for new business is lifting as well. Can't quite quantify it with the level of precision that we can renewal, but we feel awfully good about it.\nBrian W. MacLean: The one comment last comment I'd make on new is that our flow is still very solid. So if this was a matter of we weren't getting opportunity to quote on business and we weren't quoting, we'd be a lot more concerned with that. So we feel good about the flow, we feel good about our activity in the marketplace and profitably levels will be where they will be.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Two questions, both related to pricing. Can you talk about your desire in 2012 to continue to push for rate on the commercial side? Because obviously, you've achieved a certain amount of rate already. Is that desire still very much in place? Or will you be satisfied now where the priced ROEs are and you don't need to push as much? That's question number one. And then secondly, if you could describe the dialogue you're having with agents and brokers. Obviously, your effort is to improve profitability, improve returns, theirs is to do the best for their clients. How much pushback or are you getting from the agents and have you sensed a change in that pushback?\nJay S. Fishman: Jay, I'll take on the first one. No, our strategy now remains as is. We're going to continue to do this selectively, thoughtfully targeted, but we are going to continue. And our goal -- we get asked all the time, \"What's the target?\" We don't have one. And that's partially because some of the conditions that we're responding to were just not as clear to us as they might be. I'm speaking specifically about weather. I'm speaking about investment returns. And so we're going to try and drive our products and our returns back to the historical kind of broad-based targets. We still have a mid-teens ROE as a -- long term. We talked about it over time, but we still very much have that as a long-term target. We are most certainly, from an individual pricing basis, this is important now, I'm not speaking about the return on equity in the whole place, I'm getting very granular with you in talking about the returns on allocated capital of individual products based upon the rate that we have in place today and our immediate view of loss trend. We are getting closer. We are making real progress in getting back to the levels that will ultimately convert it to mid-teens ROE on a GAAP basis. So we got some to go yet but we are encouraged and we're going to keep driving until we find whether we can or not get back to our historical kind of return thresholds. So that's, I think, the answer with what does 2012 feel like from a strategic and tactical perspective. [indiscernible] Bill Cunningham to talk about the agent arena.\nWilliam E. Cunningham: Good morning. I would say on overall basis, we look at our agent relationships as very strong partnerships and as being a strong partner, not surprising them is critical. So being upfront early in the process with our agent in terms of what we're doing on an overall basis, but more importantly, as Brian mentioned, this is not a one-size-fits-all. So every account communicated to the agent as early in the process as possible because our ultimate goal is together, to be out with the client, explaining why we need a given rate increase on a given transaction. At the same time, we do -- from time to time, agents feel a need to test where we're coming from, so they give them time to do that. But I would tell you on an overall basis, it has been very positive in terms of the feedback we received and how we've handled it. And so again, partnership early in the process, no surprises, together sitting down with the customer whenever possible and not putting them in a position where their back is against the wall is key to our partnership.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of questions here for you. First, going back to the auto insurance results that you're seeing in the quarter. When you talked about the 98.5 and need to get it down to a 96, I guess, the question I have there is, one, kind of what are you doing to get it down there? Is it just pure rate? And is the market kind of receptive of the type of rate that you need to get it back down to those 96 levels? And then I have one follow-up.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Brian, these is Greg Toczydlowski. In terms of the auto strategy, predominantly, a rate strategy that we're focused on automobile. When Jay and Brian talked about all the other levers that we're looking at from an underwriting in terms of conditions, we're focused a little more on the property side of the house with that. So we're monitoring our competitive position all the time and given the regulatory environment that we live in, it takes a little bit of time before we can get that rate grow, but we're feeling that we're continuing to see good flow and good retention numbers and we'll continue looking at that as we go forward with the business.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: But obviously, if you're writing at a 98.5, 99, that's not your kind of an acceptable return level. They can't get a double-digit ROE off of that, right?\nGreg Toczydlowski: That is correct. We are shooting closer to that combined ratio that you threw off [ph] in 96 and we're going to be doing that through pricing.\nJay S. Fishman: And some of the dynamics, Brian, that we've been experiencing we suspect are more broad-based. This is just one. But it's -- some unusual -- the pattern has developed with the slowdown of the new automobile business generally. Price of used cars has risen. If the price of used cars has risen, what's been interesting is the number of accidents that result in total losses, where the car produces salvage, have actually gone down. The car relative value up. Auto repair cost much less so more cars are being put back on the road. And a consequence, we've seen of that is an increase in sheet metal cost. I'm not talking about new sheet metal. I'm speaking now about replacement parts. And that's not unique to us. That's going to be a condition that's going to affect lots of people. Now it may impact us a tad more because we tend to write more comprehensive coverage than some other carriers do, so we may be on a more extreme side of that. But the kinds of things that we're seeing are not things that -- it's very important, are not things that indicate problems with underwriting or risk selection. They are more episodic issues with respect to specific costs that are not, I would say, unique to us . So our hope is, and of course, we are going to find out, that we can go to the market and drive the kinds of rate increases that will bring this back, just like we did in Business Insurance. We started extremely slowly. We started 18 months ago asking fundamentally if our folks can get 1 point. That's what we said. Let's see if we can get 1 point, and we've built on that every month. We're going to take that same systematic, thoughtful and patient approach to auto insurance and homeowners and see what progress we can make.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then question for Brian. When you mentioned pure rate also up 8%, can you define that? Is that just rate less cost inflation?\nBrian W. MacLean: No. When we say pure rate, we're looking at the components of the premium change.\nJay S. Benet: No exposure.\nBrian W. MacLean: So it's the rate charged per -- exposure on that, on the average renewal.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. And then how would that compare to what loss cost inflation kind of looks like in the quarter?\nBrian W. MacLean: We don't peg the exact number, but we've said we're meaningfully exceeding it.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. Excellent. And then just lastly, Interest rate assumption when you're talking about getting rate, getting close to your kind of historical kind of double-digit ROE targets, what are you thinking about the interest rate environment?\nJay S. Fishman: Mechanics on that are that all new money is discounted at the current yield curve, basically, where we invest money today, and the surplus embedded in the business in that calculation is a more historical element premised on the fact that we have surplus that rolls off from old products and then comes on to support new. But importantly, we're not kidding ourselves the investment return. That's all new money at all new -- at current yield curve today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: The first question is on pricing. We've seen pricing and workers compensation and commercial auto up sharply because of high loss cost trends. Curious about what are trends you've seen in pricing and other lines that you're pushing this year versus last year?\nBrian W. MacLean: So a couple of just clarifications on that. The comp and the auto, we have the strongest rate improvement. It's not just because we're seeing -- or it's not because we're seeing sharp increases in loss cost there. Obviously, pricing always has something to do with the loss cost trend, but it's not a sharp increase. We saw a fairly significant increase of a couple of points, really, on almost every single line of business we write. So this isn't an example where comp is spiking up dramatically. Auto's up a lot and everything else is kind of flat. I would say every line in the commercial space is moving comp and auto more dramatically, but it's not completely out of pattern with everything else.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Are you talking about rate?\nBrian W. MacLean: Rate. I'm talking about rate change.\nJay S. Fishman: And as Brian reminds all of us, and you as well. In many of our lines of business. It's very much a state-by-state story. There tends to be this view that it's one national rate. It's not. There are states where either frequency or severity underlying trends are either more concerning or less concerning than others. So our reaction with respect to rate and what we're trying to accomplish is very much driven by the state environment, specific to that particular risk.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Fair enough. That's helpful. As a follow-up, what is the impact of non-cat to weather for all the segments? I believe for the personal lines, it was 2 years for the full year.\nBrian W. MacLean: Non-cat weather? I'm looking at Greg. Non-cat weather in PI for the full year. Can we disclose that level of granularity, I guess, is the question.\nGreg Toczydlowski: It's not something that we've disclosed previously. We obviously have some view of it, but the substance of that answer is functionally dependent upon whether our assumption of normal weather is right or wrong or high or low. So rather than trying to get into a debate of how much was non-cat weather, we just -- that's just -- it's internal, and I'm not sure the data is all that meaningful.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. Fair enough. And just one last thing, if I may, what -- to what amount of rate increase do you think on the personal auto line do you think will be necessary for you to get to your level of profitability that you're targeting?\nJay S. Benet: Well, the arithmetic is actually pretty simple. In Personal Insurance, if we want to drive the combined ratio down by 2 points, we got to get about 3 points of rate above and beyond what we otherwise would, because we are obviously in effect, I'd say, always getting rate. That's not universally true. But fundamentally, it's a business where the renewal price change has always been positive. I can't recall that it ever went to a [indiscernible]...\nGabriella Nawi: Up 2 to 3 points.\nJay S. Benet: So that's really the dynamic of kind of 3 points of rate above and beyond we would otherwise get, and under the presumption that loss trend stays about where it is. So there's an all other things being equal dynamic. But the answer to that is it's not as far away as it might otherwise see. Now the marketplace will have to say whatever it wants to say and we're obviously aware of that. And our influence, our market consequence, our breadth in Business Insurance is I think one of the attributes that's enabled us to accomplish what we did in PI whether -- we'll see whether that same dynamic holds true in personal in the same way. But it's just not that far off.\nBrian W. MacLean: Just jumping back to his first question because we have answered part of this in the past, so on the non-cat weather. I mean, we said last quarter in Business Insurance, and it's still probably about the right number, is there's a point in the combined ratio of variance above a normal non-cat weather number for the year. I said -- in the quarter, it was pretty flat in BI, but for the year, it' still about 1 point. In auto personal lines, I said there was a point of clearly identifiable non-cat weather it might actually be more in auto. And the Whole number, I don't remember off the top of my head.\nGreg Toczydlowski: They are going to go on a same basis. Full year property would be closer to 2 to 3 points.\nBrian W. MacLean: Variance from a non-cat weather.\nJay S. Fishman: From whatever we [indiscernible] coming back to the notion of...\nBrian W. MacLean: Whatever was normally our view of normal and weather always been.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Two questions for you. The first is on the share buyback pace for 2012. Should we be thinking about buybacks being equal to net income, operating earnings, retained earnings, can you just clarify?\nBrian W. MacLean: Well, what we were trying to say was, it should be looked at based on earnings, so not retained earnings for sure. And then net income versus operating income, they are both income and they have tended to be relatively similar. So we think mostly in terms of operating income but if they were large realized gains or something, we would take that into account as well, but that would be more episodic.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. I just want to confirm. And then what's the sort of maximum comfort level on debt to capital x the unrealized gains?\nJay S. Benet: We've talked in the past about -- for AA company like us it's being in the 15% to 25% range. We are at a little over 23%. Part of the 23% is actually driven by prefunding $250 million of debt that's going to mature in 2012. So that's worth about 7 basis points in that calculation. But being within that range is a very comfortable place for us.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Got you. And then the final one is on the non-fixed income, after-tax earnings, it was down in 4Q versus 3Q. I'm just try to figure out what you feel would be a reasonable run rate heading into this year.\nWilliam H. Heyman: Jay, Bill Heyman. For what it's worth, the quarter came in just about exactly where we thought the quarter would come in on October 1 as we look to the matrix of factors which affect returns in the non-fixed income portfolio. I suspect the best way to make predictions about the future is to look at the bar graph. Back a few years, try to draw a mean, I figured that's about what we'll make because if we couldn't make that, we probably wouldn't maintain the portfolio. For what it's worth, there were no real surprises in the fourth quarter. This was about what we expected.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. So if I look at that over the past couple of years, probably averaging around $50 million to $65 million a quarter?\nBill Malugen: I'd have to look at the bar graph. I think on the low side of that.\nJay S. Benet: This is Jay. It's one of those things, as you know, it's really difficult to predict. So whatever you put in your model, there is a level of uncertainty. We have great visibility into the fixed-income part of the portfolio but this is going to be so dependent upon what the economy does.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to dig into the workers comp line for a bit, just get some color on the market, and I guess, more specifically, one of your competitors in Hartford has had -- has had some trouble -- some emerging troubles grow through 2011 in that line. Some other cracks are appearing from other competition. I know you don't believe in the cycle but what are you seeing specifically in that line? How do they manage their books of business different? And why are you so confident that this won't begin to have some issues into '12 and beyond?\nJay S. Fishman: Let me talk for a second about -- in a little more specific, what we're seeing. I'm not going to comment on how other companies might be managing their business but we can talk certainly about how we manage ours. So just to be clear on workers comp, what we saw this year, in the aggregate, continues to be a pretty strong picture for us. So if you look at the prior years, '02 through '09, every year continued to perform better than we had expected. So positive in every one of those years. In 2010, we did see...\nJay S. Fishman: Bill said to me yesterday, and make sure you still believe this, that if you look back to '02, the current expected loss outcome in each of the year '02 through '09 is currently lower than the original estimate at the time we made it.\nJay S. Benet: Better. Lower loss ratio, better result, right.\nJay S. Fishman: '02 through '09. So in 2010, we did see some continuation of the increase in late reported claims that we discussed in the second quarter. And we believe this is really a direct result of the impact of the great recession on workers comp claim reporting patterns. And so the 2010 year was out of pattern. But overall, all years, including 2010, we continue to have positive development on our overall workers comp book. The impact of all of that is fully reflected in not just 2010, but rolled into how we look at 2011 and what we booked there. And most importantly, is completely rolled into our pricing the products today. And given the pricing improvements that we've gotten, we feel good about the returns and the profitability levels of the comp business we're writing today. Now as Bill said before, it's a state-by-state game and very, very granularly managed.\nJay S. Fishman: And I've got a couple of other facts that I think would be helpful. First, the magnitude of the 2010, I'll call it, excess claim activity, to put a number on it, it was under $100 million after-tax. That's the -- that's the magnitude of that change. And again, what we see -- everything that we see tells us that those were occurring to dates, incidents in '10 that didn't manifest themselves until 2011. That's an unusual dynamic and something we haven't seen before. Maybe it's a function of the economy and how people feel about job security and whether they raise their hands or not. And again to Brian's point, we've rolled that forward into the 2011 loss estimate, book that fully and are currently incorporating that into our 2012 estimate for pricing and reserving. And this is -- I think it's important because it will, again, help quantify it. The combination of the rate gains and the loss trends and the positives and negatives and everything else, our estimate of that allocated return on capital measure that we use to measure the profitability of the products in workers\u2019 comp all-in now is low double digits. It's low double digits. So it's, I think, it's helpful to put a perspective on what we saw. Now our view on that 2010 development is that it's more, I'll call it timing rather than a permanent change. And of course, we'll see whether that's the case or not. To get back to your other question about -- and of course, you all know this, you're sophisticated analyst, you get it. The issue of how one company reports versus another. The critical element in all this is what did the company generally assumed? And so whatever experience we have in the loss arena is sort of one thing. But what original assumptions were made is a critical element in determining the embedded health of the business and I'd come back to the \u201802 to '09 period as at least indicative of the way we view the line. Importantly, severity remains as expected, that's an important element so the actual inflation dynamic there is not an issue. And lastly, and again, this just speaks to the mechanics of the business, and I think the integrity of the process here, the delta, the change that we had assumed from the '10 into the '11 year, that turned out to be a good -- at least so far, remains a good assumption. The base of your [indiscernible] change some, but the delta into '11 that we had anticipated turned out to be, at least, so far consistent. So a tiny bit of a complicated story but you've got all the news.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a couple questions here. One thing you haven't talked about for a little while is the direct initiative. You mentioned and it looked like in the release about 80 basis points on a combined ratio, which something about $0.30 a share, if my math is right. Clearly, more significant than it was as a percentage of earnings when you launched it. Just kind of what do you look at in the development of that business to let you know that you're creating value and that you're hitting your objective so that it eventually starts to bring in earnings as opposed create that pressure? And just one follow-up.\nJay S. Fishman: I'll let Doreen and Greg answer as well, but I picked -- the one element that we continue to work on from an operational dynamic is we're getting pretty good at getting people through the quote process and getting quotes out. And our next step is to do better. Next step, we're working on more than anything else right now is to do better in converting those quotes into actual sales. And it's not immediately apparent to us that it's a function of price, although, it won't surprise any of you. If you listen to all the ads, the comment is those who switched saved whatever the number is, $400. No great shock. $400, no great shock if you quote someone $400 more than they're currently paid, the likelihood of switching is actually pretty low. So to comment, price is not an insignificant element there. We have a -- I don't know exactly what to call it, but we have a conversion curve. We know -- relative to at least what the customer discloses to us, their current prices is, we know how far, either plus or minus to that mark, we -- in a large number of accounts, how close we need to be to convert. But we've got more work to do in the conversion process so that the dollars that we're spending in the media -- and we're not spending nearly what anyone else and the big players, but to maximize that investment, just to get more of the quotes converted into sales. So that's our dynamic. Some of it is, we suspect, I'll say, reputational. I think there are other companies that have, as a result of doing this for years, found a reputation for being less expensive. Whether that's true or not is a whole other question, but they've seen to have earned a reputation for it. And we have to continue to build a reputation dynamic around the value proposition that we give. We're never going to be great at selling half a coverage sandwich, which $6. We're not comfortable selling half the sandwich for $3.10. That's just certainly not that who we are culturally. We're much more comfortable providing customers with the coverage they need rather than the dynamic of how much they can afford. That's just not us. So we're going to keep working at this and we got our fingers crossed, but we're well on our way.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then just a little bit more on workers comp. Just the premium line was pretty bumpy during the year. I'm just curious. Is that a result of pure seasonality? Is that a result of maybe some change in the competitive dynamic or just the market itself or any strategic change on your end?\nBrian W. MacLean: It's actually more just pricing and audit premium running through the numbers. So a decent piece of that is movement of the underlying exposure of the accounts and what payrolls have been and how those have moved up. And especially when compared to a year ago when many comp accounts had some fairly significant return premium dynamic. So you're going from a return premium environment to an audit premium plus environment, and that's probably the biggest single driver of the movement in that line.\nJay S. Fishman: And from our perspective, it's a good thing.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Yes.\nBrian W. MacLean: Oh, yes, that's definitely true.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So it's not initially a policy count, it's more of a exposure per unit?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes.\nJay S. Fishman: Payrolls. The initial premium is based on an estimate. We're coming down the road. When the policy expires, we do an audit. If the actual payroll was less than had originally been disclosed to us, then we have a return on premium if the payroll turns out to be more than what it was originally disclosed to us, we have an additional billing during the sort of depths of that great recession we were in the return of premium arena as customers shed payrolls far more aggressively than they have anticipated they would. And now they reached the stage where they were flattening out. That brought the audit premium back to 0, and have been growing modestly. And so what we're seeing again is now a change into the build arena of audit premium.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I mean, any change in the competitive dynamic just over a year, just in the larger case market that you've noticed?\nWilliam E. Cunningham: This is Bill Cunningham. Nothing discernible. I mean, in a large national...\nJay S. Fishman: When you say large, let's make sure...\nWilliam E. Cunningham: You're talking large national accounts less responsive business?\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Like your commercial accounts business, not the small, not the Select or Select Express, not the small and the commercial but kind of the down-the-middle commercial accounts business.\nWilliam E. Cunningham: I would just say over the course of the last 12 months, some of the crack that you've described, and we have seen competitors pushing price and moving price in another direction in a number of states that we compete with them.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.\nJay S. Fishman: I'm sorry, let me -- before I could take that question, let me just -- because Bill used words that we understand here internally. I think what he was saying -- you should correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what you're saying is when you say cracks, what you're seeing is other competitors struggling with workers comp line and not an insignificant increase in rates by other competitors as well. We never deal with other competitors. We get anecdotal observations from agents. But that's what Bill is speaking about, that we're, particularly, in the states that have been more challenging from a loss trend environment where we see other -- we understand, again, trying to -- we never talk you never talk with other competitors about rates in any way but we see them reaching for rate as well in that environment. That's what our comment was.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay. Next question -- Josh Shanker, question, please.\nJoshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: During the Goldman Sachs Financial Service Conference Call, you dissuaded investors from taking a look at Schedule P. Obviously, now we're going to look at that. But maybe you know more than we do, and if you can walk the math on why our look Schedule P would lead us to the wrong answers, and maybe if you can talk about what your reserve are going to look like when we do that following all of the 2011 numbers?\nJay S. Fishman: First, I don't think we ever dissuaded anybody from looking at the Schedule P. I just -- go back to that Goldman Sachs conference and we were talking about the complexity of making, I'll call it somewhat simplistic assumptions based upon kind of overall views. But our Schedule P is going to reveal the things that Brian shared with you earlier. You're going to see the 2010 accident year for workers comp had more claim frequency than we originally anticipated. You're going to see, in the auto liability line, particularly, I guess not particularly, but commercial auto for sure is going to see 10, 9 and -- 9 and 10?\nBrian W. MacLean: A tiny bit in 8 but mostly 9 and 10.\nJay S. Fishman: 9 and 10. And I think those are going to be the things that you'll see that -- and that's why we're providing the explanation here today, so that people understand what it is they'll be looking at when they see it.\nJoshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And then so far from what you're seeing, looking at the beginning of the year of 2011 to where you are today, those things you're seeing in 2010 have sort of reverted to the mean are not showing up this year?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, we booked the change into 2011, first of all. In other words, the base year, what we do, we develop loss estimates for a given year. We started out with the immediate preceding year. We'll make adjustments for frequency and severity that we anticipate. So when 2010 had that $94 million after-tax increase in claim activity that I spoke about, we obviously rolled that forward into our 2011 loss estimate, and that's been booked and recorded. As we look to 2012, we obviously are starting out with the base, again. But now you're asking the complicated question, of that $94 million in that year, how much is a timing difference that we see just from one year to the next, and how much is permanent difference? But we certainly are going into 2012 eyes wide open with respect to the 2010 accident year and what its effect was. That gets me back to my comment earlier that the estimated return on allocated capital for comp broadly speaking. I mean, before [ph] across the whole book is at the moment in the low double-digit range, so it's -- and that's incorporating that 2010 development into that.\nJay S. Benet: And if I could add a couple of things. I mean, there's a story line that you have to follow in our Q's where we're describing things that are taking place each quarter, some of which, as Jay said, impact us as we look at the business going forward. And that's when we talk about base year movement and our adjustments for current year loss picks and ultimate results for a particular year. There are other things that take place that get reflected in Schedule P that don't impact the numbers going forward. So if you look at some of the property line, as an example, what you'll see is disclosure in our 10-Qs talking about some development that's taking place, one that comes to mind were the Arizona hail storms that impacted us from 2010 where we made loss estimates associated with what we have been seeing. And then in 2011, saw a further development on those losses that get reflected in our property lines. Those are losses that are episodic, and therefore, don't impact us when it comes to looking at loss fix. So we say it's complicated, those are the kind of things that we're talking about. The granularity of information that we go through to make a determination, number one, are our reserves fairly stated at the end of the quarter which are at always best estimate. And then two, what do this information tells us about the past as well as the future and then trying to very granularly and thoughtfully build those into our ongoing analysis.\nJay S. Fishman: The important point I think we made the important point on the Goldman Sachs Day was that there seems to be a view somehow that current year reserve adequacy is a function of late. And that concept is just foreign to us. We don't understand it actually. We make estimates of losses and we make those estimates of losses, frequency, severity, and so the notion that we would not be making our best estimate because a couple of years ago, rate was more challenged relative to 5 years ago when it was less challenged. It was just completely foreign to us. We don't get that. So to us, at least, and I'm speaking just for Travelers, the way we establish loss reserves are independent of whatever the rate is, that's being very granularly determined and they are constantly being reviewed by actuaries internally. And you've heard us say, when we make re-adjustments to current year loss picks, current year loss picks, not prior year, it's because we're seeing activity either up or down that was different from what we had originally expected that loss activity to be, so that was the comment. By all means, dig into Scheduled P.\nJoshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I appreciate, and thank you, very granular answers. Just a quick numbers question. Brian went through the math on personal auto. What is the run rate for this U.S. thing for annual cats per year in the loss ratio, normalized?\nJay S. Fishman: In auto?\nJoshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: You said you were targeting 96. You got to 98.5, but that doesn't include any normalized cats. So I just want to also get that part. I think, at least, maybe a bit.\nJay S. Fishman: No. That -- go ahead answer the question.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, Josh. It leads us [indiscernible] really insignificant for the auto side and put this in normal expectation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A couple of questions. One, just to start clarifying. Your 99.5 to 98.5 run rate, was that Personal Auto Or Personal Insurance?\nBrian W. MacLean: That was Personal Auto and the delta is the 1 point of pretty clearly identifiable weather-related activity above that pretty low normal activity.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, that's fair. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right. And then within FTI, obviously, you've been exiting the personal lines of business in Ireland. You talked about that from a premium standpoint. Just curious whether or not that exit is having any positive impact on the loss ratio, and if so, how much.\nBrian W. MacLean: I don't know the exact number. It should have a positive impact, but it will be pretty small.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. And then just kind of timing wise, how far are we -- I mean, my sense is there might be one more quarter of kind of cycling through. Is that right in terms of timing?\nBrian W. MacLean: Maybe 2, but I think the overall personal lines of premium in 2011 was about $24 million, $25 million. It's pretty small and should tell us in the next couple of quarters.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then, I guess, a bigger question, how customers are adapting to the rate increases? Obviously, we know exposures are up on an underlying basis with the economy. Which puts some purchase -- price pressure, at least dollar spend pressure, on customers who are raising rates on top of that. Are you seeing customers either change the limits they're buying? And I recognize not all your customers may have the flexibility to do so, but are you seeing any change in buying behavior? Either limits, deductibles or other things, clients are dealing to try to mitigate kind of the dollar impact on them?\nWilliam E. Cunningham: This is Bill Cunningham. I would say, we're not seeing any meaningful change in the commercial space on terms of conditions either limits or deductibles. Where we are seeing changes in deductibles would be on the larger property end in wind exposed areas, and that would on the margin, but I would say across the board, clients are opting more for the price increase than a deductible increase. But again, that's largely anecdotal. But the numbers would support that it's more about the price and less about the terms and condition.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Then can you just help, on a written basis, connect the dots between what you reported for rate increases, exposure increases in Business Insurance relative to what we're actually seeing show up on the net line in terms of written premium increases? I mean, I get retentions down, but it doesn't seem to be down relative to the positive push from those 2 things to explain kind of the delta.\nWilliam E. Cunningham: It's a retention and I would say new business dynamic, the new business being off of it.\nBrian W. MacLean: I'm not sure I got the question there, Matt. I'm sorry.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, based on your chart, it looks like you're saying Business Insurance pricing are up 6%. It looks like based on your chart, you're showing exposure growth of somewhere between 2% and 4%, which would make the range 8% to 10%. Retention's down 4%, so that takes that to 4% to 6%. And I get new business is down a little bit but that feels more like 100 bps, so I would net-net expected better growth.\nBrian W. MacLean: Okay. So you got audit premium spread. Why don't you...\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That was a positive delta year-on-year too, though.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. Right. So if you're trying to reconcile written premium year-over-year, you've got the rate as a big improvement on a full year basis about 5 points. You got 2.5 points of exposure. You got retention down 5 points plus you've also got new retention business, a change in new business.\nJay S. Fishman: The biggest driver offsetting the price gains is retention in new business the quarter.\nBrian W. MacLean: And then you've got audit premium swinging from negative to positives.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Maybe I'll follow up offline because I'm not exactly following.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: I appreciate all the colors and disclosure on the reserve issues both in change. And you really substantial disclosures in your third quarter stat filings, which, I think, are better than a lot of your peers. The one question I'd have basically the follow-up on Josh's conversation and all the sort of talking we've done about workers' comp and commercial and personal auto and the challenges there. Recent past couple of quarters have seen a lot of releases from surety, as well as I think disclosures on your third quarter regulatory filings suggests that the asset funds and the liability, so claims made in occurrence, are funding much of the recent reserve favorable development, as well as -- it potentially sound like you're maybe a UA [ph] reclassification. And I think we use the word episodic before, I'm curious, should investors be looking at these as the sorts of things that we should be plugging into our models for next year as favorable offsets to potentially sort of modest favorable development and going forward in the other lines where we're talking about potential challenges?\nJay S. Fishman: This is Jay Benet. We've answered this question a number of times in the past. We, as a management team, have this very, very robust processes each quarter to evaluate, what our reserve changes look like, and to come up with our best estimate of reserves. We have no guidance. We have no views that we would have either internally or to share externally as to how reserves are going to develop. So I think, you, as an analyst, can feel free to think of whatever patterns you've seen, whatever you're hearing from other companies. As Jay said, it's all dependent upon what a company's assumptions are, what the starting point is, what are the loss ratios that they have at this point in time and how things are going to develop. So one company's development can look a lot different than in other companies. But I think you see our history, you see what we've done in terms of putting up reserves in the past, how those reserves have developed. And as I said, our view is we're always at best estimate and you can come up with whatever you view you think is appropriate.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Yes, that's certainly fair and expected, something like that. Just in the context of sureties, obviously, sort of an episodic, credit-related reserve and then the commentary you guys had suggested around the excess coverage, which is related to favorable traditional environment over the past number of years. And we're just wondering if we should look at this as kind of a onetime thing and maybe you've already answer that so...\nJay S. Benet: We're always building in the current view as to how an environment has changed. So if we have certain views of the toward environment, let's say, several years ago that we're driving a certain level of reserves and that sort of environment has improved to date, we'd look at, okay, where is it today and we have some view as to where we think it might go in the future and that would be the basis upon which we reserve. But what we don't do is we don't say, gee there some continuum of improvement. Let's book 1/4 of it now, we'll book a quarter next quarter, and we'll keep -- and keep going. It's always based on facts and circumstances as they exist and it's the best estimate at that point in time.\nJay S. Benet: And if you go back in time in our disclosures, what you'll see is the description of what's generating positive development, it's changed. It's been this line or the other line or that year in property or liability, or just -- it's a very big business. We're making estimates for multi-billions of dollars of losses every given year and things just workout somewhat differently than we had originally expected. But it's not as if there is a pattern there that somehow is reliable. It's just changed over the years and different line show up at different times. If we had -- as we said at the Goldman Sachs Day, our goal is to get it right. It's not to -- I know it feels good when you have that favorable reserve development in the period that it's reported, but we're pricing product every day. And if we're going to make the most of what we got, either growing our business or recognizing lost trend or adjusting, the only way we're going to make really thoughtful decisions, really good ones, is if we get it right. So that's our goal. Our goal is to get it right. It's obviously better than -- everybody says favorable, better than unfavorable. But -- and maybe that's true at the moment, but when we have favorable development, that means that we over-costed our product in the year in which -- from the year it relates to, and maybe we could have sold more if we had a different view of costs. So we're very driven to try and get it right.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Yes, I think that's right. I personally grew up in business always thinking that the right answer is the right answer, and if they could lead you to better decisions, I think you guys, obviously, sort of do a good job of explaining, but we shouldn't count on these things going forward. And so I don't think there's any issues there. If I could just ask one final numbers question.\nGabriella Nawi: We'd like to move on to the next question. Thanks. We kind of gave you your tip.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant with KBW.\nCliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Just on the investment portfolio. Do you anticipate any changes in strategy? And can you comment on the outlook for the non-fixed income portion of the portfolio, please?\nJay S. Benet: Well, no changes in strategy. We have a strategy, which we think accommodates a very wide range of conditions. In terms of the outlook for the portfolio, am I allowed to give an outlook?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, we sort of did. Someone else had asked, about the non-fixed income...\nJay S. Benet: Well, that was what we expected on an ongoing basis. I think I'm being asked for an outlook for the quarter. So the question is -- I guess, typically, we don't an outlook for the quarter.\nGabriella Nawi: That was it?\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay. Well, thank you for joining the call. We appreciate the time given that we went a bit over. But if you have any further questions, please contact myself or Andrew Hersom in the IR department. Thanks, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Wednesday, October 19, 2011. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Sussie. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investor section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation, and then we will open it for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay S. Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. You, of course, all know that this was another quarter marked by significant weather. In that context, our business is strong enough to have produced $332 million in operating income and an operating return on equity of 5.9%. For the full year, we're at $781 million of operating income and an operating return on equity of 4.5%. While this year has certainly placed considerable demands on our claim department, we're very pleased that our claim teams were prepared and positioned to customers with first-rate speed. I also couldn't be more pleased with our catastrophe claim management strategy upon which we embarked in 2005. Our ability to respond to claimants with almost entirely internal staffs sets us apart from many other insurance companies and allows us to process claims more effectively and efficiently, as well as with a higher level of customer satisfaction.  Turning to our operations, our strategy is quite focused. We are seeking improved pricing, as well as improved terms and conditions on the insurance products we sell. We are doing so not only because interest rates may remain low for some time, but also given the possibility that the more active weather patterns, such as we have experienced over the last few years, may continue. And the progress we are making pursuing the strategy is already evident in our Business Insurance segment. In the quarter, we achieved pricing gains across all product lines, led by workers compensation and property. The overall pure renewal rate gain in the quarter for Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, was just over 3% and just over 4% for the month of September, demonstrating our success in driving rate improvement. And while we are prepared to trade volume for improve margins and profitability, retention remains at strong levels and forms a basis for our optimism that we can continue to improve pricing in our Business Insurance segment. In that regard, we are particularly pleased with our results in our middle market businesses, and Brian will have more to say about that later. We also note that exposure in our Business Insurance segment remains positive and continues to improve. In addition, audit premiums have also turned meaningfully positive. The combination of higher exposure in auto premiums, as well as improved rate are important factors, which allowed us to generate a significant 7% growth in net written premiums in Business Insurance this quarter. While our strategy is the same in Personal Insurance, our renewal premium change for property has been in the 8% to 9% range for some time, and our renewal premium change for auto has been in the 3% to 4% range. And the regulatory environment is such that it will take some time before our more recent actions will show in our results. With respect to capital management, we repurchased $375 million of stock in the quarter, and our guidance with respect to targeted fourth quarter repurchases is considerably higher. Jay Benet will share that with you during his comments. Finally, we're also pleased that Standard & Poor's upgraded our financial strength ratings to AA, although we are not reliant on the commercial paper market to fund our operations, our short-term ratings are now A1/P1. In summary, the weather was again challenging, but we remain bullish on our ability to deliver rate improvements and superior returns over time. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks, Jay. There are a few things I'd like to discuss with you this morning, so let me start with the weather. Third quarter catastrophe losses, which were driven by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee, with $394 million after-tax, much higher than what we were consider \"normal\" and more than 5x our cap losses in last year's third quarter. Losses related to Hurricane Irene were $253 million after-tax. It represented only 1% of shareholders' equity. The losses from Tropical Storm Lee was $74 million after tax. The cats were not the only weather story in the quarter. As Brian will discuss later, both Business Insurance and Personal Insurance experienced significantly higher levels of non-cat weather-related losses that, when combined with the expected impact of earned pricing and loss cost trends, drove a 4.5 point quarter-over-quarter increase in our consolidated GAAP combined ratio, ex-cats and prior-year development. Turning to reserves, third quarter's total net favorable prior-year reserve development was $124 million after tax, down a bit from $147 million after tax in the prior-year quarter. Once again, all 3 of our business segments experienced net favorable prior-year reserve development as a result of better than expected loss experience. Within Business Insurance, reserve development included a $114 million after-tax increase to our asbestos reserves. While the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged, recent payment trends have been moderately higher than we had previously anticipated. I'd also point out that this year's asbestos reserve increase was actually less than last year's increase on a gross basis. You will recall that last year, the asbestos reserve increase was net of a reduction in the uncollectible reinsurance reserve of $70 million or $45 million after tax, that resulted from a favorable ruling related to a reinsurance dispute. Page 7 of the webcast summarizes our holdings of sovereign debt securities issued by Eurozone countries that are considered troubled: Spain, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Portugal, amounting to only $8 million as of the end of the quarter. The schedule also shows our holdings of all securities issued by banks, insurance companies, finance and leasing companies and brokers and asset managers in these troubled countries, consisting of debt and nonredeemable preferred stock. These holdings amounted to only $16 million as of the end of the quarter. Lastly, the schedule shows our holdings of securities issued by other Eurozone financial institutions where the securities are not guaranteed by the sovereign country. In total, all of these Eurozone holdings represent only a tiny fraction of our $73.7 billion investment portfolio. While our analysis of the RMS version 11 hurricane model update remains a work in process, we do have some preliminary observations we would like to share with you this morning, all of course, subject to the completion of our works. Based upon our evaluation of RMS 11 and other hurricane models that we use in combination with our own expensive data, we currently believe that we will be increasing our expected hurricane average annual loss, or AAL, as well as our expected hurricane probable maximum loss, or PML. This is one of the reasons that our strategy is focused on pricing and terms and conditions. Notwithstanding these expected increases on our hurricane AAL and PML, we currently expect our total catastrophe exposure adjusted for RMS 11 will remain within our targeted equity impact range as contemplated by our existing capital structure and that, as a result, we are not expecting to increase our target capital levels, significantly reduce our exposures, or purchase additional reinsurance as a result of RMS 11. I'll remind you, this analysis is still a work in progress so these observations are preliminary. Lastly, let me mention a few key numbers. Operating cash flow was very strong this quarter at $917 million, despite the large spike in claim costs due to weather. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity in U.S. dollars that are in the United States and therefore, not subject to tax on repatriation of $2.4 billion. Net unrealized investment gains increased to $4 billion pre-tax or $2.6 billion after tax, and book value per share rose to $60.98 at the end of the quarter, a 4% increase since the beginning of the year. And consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $375 million of common stock and paid $173 million in dividends, bringing year-to-date common stock repurchases to $1.7 billion and year-to-date dividends of $503 million. Based upon our current liquidity position and our expectations for fourth quarter operating income, which as always, does not include any provision for reserve development and subject to other needs that may arise, such as contribution to our qualified pension plan, which we currently do not expect to have to make. We are targeting fourth quarter common stock repurchases at approximately $1 billion. And with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. As we just mentioned, our third quarter earnings were meaningfully impacted by the catastrophic weather events listed on Slide 4 of the webcast, as well as an above-average amount of non-catastrophic weather. Excluding the impact of weather and prior year development, we continue to see margins that were essentially in line with our expectations. The other important part of our story this quarter was the strong increases in pricing that we continued to achieve broadly across our businesses. This is especially true in Business Insurance, where net written premiums were up 7% year-over-year, driven by double-digit increases in our Commercial Accounts and industry-focused businesses. The overall increase in net written premiums included renewal premium change of 5%, of which pure rate accounted for over 3%. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive rate increases in Business Insurance and in fact, these are the largest rate gain since the Travelers-St. Paul merger in 2004. In addition, we are achieving the rate gains broadly with increases in all product lines for the second consecutive quarter. The workers compensation line had the highest level of rate increase, and the property lines showed the most significant improvement over last quarter. As you can see on Slide 14, the pace of rate increases, both in Commercial Accounts and in the segment as a whole, continued to accelerate as we ended the third quarter, with segment rate at 4% and Commercial Accounts at 6% for the month of September. Importantly, we believe that these written rate levels exceed our current view of lost trend. I know this is only one month, but after speaking to you about margin compression for the last several years, we believe this is significant. And based on our preliminary view, we believe we are making further progress in October. In addition to the rate gains, our top line benefited from our customers purchasing more insurance. Exposure was up about 2% this quarter, and audit premiums were up meaningfully, both year-over-year and in sequential quarters. Retention remains solid, while new business is down slightly from the same period last year. Along with our renewal pricing strategy, we are also achieving better pricing on our new business. And although this may have an impact on new business volume going forward, we are comfortable with that trade-off. Turning to third quarter operating earnings. In addition to the significantly higher catastrophe losses and less favorable prior-year development versus the third quarter of 2010, results have been negatively impacted by some non-recurring items, primarily the non-catastrophe weather largely in the property lines. Last quarter, we provided you with an update on our workers compensation loss trends, specifically noting a modest uptick in frequency. Through this quarter, overall loss trend has remained stable, and frequency is performing as we expected. As always, we continue to manage this line closely on a state-by-state basis. So we continue to feel good about the underlying performance of this business and are extremely pleased with the rate gains that we've achieved and in particular, the pricing momentum that occurred in the latter part of the quarter.  In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, operating income of $211 million was strong and consistent with strong operating income in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter's underwriting gain was up modestly due to favorable prior-year development. The 3.2 points of deterioration in the adjusted combined ratio is due to the impact of lower levels of earned premium and unusually low level of what we define as large losses in the prior-year quarter and an increase in infrastructure investment to support growth in the International business. For the first time since the first quarter of 2009, our management liability business and Bond & Financial Products experienced growth on a production basis. And excluding the impact of a personal lines distribution arrangement in Ireland that we terminated last year, the International business also grew on a production basis for the first time since the first quarter of 2010. In both cases, this is the continuation of a positive trend going back several quarters, and we believe is the result of IT investments and other strategic efforts. Surety volume continues to be down, reflecting sluggishness in construction spending and underwriting selection.  Moving to Personal Insurance, extraordinary weather events, both catastrophic and non-catastrophic, continue to adversely impact our financials and drove an operating loss for the quarter. Net favorable prior-year development for the segment was somewhat less than the third quarter of 2010. Excluding cats and prior-year development, the Personal Insurance combined ratio increased approximately 3 points quarter-over-quarter in both Homeowners, as well as Auto. The majority of this increase was driven by adverse non-cat weather. Certainly, we're not going to try and predict the weather, but by incorporating the last 2 years of actual experience into our long-term averages, our expectation of weather losses in this business has increased. In response, we will be driving for additional rate increases, as well as adjusting terms and conditions and looking for higher deductibles. Turning to the production results, both lines of business posted year-over-year growth in policies in force this quarter, while net written premiums were up 3% in Agency Homeowner and down slightly for Agency Auto. Renewal premium change and retention were strong in both Auto and Home, while new business volume was down from the same period last year. We expect new business volumes may decline modestly going forward, as we continue a disciplined execution on our pricing strategy. As in Business Insurance, this is a trade-off that we are comfortable making. Now before we go to Q&A, I'll turn it back to Jay Fishman for a comment.\nJay S. Fishman: Thank you, Brian. I just want to take 15 seconds to acknowledge an important anniversary, our much appreciated and much loved partner, Bill Heyman, is celebrating his 20th anniversary with the company. And consistent with Travelers' expense-minded culture, I'm handing him his inexpensive and cheap Lucite plaque. No watches here, but I can't think of a better place to acknowledge 20 years, Bill, than in front of the people for whom you've been working all this time and doing such a terrific job. Congratulations.\nWilliam H. Heyman: I have no idea. Thank you.\nJay S. Fishman: With that, operator, we're going to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question, coming from the line of Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just a question on workers comp. Obviously, you saw some -- a lot of premium growth in the quarter that's been a trend this year. Can you talk a little bit about pricing versus loss trend there? And kind of what is the geographic breakdown of that business and any problem states, or states where you're seeing loss trend increase in what you're doing there?\nBrian W. MacLean: Mike, this is Brian. I'll take a shot at some high level comments, and then throw it to Bill Cunningham and I'll probably preface all of this with were not going to get to granularity into talking about a specific state or market. As we said in the comments, we feel comp pricing has been moving. It started moving before the other lines of business. And we continue to see some decent increases there. So we feel good about where we are pricing versus loss trend broadly in that business. We spent a good bit of time on last quarter's call talking about what was in the end of the day, a pretty little movement in frequency, but we wanted to break it out. So the loss trend continues to move as we discussed then.\nJay S. Fishman: Which importantly, just to interrupt, if you remember the conversation last quarter, it was that we were moving back to the previously anticipated trend line just a little bit faster than we had expected. So that trend line remains intact, So there's no subsequent issue or problem or change with respect to the workers comp loss relative to our conversation last quarter.\nBrian W. MacLean: So important, when you look at just premium change, though, and this is true of comp and all of the commercial businesses, what's really driving it is 3 things: The rate component, and really, in this order: Rate, audit premium and exposure growth. And so it's not like we're adding a ton of market share here. We're looking at moving pricing and getting better pricing for the risks we're taking. The other thing I'll say and then throw it to Bill is not only is it a state-by-state, but it's business-by-business. So we have a kind of a different view of small comp versus middle market comp versus large comp. We're always trying to balance all of those.\nWilliam E. Cunningham: And just a few things to add. First, and I don't know if mentioned payrolls, payrolls are up.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, which is what's driving the exposure in the Auto premium.\nWilliam E. Cunningham: Right, and I guess, again, not getting into specific geographies, for competitive reasons, what I will tell you is that there are wide ranges of rate change that we're gaining, and it depends on our view of a given state. So the overall rate gain for the line continues to move in more dramatically in the states where we need it. And we see a loss trend dynamic. As we said last quarter, we reflected in our pricing, in our reserving that uptick. And as we look at loss trend and rate gain, we talk about being in front of loss trend projections comp based on our pricing today. And I think we were there sooner on that line and the gap between rate and lost from that line is actually wider than the all lines average.\nJay S. Fishman: And just to clarify my comments to make sure we don't confuse anybody. In the second quarter, we increased -- lost pick for workers comp overall to reflect that acceleration into the trend line. That loss estimate is the same one we used for the third quarter, mix adjusted and everything else. But we didn't go back. It currently is at the level that we reestablished it in the second quarter.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And then just on the Travelers Select, I mean, obviously, commercial line is up a lot. I mean, is that a reflection of pushing your systems into larger policy sizes, whether it's Select or Select Express? I was just curious to see a big lift in commercial line, and I imagine a lot of that is comp. But the Select was flat. Is that a result of maybe to Brian's comment that pricing is up higher maybe than others?\nBrian W. MacLean: I apologize, Mike. I'm not getting the question of that was that I know of.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Well, it's just that Select as a platform and new business was flat, or premiums were flat whereas commercial lines were higher.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, okay. The basic dynamic that's going on there as we've talked about in Select, Select Express is the smaller end. What we call Plus is the larger end. The Plus market, the larger account market is in aggregate down for us and one that we're pushing harder in from a pricing perspective. So that's what would be fundamentally driving that.\nJay S. Fishman: The returns, if one breaks Select in 2, it's 2 pieces, Select Express, the lower end Select Plus, the upper end. The returns in the Select Plus business have not been at levels that we feel comfortable just sitting on. And that's partially because we're competing in that segment with smaller, more regional companies who view the upper end of Select as their middle market. So it tends to be a segment of the business that attracts a fair amount of competition. The pricing dynamics there had been a little more difficult, relative to a lower end, more difficult. And so we set our standards and whatever happens to the volume happens. And if we shrink, we shrink; and if we're flat, we're flat, it's okay, as long as the business that we're pricing is being priced at a level that we're prepared to take on and live with. Is that fair?\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My first question is more broad. It has to do with the P&C cycle. Jay Fishman, are you calling for a broad cycle turn here? I mean, you're talking about price increases in Business Insurance in particular, now in excess of loss cost and positive territory for 3 quarters in a row. Is that what you're calling for here?\nJay S. Fishman: No, sir. In fact, if you go through the comments here today, you won't actually hear the words market or market cycle in anybody's commentary. We decided a year ago -- as I've said, and you've heard us speak about this in other meetings and in our investor days. We're much more skeptical that the amplitude of the cyclicality that many of us grew up in, in this business remains. For a whole host of substances systemic reasons, we just don't think it exists in the same way anymore. And we made the decision a year ago, if you recall, that regardless of whether a red light went on somewhere that was going to declare a cycle turn that we were going to attempt to take our destiny in our own hands and move our own pricing. And whatever happened would happen. We were very encouraged as following the second quarter last year, the results were moving in very much the right direction. We were never nearly as negative as the surveys would've suggested. We shared that data with you. But we made progress. And went from, broadly speaking, negative to positive. Following the weather this year, we decided after the second quarter to further accelerate our own efforts. And so I'm not viewing what anybody else is doing. I'm not declaring any change or turn, absolutely not. I'm just telling you what we're doing. This is active, not passive. We're not reacting to the marketplace. We're just deciding for ourselves what we're going to do in the way we're going to price the product. And we'll see what happens.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: That makes sense. And then for Jay Benet, 2 other ones. First, looking in the 10-Q in terms of the pace of the buyback for 2012, it says Travelers does not expect that we'll continue to repurchase shares in excess of its operating income in 2012. So does that mean it could potentially be less than the operating income that's generated next year? And second, why the shift, especially given $1 billion share buyback pace potentially in 4Q?\nJay S. Benet: As you've heard us say before, we've been generating excess capital, we've been returning the capital to our shareholders. We had built up excess capital. We've been operating, as I mentioned during the Barclays conference, in ways to free up capital on the balance sheet, either through reinsurance collections or changes in reserves that have taken place over time or looking at other things. So I mean, eventually, you get to the point where you return the excess capital to your shareholders, and then what you're doing through your operating earnings is creating more capital, evaluating how much of that capital that you're creating through earnings you need to run the business and then from that returning the excess, if you will, to your shareholders, either through dividends or through buyback. So we think we're getting close to that inflection point where the excess is actually being or will have been returned, and we'll be dealing with the creation of new excess through the earnings.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then, Jay, last one. The impact of DAC accounting changes in 2012, any potential write-down for Travelers?\nJay S. Benet: Actually, I think if you look at the new rules closely, you'll see that the new rules really paralleled what we've been doing, so there's not going to be any impact from those new rules for us.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: So big impact for the life companies but not for PNC or Travelers.\nJay S. Benet: Certainly not for us. I mean, our DAC policy has been to DAC commissions and premium taxes essentially and nothing else. So that coincides with the rules.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.\nJoshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: In responding to Jay's question, you said that by the year ago, you decided to take destiny into your own hands and you've seeing favorable results. You're talking about 3 consecutive quarters here of improving renewal rate trend. But also over that same period of time, I'm seeing on running margins deteriorate and it's accelerated. Excluding cats and reserve development, this insurance ratios were up 4 quarters go 100 basis points, 200 basis points, 300 basis points, and then this quarter, it's up year-over-year 700 basis points. I'm seeing a disconnect there. I realize one is earned premium and one is written premium. But it's been going on for a little while here. Can you sort of walk me through what's going on here?\nJay S. Benet: Sure. Well, first, your first point is exactly correct. There's an enormous difference between earned and written. And the rate gains reflect themselves in written premiums and obviously will be earned, respectively. The comment in the press release that we issued this morning was important relative to in Brian's comments as well. The fact that we were now at a point where if, in fact, these written rate gains continue, that they exceed our current view of loss trend. So that's the first, written versus earned.\nJoshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Well, let me just say, a year ago, you said rates were flat and now we have 700 basis points of deterioration from stuff you wrote a year ago. Is that a wrong way to...\nJay S. Benet: The numbers are public. My recollection is that overall rate in the second quarter of last year was still actually modestly negative. Loss trend obviously was positive, and we shared with all of you, you included, that we were anticipating margin compression. We were very clear, very transparent at the end of last year and into this year that we were anticipating, projecting and shared with you, in fact, even we were giving guidance the magnitude of the margin compression that we were expecting. And that was driven by the fact that underlying loss trend was running at a higher rate than the -- and at that point, the negative rate that we were achieving. It wasn't substantially negative, but negative is nonetheless negative. And we made progress in moving that price, moving the rate up, but it wasn't -- it isn't until just recently, it wasn't until just recently that the numbers are such that the written rate gains now are projected to exceed current view of loss trend. We've never said that before. You can go back to all the transcripts and you can check. When asked, the closest I think we ever got was that we were saying it was getting close to a push. That was about as close as we got to talking about changing margins. And the last piece, and particularly in this quarter, the most important is non-cat weather. It plays a substantive role in our quarter-to-quarter margins and in our estimates of combined ratios. What I can share with you is this. When you look at the underlying combined ratio now for every business segment that we are, and I'm saying this exclusive of whatever catastrophe load each of us would think is appropriate, but every single one of those segments for the 9 months, for the year-to-date, has a run rate combined ratio of under 100%, some a little more, then some others a little less. But I think that what we've been sharing with everyone about what we were expecting in rate gains and loss trend is the most transparent in the business. And I don't quite see the disconnect. I think we've been very clear about where rate gains and loss trends have been moving.\nJoshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: Can you give a little detail on you said non-cat weather. How much were the percent of the combined ratio do you think non-cat weather has been running over the past few quarters compared to where it used to be?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, Josh, so this is Brian. I'd stepped from -- because you can pick a part that combined ratios by quarter and look at a whole bunch of different things. But if you look at our year-to-date in Business Insurance combined ratio and the ex-cat, ex-PYD number of 98.2, I would say knock about a point off of that and you've got what we view as our run rate combined. Round number, which is roughly a 2-point deterioration, as you can see on the page. It's 2.9, so knock a point off of that, it's about a 2-point deterioration in the margin. That's -- anytime you look at the quarter, you've got weather spikes, you've got weather compared to what weather was last year, if a quarter was made -- an adjustment was made in this quarter or an adjustment was made in prior-year quarter and then we put so 3 quarters worth of the impact in one spot, the numbers get wacky.\nJay S. Fishman: And in a given quarter, there'll be an episodic large loss that's not really run rate driven. Our best analysis, as Brian says, is looking at the reported ex-cat of 98.2 and we see about a point in there that's driven by what we would certainly consider non-run rate items.\nBrian W. MacLean: Right. And back to about 2 points of margin compression for the year.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Keith Walsh with Citi.\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: First question, you mentioned on previous calls that the delta between new business pricing and renewals are shrinking. I just wanted to know, is that still the case? If can update us on that. And the reason I really asked this is broker Brown & Brown yesterday made some comments that would maybe contrast with that statement a little bit, and then I've got a follow-up.\nBrian W. MacLean: No, our experience is that it is continuing to shrink a little bit.\nJay S. Fishman: And we would, as a matter of -- I don't have a number to give you on this. But as we've been speaking with our field people, a very relevant question is okay. We get what you're doing in the renewal rate arena, but what are you doing in the new business arena? What we're instructing our field people to do is to bring that higher level of expected rate to their new business negotiations. That's very, very important. It's the instructions that they're getting or to be as return focused in new. It doesn't mean the returns are equivalent but to be as a return focused in new as they are in renewal. And to the extent that new business falls off, that's just fine. No issue there. Do you want to add any? No? And anything in Personal or FPII that you want to add or...\nWilliam E. Cunningham: I don't think it's much of the dynamic in [indiscernible]\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, because you're all the same. You have the same pricing. It's a Business Insurance phenomenon.\nBrian W. MacLean: What we know factually, Keith, is our experience, the target that we're putting out and what we believe the prices that we're writing in at is the GAAP is narrowing some for us. Whether it's unique, we don't know.\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, great. And then for Jay, you guys have done a nice job achieving and articulating the progress on rate the last several quarters. But just more big picture. How do you link a needed rate increases with the current yield realities? And then more specifically, is the rate you're getting today commensurate with the drop in net investment income you're experiencing now and going forward?\nJay S. Fishman: Those are great questions. They really are. And something that we spend a tremendous amount of time here analyzing and looking at. So first is, as I've shared with all of you before, we do have a quarterly analysis that looks at renewal, return on allocated capital, as well as new business return on allocated capital for every product that we sell in every business. And it's a policy view. What I mean by it, it's literally the term we use internally. It's an analysis which attempts to say given everything we know today, rate today, loss trend today, what is the return on that product. About -- I got to check specifically, but maybe 9 months ago, we determined to update that analysis for the new yield curve in such a way that the analysis now calculates these returns as if all the new money is going in against the yield curve as it's currently structured. Now the last time we -- meaning, all the premium money. The capital bears a percentage of the return embedded in the portfolio but the new money goes in against the old curve, and we just count it back. We have not yet updated it for what I would say are the events over the last 6 weeks because the yield curve is most certainly flattening again. And I don't know how long it will stay but once we become convinced that that's longer rather than shorter, we will update it for that. The returns are not -- I'm not going to share with you what they are, but when we know them. We know them and we understand the impact both of the declining investment environment, as well as the impact in our property lines of weather. And obviously, the long tail lines are more impacted by the investment environment. The shorter tailed lines are more impacted by the weather. But no matter how you look at it, they were all impacted. That gets us to driving for rate. Because while I believe, and I do believe this, I believe that our accident year return on equity overall in a normal weather year, whatever that means, is still in excess of our cost of equity. And I believe that it is. We still need to begin to drive rate because the portfolio will continue to mature and roll over into the lower yields. And we've got to make sure that we always have in mind delivering superior returns relative to our cost of equity. So we're on it. And that's why the urgency here for, as a matter of tactics, I would say, it is now all about rate. It is all about rate.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Wanted to just follow up on a couple of items that obviously we've been discussing. One is just on the potential for margin inflection. I just want to be clear. Has your margin already inflected? I mean, effectively, what you're saying is in September and October, pricing is outstripping loss? And so what I'm trying to assess is margins on an accident year ex-cat, ex-reserve basis, core margins have been deteriorating for several years now. Should we begin to inflect them into next year in our models?\nBrian W. MacLean: So the first important thing and we try to say it, but let's emphasize it. We're talking about written rate. So the 4.3 points of rate that we're seeing in September in Business Insurance, we believe is ahead of our current view of loss trend. That needs to earn into the income statement over time. And so to the extent that we can string a reasonable number of months together like that, it will begin to earn in. But that earns in the way premium earns in. So it's 1/12 at a time. And so we are not saying that in September, the month in our income statement, we saw margin expansion. Just to be crystal clear.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes, and I'm more thinking about next year. So are there any businesses right now where margins are -- where pricing is below loss trend?\nBrian W. MacLean: Right now, in all of our segments...\nJay S. Fishman: On an earned basis, let's make sure we're answering the right question.\nBrian W. MacLean: Okay, yes. On a written basis, we feel that in all of our segments, we are ahead of loss trend. Maybe modestly. Yes, assuming a normalized weather, if any of us know what normal weather is anymore. But...\nJay S. Fishman: But the realization of that, 2 things have to happen. We have to continue to deliver at least that level of rate and also, we have to keep monitoring loss trend to make sure that doesn't change because of inflation or any other element. But that -- not even back of the envelop which is said to me, when will this begin to evident itself, and it doesn't mean that in the aggregate, margins will at your face expand but, Brian, given the timing, by the time we get to the second quarter of next year, if this pattern continues at that point, and we should test that because I'm doing this really on the fly. But by the time we get to the second quarter, I would think that, in fact, the combined ratio would begin to shrink all other things being the same.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, that's very -- Brian, were you going to comment? Or that's very helpful. Okay, Great. And then actually just a question, again, you guys are very thoughtful on ROE and capital allocation. It's tied into your management compensation. So how are you -- it's very, very difficult unless we have a substantial margin improvement next year to get to an ROE into the double digits, well into the double digits. So how do you set goals for next year, given where yields are at, sort of building off to Keith's question earlier? But the combined ratio is only one lever. The other lever in investments is sort of is what it is, and it's out there.\nJay S. Fishman: No, that's -- it's, again, another thoughtful question, Greg. Two things. One is that from a GAAP perspective, meaning the earnings per share that we will report, the investment yield continues to take time. It rolls -- the portfolio rolls obviously, but it doesn't happen all at once. So from a pure GAAP reported perspective, it's not as bad as if one did the analysis, assuming the entire portfolio were currently invested at current yields. So we have 2 separate analysis to do. What drives our pricing is pure economics. What current rates are available to invest new premium dollars that we bring in. We don't kid ourselves one bit. We understand and fundamentally discount back at today's yields in the aggregate. And we haven't done our budget yet for next year, and it's not as if management -- we don't think that we have levers to drive things differently. And we will do it, but we will be benefited in that regard by the fact that the portfolio doesn't all turnover at one instant. And so it's always important to keep those 2 different tracks in mind.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Just a couple of questions. The first is, there was another company that in their pre-announcement suggested some loss pressure in the surety business because of economic conditions. And I was wondering if you're seeing any signs of that? And then, secondly, the favorable development, particularly in the Financial, Professional & International segment, was really quite strong. And I'm wondering if you can give us more color what lines of business, what accidents this year that's coming from -- what's driving that very strong favorable development?\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Sure. It's Alan Schnitzer. On the surety side, we've certainly seen that the same commentary you've seen on others. We're just not seeing that in our portfolio, and I would attribute that to careful selection, and we've been talking about that for a number of quarters and that would explain in part why our surety premiums have been under some pressure. But that business is really all about discipline underwriting and risk selection, and we really focused intensely on credit quality. And we measure the credit quality of our book, and we've got our own proprietary credit scoring. And while I wouldn't say it's an all-time high, when you look at it on a historical basis, it's still very, very favorable and it's where we would've expected to be, thinking back to what our expectations were several years ago. So there's been some movement in that credit quality, but entirely within expectations, and we're very comfortable with the risks in our surety portfolio.\nJay S. Fishman: Just to come back as you went through it quickly, you said premiums were under pressure, that's from a perspective of underwriting thoughtfulness, a voluntary.\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Risk selection and essentially seeding to the market risks that we weren't prepared to write. Your second question related to prior development and it's hard to point to one thing. It expands a number of action at years, expands really all the geographies and there isn't one particular item or trend I'd point out as necessarily driving that. It really is broadly base.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple here. First, Jay, historically, you've given us what the impact of the lower investment yield environment would potentially be on investment income going forward. Could you give us any update on where we stand right now given the current investment yield environment?\nJay S. Benet: Well, yes, I mean, in terms of the basic analysis, it really hasn't changed fundamentally. What we do -- what we've done historically is, we've provided an estimate of how much of the fixed income portfolio would \"mature\" -- and I'll say why, quote, unquote in a second -- over the next 3 years. We don't just look at the maturities as a function of what the documents say. We take a look at, given the interest-rate environment, what's likely to prepay as well. So I think in the past, looking at 2012, we had said something to the effect of about $6 billion or so would roll over in the portfolio, given where rates are, that number will be a little bit higher, possibly $6.5 billion, $7 billion. Although I will say that my own, and this is my view, my question, not even a view, I mean, given what drives that meaning mortgage prepayments, in this environment, it's really not really clear how they're actually going to perform. So it could actually be closer to the $6 billion. But in any event, it's that kind of a proportion of the portfolio, and then the rest is we've given the rates as to what is embedded in the portfolio. I mean, generally speaking, on a tax equivalent basis, it's been somewhere in the 4%, 4.5% range of what's coming due. So it's anybody's guess what rate to use for a reinvestment assumption, I think when we started doing this, it was 75 basis points, then it was 150 basis points. I think if you look at it today, it would be closer to the 150, maybe a little more, so I mean, pick that. But that's basically the nature of the analysis.\nBrian W. MacLean: Also, a lot of fix income securities have periods of call protection. Traditionally, about 10 years in much the muni portfolio. So we have to incorporate that. And that's not really apparent to someone looking at it from the outside unless you wade through it security by security.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Got you. And are you doing anything with your investment portfolio, try to limit the degradation you're going to see in the book yields?\nBrian W. MacLean: We have always operated on the principle that we'll try to get the best return the market gives us, but not more than the best return the market gives us. Actually, right now, we're emphasizing credit quality. Because we think, no matter which way things break, it's going to be even more important than it was 2 or 3 years ago to have the highest credit quality you can. So we're not reaching for yield. We're taking much what the market will give us.\nJay S. Fishman: Brian, just to build his comment further in the portfolio, I don't recall it being structured any shorter from the duration standpoint than it is now.\nBrian W. MacLean: It has gotten shorter simply by mathematical operation. Obviously, as you move along the price yield curve, the slope of the tangent changes, and the duration changes even if the portfolio is unchanged. But our duration is about as short as we would want it now.\nJay S. Benet: And that actually, given the flat yield curve, is really a place you sort of want to be at the moment. And to the extent that we're wrong, and we always consider the possibility that we're wrong and rates rise, we're going to be happy we positioned the portfolio that way.\nBrian W. MacLean: And if they don't rise, we don't think we're much prejudiced.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Just a quick technical follow-up on the investment portfolio. It's just -- the private equity securities, those get marked on a quarterly basis, correct?\nJay S. Benet: They are -- we mark some according to the audited statements from the funds themselves, although obviously, much of the NII from private equity is the result the realizations, when private equity funds sell companies in their portfolio. And there's a slight lag, but it's not great.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. All right. Just most of those private equities -- the audited statements, though, are about quarterly lag, right?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. The other that which is -- that's fine. I just wanted to make sure I had that technique correct. And then I guess either for Brian or Jay. You've talked about what you're doing on pricing as being very much a Traveler specific effort. But are you seeing any signs in the field that your efforts are maybe emboldening some of your competition to potentially take the same tack?\nJay S. Fishman: We've been so focused on our own business and our own strategy and our own steps. I mean, I've been out meeting with agents. Brian has been out meeting with agents. We're just -- this is -- it's absorbing all of our attention. So the answer to that is I don't know.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: And then just on the agency side, on the distribution side, with respect to new business, are you seeing any change kind of in kind of where new business is coming from at this point? And the only reason I asked is just that there has been continued talk by some of the brokers and some of the private distributors that there's increasing churns so just was curious whether or not you're seeing any difference, not really different sources bringing you new business or any differences between kind of distribution coming on renewal, who's bring you renewal versus new?\nWilliam E. Cunningham: Yes, this is Bill. The short answer is no. We're not seeing a change.\nJay S. Fishman: It will be interesting to watch. Obviously, churn is the inverse of retention ratios. And our retention ratios remain pretty high. I would guess listening to a few the other companies over the next few days into what their retention ratios have been will give you real insight into whether that's true or not. From our experience, the answer would be no. But that doesn't mean it's universal.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Just on going back to non-cat weather. So I guess I presume that year-to-date, the entire 4.3 point underwriting deterioration accident year ex-cat for personal lines, that would all be attributed or primarily attributed to non-cat weather?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey, Larry, this is Greg Toczydlowski. Predominantly, that's absolutely true. Close to 80% of it is non-cat weather, and we saw that on both the automobile lines and the property lines.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Okay. And then I think, when you previously had been given -- giving annual earnings guidance, your suggested cat load at that time was I think around $600 million. And from Jay's comments, anybody's guess on normal weather these days, I know it's probably a hard thing to peg down. But is there any guidance you can give us on what a normal cat load is today?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, obviously, when we finally get to our budget for next year, we'll have a number such as it is. The only hesitation is that we're still sort of I'd say in the midst of RMS 11 and what that does to our cat loads. Jay said that it's going to increase some and it will as a result of that program, not so much just to put us out of, in effect, out of policy or out of line with our capital committed to it, but it is going to change. So I just think it's early, Larry. And we'll give some thought as to whether after that work whether we feel comfortable providing some more insight. I understand it's an important factor for everyone to understand, and we obviously have made a disclosure of it in our -- not of the average annual loss, but of our tail exposure in our 10-K. So when we get there, maybe we'll have a basis for saying something about what our average annual loss estimates are.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from the line of Cliff Gallant with KBY.\nCliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Most of my questions are answered. I guess, I could ask on the property lines just to clarify the point. You talk about rate increases being pretty strong in the high single-digit range. But the RMS model changed again, changing your weather expectations. So how should we think about the expected return on the business? And in net, is expected return still rising?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, first, let me -- because I'm not sure I'm connecting a part of your question. Let's make it clear. RMS 11 is, in effect, a hurricane model. What it's doing is it's taking our estimates of windstorm, hurricane windstorm and changing it, which is important in lots of property risks, but not every property risk. We have lots of property risks that are not hurricane exposed. So RMS will have an impact, obviously, on our -- I think in the end what it will have an impact on is our pricing view of hurricane exposed risks. Not everywhere because we're going to get down to the point of identifying where the changes are into very specific geographies. This is not where we get a one-number output, and we spread it for everybody. We're going to use that model and help us drive thoughtful pricing decisions in specific geographic areas. But it's a windstorm focused model. In terms of pricing on property, generally, I don't know what we said. We didn't say a number. We didn't say high single-digits. We said that...\nBrian W. MacLean: Our largest quarter-over-quarter improvement but we didn't give you the numbers.\nJay S. Fishman: And what's really driving that -- and it's important because what's driving that is not yet, I would say, RMS 11. What's really driving that is the experience, predominantly windstorm and hail, tornado and hail, that we've had the last several years. If you go back to -- I don't remember if it was last quarter or the quarter before, we can either make the decision that we're really smart and we've been unlucky or we can make the decision that something different is happening, whether we fully understand it or not, and we should react to it. We've chosen the latter. And as a consequence, if you look in the areas that are meaningfully tornado exposed, we used to talk about tornado alley, the data suggests that's not so relevant anymore. That the people remind me all the time, we have one in Springfield, Massachusetts this year sucking the water right out of the Connecticut River. So as you sit back, as we sit back and just think about weather in fact we're in some cycle, I'm not making any global warming statement here, but maybe we're in a cycle of more active storms, we've got to react, and so our reacting here. And all of -- many analysts tend to think all the time of Homeowners. They immediately go there. We have a substantial property exposure in our commercial book, in our small commercial business and in our middle market businesses. So the dynamic of property extends way beyond Homeowners, which actually, that's the reason I gave the data. We've been achieving 8 to 9 points of what we call their renewal price change for the last several periods.\nBrian W. MacLean: Right. So there, we have been getting high single-digits for a couple of years now.\nJay S. Fishman: That's right. And that maybe where you're getting it from. That was a comment about renewal price, renewal rate change, or price change in Homeowners. But there is a full dynamic of property exposure in our commercial business where, obviously, for competitive reasons, we're not being quite as transparent about what our particular strategies are other than to say it was the largest increase, right, it was the largest improvement.\nOperator: Our last question, coming from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Just trying to get a sense of how systematic the asbestos reserves charges might be. And in the press release, you mentioned the current litigation environment was driving higher settlement costs. Is it plaintive tactics, is it jury wars, is it the bad economy in certain states? Just trying to get a feel for what's continuing to drive the adverse development there and what you might be able to do to try and mitigate that?\nJay S. Benet: I'll try to answer the question and maybe Dorian [ph] or Alan will try them as well. But we make estimates all the time as to what our future costs regarding today. And in this particular case, we had made an estimate that would suggest that the costs would go down slightly. And instead of going down slightly, they went up slightly. We are in a situation where -- and we think is a good thing that the miso cases are the ones that are getting tried. It\u2019s not like many years ago where they were whole package pre-bankruptcies, and whole different set of circumstances. But this is slugging it out on court on a case-by-case basis. And depending upon what the situation is, your defense costs are going to be either smaller or larger than what your expectations are. And they just have been running a little bit larger than what we had previously expected, when we set the reserve. Having said that, we don't view it as any fundamental change in the way the asbestos environment is operating.\nGabriella Nawi: Right. And the only thing I'd add to that is there are several jurisdictions that you see an increase of the attack on peripheral defendants, which really don't have a lot of liability. But those meso cases are fairly serious. And so we're assisting in short defend against them. And so that's what's really driving up the defense cost.\nJay S. Fishman: For the record [indiscernible]\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Now that's helpful. Just to clarify then, so if it's your point, now it is a most mesothelioma cases and that kind of the broad asbestos kind of thing then, I mean, how do we think about this annually? It should be a Decane [ph] liability, yet you're continuing to have issues. So is this kind of the last gasp of this as these mesos move through the system? Or should we think about this being something we have to deal with every third quarter?\nJay S. Benet: Well, we do want to make a point that if you look at the gross reserve increase last year versus the gross reserve increase this year, it was less this year than last year. And as it relates to the population, one would have to believe that there's some point in time where this drops off, now just given the passage of time and the exposure periods, as well as when the asbestos exclusions kicked in, in terms of the way the policies were written. Having said that, whatever this decay rate is, it will be what it will be, and we're trying to estimate it each year. And that's what these adjustments relate to, what's the actual decay rate versus what's been anticipate in the reserve setting.\nOperator: Ms. Nawi, I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with the presentation or closing remarks.\nGabriella Nawi: Very good. Thank you for joining us today. As always, both myself and Andrew Hersom are available for any follow-up questions. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2011 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.  Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.  With that, Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  Given the fact that we disclosed as much as we did at our June 10 Investor Day, our results shouldn't be much of a surprise. In April and May, it was all weather all the time. Total after-tax catastrophe costs for the quarter were just under $1.1 billion, generating a loss for the quarter. The tornado and hailstorms in those 2 months were unprecedented in their size, scope, geographic dispersion and destructiveness. A loss of life was substantial, and our hearts go out to those who been personally impacted by the events.  In that regard, our immediate focus is on delivering outstanding claim service and support to those who have had losses. Our entire claim organization is very much on the case and energized to do this right. We're well aware of the demand that events like this place on the claim organization, and we're thankful for their dedication and professionalism.  We're also well aware that events of this magnitude will happen from time-to-time. It is critical that we price our product and manage our exposure thoughtfully. In that regard, we have great confidence in our data, analytical skill and underwriting expertise. Given the hail and tornado we experienced in the last few years, we are gaining a better and more granular understanding of the tail risk associated with these types of storms. Even in these early days following the April and May storms, we are focusing on improving rate and/or terms and conditions in those geographies that may be more exposed to these kinds of storms than history has suggested.  Importantly, it is events such as these that reinforce our view that the correct way of defining success in our business is to measure returns over time. While we are certainly not pleased that we had a loss in the quarter, we know we are on the right path in running our business appropriately. There is no lack of enthusiasm or optimism here.  In that regard, we are very encouraged that a number of important parameters of our business continue to improve. In Business Insurance, exposure in the quarter improved, and audit premiums, which were negative throughout the financial crisis, turned positive in the first quarter and grew meaningfully this quarter. Perhaps most importantly, we continue to be successful in delivering written rate improvements, particularly in Business Insurance. The overall pure renewal rate gain in Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, was just over 2% for the quarter, demonstrating the success we are having in driving rate improvement. Retention remains at very strong levels, and all of the anecdotal feedback from our organization remains solid. We are executing on this strategy effectively.  As we've said before, we are not waiting for some mythical turn in the P&C cycle to improve our pricing. We are driving rate improvement on a measured basis, particularly for those specific accounts where rate is needed to produce acceptable returns.  We are also encouraged that there are signs that economic activity may be improving. While it remains somewhat anecdotal, I was personally encouraged by the article of yesterday's Wall Street Journal on C2, in which a number of banks reported an uptick in commercial lending. Early results from the credit card sector, as well as results from the tech industry over the last few days, are also encouraging. And while it does seem that we are coming down to the wire with respect to a federal debt limit solution, it may be that they are the beginnings of a bipartisan agreement. And it is encouraging that more states are dealing with their own financial situations, building foundations for an improved fiscal outlook.  Before I turn it over to Jay, let me make a brief comment about our share repurchase philosophy. Simply put, it remains unchanged. Our premise for the creation of shareholder value is that we will generate top-tier earnings and return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The fact that we had a loss in the quarter rather than our historical level of earnings impacted our share repurchases, but only in the second quarter. With less internal capital generated, there's less capital to return.  On the premise that weather patterns return to more normal levels and our profitability returns to historical levels, and to the extent that the capital can be put back to work in our business for growth opportunities, we will continue buying back shares.  Summing up, while the weather was challenging, it is the business we are in. We're doing all the right things and remain on the right track to create superior shareholder value.  And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Jay. There are a few things I'd like to highlight about our operating results in the quarter. First, in early June at our Investor Day conference, we disclosed an expected range of $1.0 billion to $1.05 billion after-tax and reinsurance for cat losses relating to the extraordinary tornado and hailstorm activity that had occurred in April and May. While our current estimates for those storms remain within that range, additional storms that occurred in June brought total cat losses for the quarter up to $1.085 billion after-tax and reinsurance.  Second, we continue to see net favorable reserve development in each of our segments, although at a lesser amount this quarter in Business Insurance than we have experienced in recent quarters.  Third, x cat in TYG [ph], underwriting margins were impacted by several items in the quarter. The re-estimation of certain first quarter non-cat winter storm losses in Business and Personal Insurance, adverse current quarter non-cat weather-related losses in PI for both homeowners and auto, as well as a larger number of large dollar prior losses in Personal Insurance. Adjusting for all of these items, underlying underwriting margins were generally in line with our expectations, which included as we've previously anticipated and disclosed, modest margin compression in Business Insurance, where earned rate increases were not keeping pace with changes in underlying losses.  I'd also like to add that investment portfolio continued to perform very well. Net investment income was down slightly from the prior year quarter as the impacts of lower fixed income reinvestment rates and lower average assets, due to our share repurchase activity during the past 12 months, were mostly offset by strong performance in our non-fixed income investment portfolio.  Finally, our net unrealized investment gains net of tax increased by $400 million from the beginning of the quarter from $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion.  Book value per share of $59.62, although down less than 0.5 percentage point in the quarter due to the cat losses, has increased 2% since the beginning of the year and 7% in the past 12 months. Year-to-date we repurchased 1.3 billion of common stock including 237 million in the second quarter and paid $330 million in dividends. While in the past 12 months, we repurchased 3.5 billion of common stock and paid $659 million in dividends.  Our capital management strategy worked very well in the quarter and remains the same as it has been. Despite the extremely large cat losses, there was no meaningful change in our balance sheet strength between the beginning and end of the quarter. Shareholders' equity and stat surplus was still over $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively. Debt-to-total capital was 22.5%, well within our target range. And holding company liquidity was $2.4 billion, more than twice our target level. And based upon first half results and consistent with our announcement at Investor Day, we expect common share repurchases in the second half of the year to approximate $400 million in excess of second half operating income.  Finally, I'd also like to point out that we successfully renewed our cat treaties, keeping essentially the same structure, but at a slightly higher cost. The new treaties are outlined on Pages 19 and 20 of the webcast and are described more fully on our second quarter 10-Q, which was filed earlier today.  With that, Brian's now going to provide some further insight into our results.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. The obvious headline for our results this quarter was the extraordinary tornadoes and hailstorms that impacted the industry. To give you a perspective on the magnitude of these events, when measured as a percentage of our earned premiums, our cat losses this quarter were 12x our 20-plus year average for second quarter cats and almost 4x larger than our next largest second quarter, which happened to be last year. So clearly, the level of catastrophes we experienced this quarter was extraordinary. And in addition to the weather events that hit the catastrophe disclosure threshold, our second quarter combined ratio was significantly impacted my non-catastrophe weather events and developments on the first quarter winter storm activity.  The significant and unpredictable impact of weather, notwithstanding, we remained pleased with the underlying performance of the franchise and continue to see positive signs across our businesses and in the operating environment.  Beginning with Business Insurance, we had another very strong quarter for top line. Net written premiums continued their positive trend and were up year-over-year, driven by increases in pricing and exposure, along with modest account growth. Retention and new business levels, although down in the quarter, remained at high levels.  Looking at pricing, the momentum we saw in the first quarter accelerated, as the rate was up 2 points compared to 1 point of positive rate in the first quarter of 2011 and negative rate in the second quarter of 2010. We are encouraged that rate was positive for all lines of business, and in fact, increased in all lines of business from last quarter, with workers\u2019 compensation leading the way.  As we discussed last quarter, our pricing strategy is to actively manage rate in a thoughtful and targeted manner that seeks to minimize disruption to our agents and customers. We believe our results this quarter demonstrate that this strategy is working. We also see momentum in exposure, up over 1 point in the quarter compared to being essentially flat both last quarter and the second quarter of 2010. This growth in exposure, combined with the audit premiums that were positive for the second consecutive quarter, demonstrates that the improving economic trends we noted in the first quarter have continued.  Turning to operating earnings. We were impacted significantly by the cats that I just discussed, as well as by less favorable prior-year development versus the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter results have also been negatively impacted by approximately $40 million after-tax or about 2.2 loss ratio points for Business Insurance, due to the re-estimation of certain first quarter losses, primarily related to the development of non-catastrophe winter weather, and to a lesser extent, workers\u2019 compensation.  Overall, if you look at underlying Business Insurance margins on a year-to-date basis, they are about where we expected them to be.  Before I go to the other segments, I want to take a few minutes and talk about workers\u2019 compensation because there's a lot of anecdotal marketplace conversation about the line. Comp is one of our long tail lines of business, with a duration of about 8 years on a new block and 11 years for the reserves. We actively manage all our lines of business, and in the case of workers' comp, our conclusion is that in the aggregate, we feel very positive about our book.  On the severity side, we've not seen any substantial change in the risk. Medical cost trends continue around, in fact, slightly below our expectations, and lost time activity has remained stable.  We are encouraged by the reform activity already approved in numerous states and under consideration in many more. These are obviously aggregate marketplace comments, and there are certainly jurisdictions where we see more challenging environment. And accordingly, we are taking the necessary actions in those states. For example, in one state where we are seeing increased losses along with a more difficult legislative environment, we are achieving rate gain significantly above the average for the line, and in the case of Commercial Accounts, well into the mid-teens.  We also feel good on the frequency side. But there's more texture underneath the trend, and I want to share with you how we look at it. The graph on Page 12 of the webcast shows our workers' comp frequency for lost time claims from 2006 to the first quarter of 2011. The green curve is actual claims frequency, or more specifically, the fourth quarter rolling average of our reported lost time claims at 12 months. Through 2006 and 2007, the trend was consistent with the long-term average of about a 2% per annum decline in this measure of claim frequency. The dotted blue line on the graph shows a hypothetical trend of reported claims, if we simply extrapolate the historical 2% per annum reduction.  With the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, the actual trend began to diverge from this historical pattern. And by 2009, comp frequency had dropped to levels that were unusually low, and in our opinion even at that time, were not sustainable for the long term. Consequently in the aggregate, we were not pricing new or renewal policies, assuming this unsustainable level of frequency would continue. Off of these lows, we've seen an increase of claim frequency, and it is happening somewhat sooner than we had anticipated.  It's important to note that the frequency is still below the extrapolated pre-crisis trend line, which, again, represents a 2% per annum drop in the measure. And while it's early, the most recent data is beginning to point to a flattening. We believe that the movement of frequency trends in the last 3 years have been attributable to the economy. And in that light, recent uptick could actually be evidence of some economic improvement for the classes of business that we insure. So bottom line, although there's been some movement in frequency, it's still at levels that are consistent with long-term improvement.  All in, we believe the prospects to the line are sound, but we're not standing on the side lines relative to pricing. In the aggregate, we are driving for rate. And we are encouraged by the fact that our most significant written rate gains in this quarter are in the workers' comp line.  Turning to Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. Operating income was down modestly from the prior-year quarter, reflecting lower net investment income. Underwriting gain saw a slight decrease, which is the net of a few items, primarily more favorable prior-year development offset by an increase in catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather. Excluding cats and prior-year redevelopment, underlying loss margins were consistent year-over-year, while expense dollars were up modestly due to the investments we continue to make in this business.  In International, net written premiums were up year-over-year with strong results in Lloyd's, Canada and the U.K., more than offsetting the impact of the termination of an exclusive distribution relationship in Ireland.  In both Bond & Financial Products, surety results continue to be impacted by sluggishness in construction spending. We believe we offer a unique value proposition in this business, and we are very satisfied with the margins and the quality of our portfolio.  In management liability, we saw significantly improved production results in the quarter and remain satisfied with our overall returns.  Finally, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture interest in Brazil, which gives us an ownership position in the market leader of the Brazilian surety business. We're pleased about the opportunity to leverage our leading U.S. surety franchise, as well as our other franchises to expand beyond the surety business into the growing property and casualty markets in Brazil.  Moving to Personal Insurance. The weather in the quarter, both catastrophic and non-catastrophic drove the operating loss. Prior-year development for the segment was up year-over-year, driven largely by the favorable development of 2010 cats. Excluding cats and prior-year development, the Personal Insurance combined ratio increased by approximately 5 points quarter-over-quarter. The majority of the increase was driven by adverse non-cat weather losses in Homeowners and even Auto, some of which related to first quarter storms. A smaller financial impact resulted from a higher number of severe fire losses in Homeowners. Turning to production results. We had another good quarter with both lines of business posting growth in policies in force and net written premiums. Renewal premium change was up year-over-year in both Auto and Homeowners and other. Retention remains near historic highs for both lines and new business is solid, but down slightly from recent quarters.  So in summary, while this quarter was a strong reminder of how the unpredictability of weather can drive results, we remain very positive about the underlying strength of the business. We continue to see some improvements in the market environment, and we believe we are well positioned for success going forward.  With that, Jennifer, we'll now open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mark Gelly [ph] from Barclays Capital.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: This is Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. I wanted to touch base on the environmental increase on the reserves, and if that could have any implications for asbestos, given what we saw at the Hartford?\nJay Benet: Jay, this is Jay Benet. As it relates to environmental, I would say that look at the environment itself, there really hasn't been a major change in the environment. We experienced the same kind of favorable trends in claim payments that we had been experiencing. As we've said before, we extrapolate information that we have into some formulaic views of what the ultimate loss costs are going to be. And it doesn't take a lot of change in the actual environment to make for some dollar changes in the reserves. So while I would say we saw the same favorable trends, the favorable trends were a little less than we had anticipated in our calculation. So that was the adjustment, nothing major going on. And as it relates to asbestos, we really don't have any comments to make here. I'd say, overall, the environment for asbestos has not changed fundamentally from the way we viewed it last year. And as it relates to where we are, as you know, we do our quarterly procedures on asbestos. The quarterly procedures didn't lead to any kind of change in the reserve. We also do a real detailed overall claim review that we complete annually. We're expecting to complete that in the third quarter. And at that time, we'll see what the asbestos reserves will look.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: And then a separate issue on capital management. Am I right in thinking that the debt-to-capital level is more of a constraint in terms of how much stock Travelers can buy that at this point? If it's 22.5% now debt-to-capital, what's the kind of range that the company is comfortable with?\nJay Benet: We generally talk about a range of somewhere between 15% and 25% associated with a AA rating. And one of the things I'd point out about the 22.5%, there's about a point of that, that relates to essentially prefunding some future debt. We took advantage of the low interest rate environment last year to do some retirement of our convertible hybrids that we had. But we also had some excess that we just kept on the balance sheet to be able to use to pay off future debt. So as a result, as it relates to that range, we do have lots of flexibility in the range. And we'll continue to manage the overall capital position with that in mind, with the operating company capital being first and foremost, as well as the liquidity at the holding company, which we've already said many, many times has a target level of about $1.1 billion.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Okay. And I just want to clarify that. So does that mean Travelers is okay, going up to 25% debt-to-cap? Or would that be too high to be at that end of the range?\nJay Benet: As far as the rating agencies' discussion, if we did it in a way that took advantage of low interest rates. Well I mean, we have flexibility.\nJay Fishman: Yes, but I wouldn't -- Jay, this is Jay Fishman. The question, \"Is Travelers okay at 25%?\" implies, or the question may imply that we intend to leverage up for the purpose of buying back more shares. And that's just not how we think about managing our balance sheet where the range, at least, as we understand it, that supports a strong AA rating in our business, which is where we belong, is in that 15% to 25%. We always want to leave some flexibility to deal with unexpected issues. We recognize the kinds of events that we saw this quarter could happen again, and they could happen even worse. And so we don't run our business at the edge. But it's that range that really establishes the notion of that 15% to 25% range, is the range that we understand, is in support of a AA rating.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Matthew Heimermann from JPMorgan.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: I guess I just wanted to follow up on the asbestos question. Can you just remind us, because I don't think you report this anywhere anymore, just what survival ratio looks when you adjust for buyouts and settlements?\nJay Benet: Not really a statistic I keep at the top of my head because it's not something we think is terribly relevant. We can calculate -- we get it for you though. And we -- the way of looking at it is a good way of looking at it, so taking out the settlement activity, but we just have to get the data.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Yes, that's fair. I just wondered. I can do the raw numbers, but I suspect there's probably a material difference. So I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly. I guess the other question, maybe for Brian is just could you give us a little bit more color on the rate increases by kind of core product line? And I guess I was thinking about maybe how work comp contrast with property, and how that contrasts with maybe general liability and then maybe other specialty liability lines?\nBrian MacLean: So broadly, as I said, I think, in a couple of spots, the largest increases are in comp. Positive increases everywhere, but consistently, what we in the market have been saying for probably the last year. Property's probably at the tail end of it. So strongest increases in comp.\nJay Fishman: When you say property, you're really thinking about Business Insurance.\nBrian MacLean: Yes. It's all about Business Insurance.\nJay Fishman: Yes.\nBrian MacLean: So on the first party's side, and probably over the last couple of years, the larger the account, the more challenging the pricing environment has been. We're seeing improvements everywhere, so we're encouraged that, again, even on the property side, it's gone from negatives to albeit small, but small positives. We're also seeing in the large property world, a little bit of favorable movement on the terms and conditions rhetoric in the marketplace. And so that's very encouraging in that business and held somewhere in between.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: All right. So if I -- just to restate what you said, if I could kind of think about where comp greater than the 2, pretty much property less than 2, pretty much everything else was probably clustered around the average?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, both , yes.\nJay Fishman: As it relates to the survival ratio that you're asking about, x the settlement activity, it's probably close to 8%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: A couple of questions. The first is just a numbers question. In the interest and other segment, as you break it out, the G&A number was quite a bit higher than it had been running. And I'm wondering what's behind that. The second question, you kind of alluded to the fact that, we're obviously dealing with a debt ceiling at this point and there's been obviously some noise about a potential downgrade for U.S. Treasury securities. Have you thought about the implications? Or should that happen, hopefully it doesn't, but should it happen, what it might be for you, specifically maybe annuities might get downgraded as well?\nJay Fishman: On the last question, Jay, I -- we don't know. I mean, that's the simple answer. It's unimaginable, right, unthinkable that a sovereign entity that has a printing press in the basement somehow makes a decision to stop printing. We don't -- and so I simply don't know. We don't know the consequences of what a technical default, a partial default or anything else might be. We'll play it out as it comes.\nJay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: Fair enough, that's my answer too. I have no clue.\nJay Benet: As far as what you are seeing in interest in other, from time-to-time, we have some items that will impact that. As a rule, we allocate costs throughout our business segments to minimize the amount of costs that's sitting in the interest and other. So it's got a very low base. In this particular case, there was a legal matter that was settled and it impacted it. But it's a nonrecurring item, and that's as much as we'd like to share about them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Just going back to the discussion on asbestos, one of the other companies recently added to their reserves. And they talked about increase their claim activity against smaller peripheral insurers. Am I understanding this correctly that you are not seeing that trend in your numbers?\nJay Fishman: I wouldn't say that at all. I'd say we've been seeing that trend a long time, and our reserves are reflecting that.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: But you are not seeing any comparative adverse trends?\nJay Fishman: Not based on what we had expected.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Okay, that's actually helpful. The only other question I have is on the new business. If I look back over the past 4 quarters, it has trended down. And I'm just wondering, is that a function of your attempt to drive pricing? Or is that a function of competition?\nBrian MacLean: I would say it's hard for me to separate those a little bit. But certainly as any carrier begins to drive for some rate improvement, you're going to get some reaction in new business levels and you're going to get some reaction in retention levels. So that's what we've seen on the Business Insurance side. And we're very comfortable with the trade-offs that we're seeing there in the activity.\nJay Fishman: Why don't you comment on our view of the pricing with new business?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, I think that one of the things we are encouraged by directionally is the last quarter, certainly, maybe 2 quarters throughout this year. That environment, we think, has actually improved slightly. And there's always a delta between, as we've talked about a zillion times, a delta between renewal and new pricing. But that is -- that has shrunk over the last couple of quarters. And so directionally, we feel that's moving in the right place.\nJay Fishman: We've actually gotten a couple of things going on there. The first is, obviously, as renewal pricing lifts, you're working off a higher base. And then I think importantly, but I wouldn't declare a definitive trend here that's unassailable. But importantly, the spread between new and renewal has narrowed, meaning that the gap between the renewal price and new price was wider. Previously, it's more narrow off a higher number. So Brian's comment about it improving is a complex one and really is impacted by both the level of renewals as well as that spread.\nBrian MacLean: And I didn't know if you were talking about just BI. But on the Personal Insurance side, we think there's some of the movement there as the economy and slowdown in new auto sales and shopping and home sales. And then some of it is probably a little bit of reaction to our pricing strategy there.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Two questions here. The first one just with respect to workers\u2019 compensation. You made a comment that you were pricing in line with the trend line versus -- extrapolated trend line versus back in '09. I'm curious, do reserving practices follow the same kind of pattern as pricing.\nBrian MacLean: Yes. First...\nJay Fishman: We're going to [indiscernible]. Go ahead.\nBrian MacLean: Two things. One is we were not pricing fully up on the extrapolated trend line either. We were somewhere in between. And what I think any carrier is going to do is they're going to look at changing trends and they've got to decide, \"Do I ignore it? Do I fully incorporated it? Or do I look at someplace in between?\" And we were someplace in between, and I -- probably, my comments didn't make that crystal clear. So we didn't fully incorporate the downturn. And now I've -- from a reserving side, yes, we will reserve and price somewhat differently in that. As we look at trends and as they emerge, we should appropriately reflect the actual trends reserving for the business that's written and the accident years that those losses are coming from. So we more incorporate into our reserving the facts that we see. Obviously, we're coming up with an estimate of what we think the ultimate is going to be out of those.\nJay Fishman: With the exception of Brian's comment in his prepared remarks that the lift off the bottom was somewhat faster or sooner. However, one wants to interpret it, then we had originally assumed. We've actually, so far, done a good job of ultimately picking the developed numbers pretty, pretty close. We've had a series of years of favorable development in workers' comp because our assumption about development was actually not that. It was less than that. And with the exception of how fast we assumed that bottoming out would move back, is the only area where we missed a little. And I do think it's actually missed a little. I mean, many of you would disagree with that.\nBrian MacLean: Yes. The other point I'll emphasize, Brian, is, again, the obvious, but that's just frequency. So on the clarity side, we feel pretty good about the trends.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank: Terrific. And then the other question, Brian, can you just tell a little bit of, obviously, excluding comps, because you've talked about that, just loss trend, what's going on with loss trend in commercial and then maybe even in personal lines, personal auto?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, on the commercial side, there's really been no dramatic change. I would say on the encouraging side, we continue to feel pretty good about what we see out of the tort environment and how that's been progressing. And otherwise, the trends are pretty consistent with what we've been seeing. Greg, why don't you -- on the personal lines side, Greg Toczydlowski.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Sure. Yes, Brian. Similar story on the Personal Insurance side. Good news on the frequency side, pretty much contained our loss cost trend. We see a little bit of pressure on the severity side. And Brian's comment really talked about that this quarter in terms of the non-cat weather driving that. So we don't believe that's an ongoing trend. We believe that's some fluctuations, so we'll continue looking at the business more over a longer term.\nBrian MacLean: Yes. One place where we see a little difference between the commercial and the personal book, quite frankly, is a little bit on the frequency of the auto side. On commercial auto, we are seeing a little pickup in frequency, and that, we think is pretty directly related to a pickup in economic opportunity for our insured base. And we're not seeing it on the personal lines side because we don't think there's pickup in the miles driven on the personal side. So a little bit of a difference there, but small movement.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Just sort of a quick one on workers' comp. I'm sorry to keep hitting this but -- after the changes you made in the first quarter to that book, can you talk about the difference between premium trend and loss trend? And especially given that you've seen that book increased a lot or, at least, written premiums has increased a lot in the second quarter. And I just have one follow-up.\nJay Fishman: We're going to resist the temptation to make a declaration and try and compare written rate to earned loss trend. We spent some time yesterday trying to understand that issue with real clarity. And candidly, you make so many assumptions about will written trend continue and will -- I'm sorry, will written rate trend continue? And what will happen to earned loss trend, that we're just going to avoid any predictions about whether written trend is running higher than earned loss trend. And I think the numbers, at least for the moment, speak for themselves. I think what we're comfortable saying, and correct me because I'm -- if you think I'm wrong, is not we're not losing ground. I think that's the important comment. We don't believe -- at least at the moment. That can change next week. That can change next month either way. But we feel pretty good that we're not losing ground. And that's, I think about as far as we want to go in an outlook kind of statement about workers' comp.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Okay, that's very fair. One question on Commercial Accounts, I guess, I imagine a lot of the uptick there is also comp. But you're seeing pricing or you're taking pricing higher competitively on those accounts or just in the business you're writing. What's happening? Is it that others are not following? Or is it that people are taking their rates higher? Any notion on what's causing both a raise in rate and also the opportunity to hold business? And I see you retention, but also pickup new business.\nBrian MacLean: Yes, I think it's -- so there's a lot there in your question. We've talked a lot about what we do as a franchise. And we think we've got some real market-leading, distinct competitive advantages in those businesses that, that customers' value and enable us to keep our business and keep it at appropriate rates of return. I'm not sure where the broader market is when -- because I sense a little bit implied in your comment was we're doing distinctly better than the marketplace. I would hope we are. But I don't know exactly what those numbers are.\nWilliam Cunningham: And just to add to that -- this is Bill Cunningham. I think the other thing you have to keep in mind is we don't approach every account the same. This is not a one-size-fits-all in terms of how we approach each account. We try to be as thoughtful as we can in terms of rate need down to the risk based under the risk characteristics that we're seeing. We manage things differently office-by-office based on what we're seeing. Line approach may vary by state. So it's thoughtful, as weighted as we can be. I think it's having a big difference in terms of [indiscernible].\nJay Fishman: I think one of the things that we take for granted that we tend not to speak about in these comments is the risk control approach that we take to workers' comp. It's not an open-to-buy book. It's not that we underwrite any comer that happens to walk into an agent's office. There's an active and engaged risk control process, a substantial engineering group that for virtually every new account in Commercial Accounts -- again, if I'm overstating, correct me. But virtually every new account in Commercial Accounts, we've got our own engineers out in the field, actually observing the risk control practices and procedures of the accounts that we underwrite. And I would speculate, and it is just speculation, that what we're ending up with is a better class of workers\u2019 compensation business from a loss management perspective than carriers who don't bring that level of expertise to the market. And there's an interesting phenomenon to talk about, about what happens to those classes of business and their unemployment statistics and their way of dealing with injuries that's different from the average marketplace. I do think that our risk control organization adds real value here and ends up creating a block of business, a book of business that's just different from lots of other people who write more generally. Not everyone, as there are other people who bring that level of expertise also. But I think relative to those who don't, we end up with a very different managed book of business from a loss perspective.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill.\nJ. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.: I believe, from the presentation we saw at the Analyst Day, that you folks have been having a pretty heavy push into the Midwest in your personalized business. And I'd like to know, given what's happened in the last quarter and we sought that -- a broader sort of secondary question, should we, in general, think of because of the geographic changes in your book, having a larger cat load, overall, in your personalized business?\nJay Fishman: A couple of questions there, and I, first, I'm not sure that there've been any geographic changes, in particular, in our book with respect to your last question. I'm going to let Greg speak to the distribution. But to the extent that one concludes that the tornado peril is more prevalent than it was previously, it's a challenge to deal with that from a risk selection and underwriting point of view. It's difficult for us to determine the difference between Charlotte and Atlanta and Dallas and Houston and Joplin and frankly, Springfield, Massachusetts in this last quarter. So as we think about how do we manage this more effectively, it really does come down to rate and terms and conditions a lot more than it comes down to geographic selection, relative to trying to manage the peril differently. It's one thing to manage coastal exposure. We know where the coast is. It's another to try and manage broad-based tornado exposure because it is just so random, it is so random but so intense at the point of storm. So it's a real tough one to deal with from the selection standpoint.\nBrian MacLean: So, Paul, let me -- this is Brian. Let me take a shot at I think addressing the broad question you're asking, which is, is our exposure going up here? Is our estimate of cat activity going up? Then I'm going to throw it to Greg on the specific on the geography. I think it's fair to say for every underwriter in this industry, while looking at RMS 11 and looking at the wind hail activity for the last couple of years actually, but certainly, this year in particular, we're looking at higher rather than lower. But we're still in the middle of evaluating that whole process. But it's not fundamentally driven by our geographic shift. It's driven by the obvious concerns with the changes in the weather patterns and how we impact that -- I mean integrate that. So Greg, if can you talk about geography? It moved a little.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Sure, yes. We've -- I think we've talked in the past about our agency expansion strategy. And we have had a disproportionate amount of new agents coming in the Midwest and West just because of our heavy penetration in the Northeast. So I think that's some of the data that we have shared with you. We've been trying to respond to a lot of the rhetoric in the marketplace. Is this a new normal for weather? And we just got to go back a couple of years in 2006, 2007 when there was relatively no catastrophes in the marketplace over those 24 months. And we certainly -- the marketplace wasn't saying that's a new trend at that time also. So we're certainly not in the business of guessing what the weather is going to be in the future. We're being very disciplined and focused around our pricing in terms of [indiscernible] and I feel very comfortable around our footprint.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Evercore Partners.\nUnknown Analyst - : Two questions, the first one was on workers\u2019 compensation. I was curious whether some of the adverse prior quarter reserve development came from workers\u2019 compensation?\nJay Benet: Just in looking at the overall line, there was no adverse development for workers' comp this quarter.\nJay Fishman: Prior year.\nJay Benet: Yes, prior year than this.\nUnknown Analyst - : In the prior and prior quarter. Okay, great. The second question is...\nJay Fishman: No, no, no. That's the prior year. Yes, yes.\nJay Benet: No, no, no. Let me just -- because everything before January 1 of this year, in any given quarter, we're doing full analysis of what our reserve needs are. There's always going to be some prior years, we're going to up a little bit, some will go down a little bit. But net-net, there was no prior year development of any magnitude for workers' comp.\nJay Fishman: But Brian did say in his comments, because again your question, I thought, was quarter-to-quarter.\nJay Benet: Yes.\nJay Fishman: Some of the re-estimation of the...\nUnknown Analyst - : Across the year, yes.\nJay Fishman: Some of it was due to the winter storms, and to a lesser extent, workers' comp. What underlies that is a projected increase in the current year loss ratio for comps driven by this movement coming back to trend line faster than we had anticipated. So there was the impact in the second quarter. These, by the way, relative to a company of our size, are relatively small numbers. But what you -- what did was we upped the loss ratio of some a little bit.\nJay Benet: For the current year, right.\nJay Fishman: For the current year. And we obviously had a catch-up in the second quarter relative to the first quarter re-estimation. Mike, did I answer it [ph] right?\nMichael Klein: Okay.\nUnknown Analyst - : Fair enough, understood. The second question is on Homeowners. You are taking up rates 9%. Just curious as to what reception you're getting from the regulators, as well as your customers on the rate increases.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes. This is Greg again. We're, as you see, we've had 9% for 2 consecutive quarters. And currently, we live in a regulatory environment, and so we need to get those approved, either file a news [ph] or prior to approval. And we've got very good relationships with the regulators and our distributors. And there are always cost-based reasons around why we get the rate level, and we've been successful in implementing those. So we obviously are seeing the results around that particular product line in this quarter and believe they're warranted. And we'll continue to watch that and be prudent with the rate going forward.\nUnknown Analyst - : Sure. I was just curious as to why you're not seeing sort of a drop-off in the retention ratios in Homeowners because of rate increases? Would that be because most competitors are taking rates also by some of the levels?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes. We clearly are operating as a function of the market and we're not the only one feeling these catastrophe losses over the last 2 years. So there clearly is an increase in rate environment on the property side. We watch the marketplace quite a bit in terms of the amount of filings that come through, increases, the decreases and the simple ratio. And it's close to a double-digit ratio right now, what the marketplace is doing in that particular line. So clearly we're not the only one taking some rate in that particular product.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair.\nAdam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: You mentioned exposure growth in the Business Insurance is moving positive. How big of an impact are payrolls on exposures increasing?\nBrian MacLean: In comps, it's the whole game. So it's a -- but the biggest driver in our overall results would be GL, which is fundamentally driven by sales and receipts, business receipts. That's the biggest driver. But you can look at our book and you can look at the relationship of comp. And so payrolls have been moving up and are certainly a piece of that.\nJay Fishman: Projected payrolls.\nBrian MacLean: Yes.\nJay Fishman: Exposure is a projected number that our insureds provide us at renewal.\nBrian MacLean: Yes.\nJay Fishman: And then obviously, it gets trued out at audit premium time down the road in the middle market. And so what we're seeing is it's actually there are 2 manifestations of a better environment. First is that insureds are perceiving the environment better, meaning they're anticipating some payroll growth. And then what we're actually seeing in the audit premium numbers in the aggregate. I don't know how the audit premium relates down narrowly to workers comp. But what we're seeing in the audit premium is that in fact, the activity that our insureds, economic activity, ratable activity that they're experiencing over the policy period, is turning out now to be more than they had originally anticipated. So there's 2 elements to it. They're both worth thinking about.\nAdam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C.: Great, that's helpful. And also in Business Insurance, very positive that you're getting rate on the renewal book of business. Is it a several year gradual process to get rates where you want?\nJay Fishman: Actually, it's a very good question and I'll ask Bill to chime in as well. We -- the history on this is that we wrestled for a long time as to how to respond to the precipitous decline in investment rates, which obviously form an important part of the profitability of our business. And when investment rates fell in connection with the prices, it obviously impacted the profitability prospectively of the business that we were writing. The notion that we would have a knee-jerk reaction and attempt to increase prices precipitously, dramatically, never really occurred to us. We always have a mindset about making sure our agents are comfortable with understanding what we're doing and why. And that our insureds understand what we're doing and why. And importantly, we weren't smart enough to know when the investment market would return to more normal levels. And as I commented last quarter, we're beginning to contemplate the notion that the investment environment that we're in may indeed be longer rather than shorter. That obviously back in the third quarter, I think, of last year set us on a path of trying to get rate on a measured basis, not -- being mindful of not disrupting agents' business and certainly not disrupting insureds business. But to do so thoughtfully. If you've got a $100,000 account and you got a 2% rate increase, it's $102,000 premium. And hopefully, we bring value enough to both the agent and the insured that, that's a transaction that we can be delivered to the insured without great concern. So far, so good. But it is so far. And I would answer your question just saying, yes, we think about this as a multiyear effort. It's not -- our strategy in the pricing environment remains intact, driven to a great extent by the declining -- by the reduction in investment rates available and just thinking about the aggregate returns in our business. Now having said that, we balance that out against the notion that cost of equity has dropped dramatically over the last 3 or 4 years for most good companies, anyway. We put up a slide in the Investor Day that showed our historical cost of equity. And then we got into an interesting question of, what happens to the long-term cost of equity? Does it stay down at the levels that they're at, that it's at? And therefore, what levels of returns are going to be available in the marketplace before our competitors step in? And so those are all of the variables that we're wrestling with. The conclusion of all of that, though, is to move for rate gains on a measured basis, thoughtfully, not disruptively. Any of those concerns are dealt with by a measured pace of getting rate gains.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.\nJoshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG: On the charts that you showed about renewal rate change, I'm just -- given the fact there was unfavorable development on 1Q 11, does that change your prior opinions on renewal change? Or is that an absolute number or based on loss cost trends?\nJay Fishman: The renewal rate change is a pure rate number. And I'm looking over at Bill and Fred Donner, a pure rate number calculated at the time of renewal. And so it's independent of loss cost trend. If we had a policy that was $100,000 and it's renewing with exactly the same exposure and exactly the same terms and conditions, and we do our best to analyze them at this level, and it's renewing at the $102,000, that's a 2% rate gain. And so it's calculated, it's expiring premium relative to renewal premium. And it's independent of any loss trend analysis or re-estimation of loss rates.\nJoshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG: Okay, then. Can you comment, in general, on where you see your current growth relative to the rate of loss growth?\nJay Fishman: Yes, I commented on that before. We're going to resist the temptation to make predictions or estimations about whether the rate gains that we're getting, once they are earned, will then offset the loss trend that we are experiencing at that point in time. What we're pretty comfortable saying at the moment is that we're not losing ground. We're not losing ground. There is a comment, as there always is, in the Outlook section of the 10-Q that we filed earlier today, that speaks to what we expect underwriting margins to be. Now remember, that's earned. What's in the 10-Q is purely earned. So it has nothing to do, obviously, has something to do. But it's not a direct function of written rate gains right now. But there is a comment in the Q about what we anticipate underwriting margins to be. But the rate change moves each quarter. The loss trend moves each quarter. And so any predictions that we make are going to force us to constantly go back and revisit whether we were right or wrong. And we're going to just resist the temptation.\nBrian MacLean: In my comments, I said that if we look at underlying Business Insurance margins on a year-to-date basis, they are about where we expected. There's always little movements. But we're talking real little movements here. So rate might be a little bit better than we expected. Loss trend might be slightly worse. But it's netting out to about where we thought.\nJoshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG: And are there any other unusual items besides the catastrophes in the auto combined ratio number? Or it was somewhat higher this quarter?\nJay Benet: It was really all weather-related, either catastrophe or non-catastrophe had a weather impact on it.\nJay Fishman: Partly, just to reinforce that, it's -- I do want to say it's unusual. But most people don't think about the fact that a hailstorm that doesn't qualify as a cat, could, in fact, generate auto losses. So a small hailstorm can, in fact, produce non-cat weather Auto losses. And we've had experiences in this quarter of non-cat weather producing auto losses.\nJoshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG: And can you reiterate your threshold on what's the -- where weather then becomes a cat?\nJay Fishman: I don't believe we...\nJay Benet: Yes, we've never...\nJay Fishman: We've never -- I don't believe that we've disclosed that.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Larry Greenberg from Langen McAlenney.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: I'm just wondering if you might be able to talk qualitatively about Business Insurance reserve development, which is positive, but down from prior-period levels. And I know the environmental was a portion of that. But I guess more specifically, I'm wondering if workers' comp might be playing a pretty significant role in that, given that the trend line was favorable for a while. Now you're saying that it's -- loss trend is moving up a bit more rapidly. Is that a meaningful piece of the lower favorable development? And maybe anything else you might be able to add on that front.\nJay Benet: First of all, I'd go back to what we were saying earlier. We look at our reserves in a very full-some way each quarter. And we evaluate movements and the net result of it is what you see this quarter. I wouldn't read too much into it in relation to their level this quarter versus prior quarters. As it relates specifically to things like workers' comp or general liability or the other components that make it up, if you go back and read through our quarterly 10-Qs, which I'm not urging you to do. But if you did it, you would see that each quarter, there are different elements contributing to the net favorable development. So it's not like you look at workers' comp this quarter versus last quarter versus the fourth quarter versus the first quarter this year. You're going to see any kind of pattern, that say, one particular line has been favorable, favorable, favorable and suddenly it's not. It's a process that we go through that just looks at what's developing in the data. And we make adjustments when the data suggests we should be making the adjustments.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley. [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets.\nMark Dwelle - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: A lot of my questions have already been asked and answered. But the one topic I wanted to touch on briefly, in both the rate and the volume environment on commercial, are you seeing any big disparity between relatively large accounts, mid-sized accounts and small accounts? We've heard a lot of commentary from brokers that there's that type of a divergence.\nJay Fishman: Yes, and the answer is yes, but nothing new in that regard. These are comments you can go back over the last several years, and you'll see us saying the same thing. The smaller account business has been less subject to rate volatility than the larger account business, and the middle market business falls right in between. What I always try to reinforce to people, because I do think that there's any number of folks who kind of misperceive us, what it is we do, we are not broadly speaking a large account casualty writer in particular. We are a small and middle market company that comprises a substantial percentage of our Business Insurance business to the extent we do business with large accounts, it really falls into 2 areas. One is National Property, where as a result of our reinsurance programs, our actual net exposure is not what one would think of relative to kind of large accounts. And then we do fee-for-service business in our National Accounts business, where we're handling claims, workers' comp claims for a fee. And the nature of the risk -- it's not guaranteed costs. It's loss-sensitive business, has a very different characteristic. But most certainly, when you look at our middle market business, which is larger obviously, that our small commercial business, you do we see a more price competitive environment and as we watch broadly speaking into the large account arena, which, again, we don't participate in a dramatic way, in a meaningful way, it is indeed more competitive at that end as well.\nMark Dwelle - RBC Capital Markets, LLC: So that's probably the best explanation as to why the National Accounts' premiums would be, I'll say, the weakest amongst those 3, whereas, the Commercial Accounts segment would really be the strongest and amongst those 3.\nWilliam Cunningham: Yes, but part of it, but be careful to read into that because as you look at the loss response of -- this is Bill Cunningham, that's also a function of a losses under management and largely workers\u2019 compensation. So over the course of the last year as frequency has dropped and the overall losses have dropped, as we look at those renewals prospectively, that has an impact on the premium we charge and the fee that we charge.\nJay Fishman: I wouldn't leap into the conclusion because it's a complicated answer that our National Accounts business, to the extent it shows up as premiums, a lot of its guaranteed costs that's showing up as premiums. And it's not subject to the -- what's the premium basis. Bill is expressing that as the loss content is projected to go down, so do our premiums. They go right along with it. But by definition, the profit margin on that business may not go down in the same way. So the nature of our National Accounts business is such that it wouldn't make a lot of sense. It's not guaranteed costs and it would be -- it's just the -- you get the incorrect assumptions. So look at our National Accounts business at the changes and perceive that it's a function of the competitive environment. There are carriers that have real expertise in dealing with large accounts. And we're just not one of them. And I'm speaking on a guaranteed cost basis. It's just not what we do.\nOperator: And our last question is from the line of the Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.\nIan Gutterman - Adage Capital: I'll be brief. I just had one quick question on Commercial Accounts. I'm trying to understand, but it seems there's some can contrasting trends there. I was hoping to get some insights. The retention pressures seem greatest in that line. And I'm guessing maybe part of that was through the rate increases, and at the same time, your new business is probably one of the better lines there. And the premium growth was obviously very strong, up double digits. So can you help me understand why retention will be getting worse at the same time, new business and overall premiums will be getting better?\nJay Fishman: I -- your statement is factually correct, but the interpretation is a little off, Ian. We -- the fact is retention in the second quarter of 2011 was 84%. From a historical perspective, that's extraordinarily strong. We were coming off levels of 86% and 87% in the second and third quarters of last year, which is candidly one of the factors that led us to conclude that there might be opportunities to gain rate while still improving the overall quality and profitability of the business that we do. So you're right, it's dropped from 87% or 86% in the second quarter of this year to 84%. But that's still at levels that are solid, strong, great, terrific whatever you want -- which one to put on it. And so at the moment while it's dropped the tiniest bit, we don't perceive it at the moment, unless you see it differently than I do, that we've taken a meaningful dip in retention relative to what long-term profits -- relative to the way where we've managed the business to produce returns.\nWilliam Cunningham: On the growth side of the question, there's a number of things playing through there. First, in addition to having continued strong retention, you've got the impact of exposure being positive on renewals. But you've also got the audit additional premium coming through those numbers as well.\nJay Fishman: Yes.\nWilliam Cunningham: And then their rates. So you've got rate gain, exposure gain at renewal, positive audit premiums and those are the factors playing through this that are impacting the growth.\nJay Benet: And the positive audit premium compared to negative audit premium last year. So that's going to have an impact on that percentage growth.\nJay Fishman: Your question is still a thoughtful and substantive one. We will always watch this as we go down this path slowly, thoughtfully. Hopefully, our concept is that we can execute this without trading off substantial amounts of retention. If, in fact, we overshoot and retention drops in a precipitous rate, we'll obviously re-evaluate our view about how we're approaching pricing. But the question's right. I think you just have to put it into a historical perspective to look at it and say, still on track.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to you, Ms. Nawi. Please go ahead.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Thank you for your -- all, for joining us today. As usual, both myself and Andrew Hersom will be available to take any additional questions. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you.

Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG\nOperator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Review for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Great, thank you, Shante. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2011 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.  Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.  Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available on the Investors section on our website. Thank you, and now to Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabby, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now you've seen our numbers, and we're very pleased with our results. At 14.1%, our operating return on equity for the quarter reflected solid underwriting and investment income, as well as the continuation of our strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders.  Our average annual operating return on equity since January 2005, coincidentally, is also 14.1%, within our overtime return objectives and meaningfully in excess of our average cost of equity over the period. The total return to our shareholders over this period is also very strong at 86%.  In Business Insurance, we're also pleased to see the continued success of the pricing strategy we have discussed with you previously, as well as a continuation of improving exposure trends. While Brian will take you through the details, in both Business and Personal Insurance, we were able to achieve gains in pricing, evidencing our view that pricing is an active pursuit, rather than a passive response.  In our Business Insurance segment, almost every production indicator improved this quarter. Retention was up, we achieved pricing gains, and exposure, which is unit demand by renewing customers, improved. In addition, we continue to increase our number of accounts during the quarter. We fundamentally believe that a number of these indicators are the result of active management and not the result of a rising tide lifting all boats.  Our pricing strategy is premised on real value added to agents and customers and our industry-leading analytics, which we apply to pricing and risk selection. Most importantly, we have applied this strategy thoughtfully and with the mindset not to be disruptive to either our agents or customers. These analytics give us very important advanced insight into class and account profitability, not only at the management level but critically at the desk underwriting level, allowing us to better determine account rate needs, risk selection and produce superior portfolio returns over time.  The feedback we received is that both agents and customers recognize the value proposition doing business with Travelers. It's not the insurance agreement, which anyone can write, but the combination of the agreement with market-leading product breadth, superior claims execution, risk control skill, and our extraordinary people with underwriting authority positioned in the local market. Simply said, we believe doing business with us creates value for agents and customers.  As we've been saying for some years now, for a number of reasons, we believe that the amplitude, that is the highs and lows of the so-called pricing cycle in our industry, may very well have moderated significantly. Given our position, as well as the analytic skill we just discussed, we are not waiting for some change in the mythical cycle to seek improved returns. We are increasingly optimistic about our ability to succeed in this regard, given the signs we see of a more receptive environment, particularly because we intend to execute this strategy in a targeted and measured way. It is worth a look at Slide 9, where you can see the actual results of this approach. Brian will have more to say about this later, and we will discuss our view on cycles more at our upcoming Investor Day.  In short, we're pleased with the quarter, and we feel good about our competitive position. We've now seen two quarters of improving rate in Business Insurance and five consecutive quarters of positive rate, while growing policies in Personal Insurance. We like what we see.  With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Jay. As the data we provided shows, we've produced first quarter operating income of $826 million, up 31% from the prior year quarter and up 55% per diluted share, translating into a strong operating ROE of 14.1%. The major drivers of these increases in operating income and operating income per diluted share were a significant reduction in catastrophe losses as compared to the prior year quarter. Cat losses were $122 million after-tax, down from $312 million after-tax in the prior year quarter.  That said, we would still characterize the current quarter as having combined weather and quake-related losses, whether considered cats or smaller events, that were higher than what we would consider to be typical. And we also had tax benefits of $104 million in the current quarter that mostly related to the closing out of recent tax years and the very meaningful effect of our common share repurchase program on per share results.  Net investment income also increased due to solid performance in our non-fixed income investment portfolio. Partially offsetting these benefits was a $37 million after-tax reduction in net favorable prior-year reserve development. Net favorable prior-year reserve development, which we once again experienced in each of our business segments, was $155 million after-tax in the current quarter, as compared to $192 million after-tax in the prior-year quarter.  So, all in all, particularly in light of the higher than typical cat and non-cat weather and quake-related losses that I previously referred to, we are off to a good start for the year.  Book value per share of $59.91 increased 2% in the current quarter, after repurchasing $1.1 billion of common stock and paying $155 million in dividends, and increased 12% from a year ago, after repurchasing $4.7 billion of common stock and paying $657 million in dividends.  Our cash flow remains very strong. Operating cash flow was $633 million in the current quarter, up from $531 million in the prior-year quarter, and we could not be happier with our balance sheet.  And finally, our continued strong results and financial position allowed the company to increase its quarterly dividend per share by 14% from $0.36 to $0.41. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $2.9 billion that was once again well in excess of our target but down from the $3.6 billion we held at the end of 2010. This reduction in holding company liquidity was in line with our plan and relates back to our $1.1 billion common share repurchases in the quarter.  Entering the year, our original estimate for full year 2011 common share repurchases was based upon our estimate of after-tax operating income plus $1.5 billion, which translated into a particular dollar amount at that time. Currently, we have chosen not to change that dollar amount for full year 2011 share repurchases, notwithstanding the first quarter's favorable reserve development which our estimates never incorporate, due to it still being very early in the year and the inherent uncertainties in our business.  Brian is now going to provide some further insight into our underwriting results.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. We had a great quarter, and we're pleased to be starting out the year in such a positive way. In addition to posting strong earnings, we are particularly pleased with what we are seeing in the underlying business dynamics.  Business Insurance delivered strong results this quarter. Let me begin with operating earnings, which increased over last year, driven by lower cats and the tax benefit that Jay mentioned. While cats are lower than last year, it was still a very active weather quarter, and cat losses were higher than what we considered typical. In addition, prior year development was somewhat less than in 2010 but still significant at $93 million after-tax. Core underwriting margins remained solid but contracted modestly as loss cost continued to slightly outpace earned rate changes, in line with our expectations.  Net written premiums grew almost 7 points year-over-year. The increase was driven by improved pricing, renewing customers purchasing more insurance as the economy improved and account growth. Higher business receipts and/or payrolls for these customers drove increased exposure in [ph] units, in our renewal premium. Additionally, audit premiums were positive for the first time since the second quarter of 2009.  Our price change or pure rate was positive quarter-over-quarter and even trended up month-to-month within the quarter. At the same time, retention rose 2 points to 84%. New business flow remained strong, while new business written premiums were down slightly from last year.  Page 8 demonstrates the significant improvement in renewal premium change that we've experienced since 2009. Some of this is clearly driven by the broader economic environment, but it is also a result of how we execute in the marketplace. Much of the market commentary implies that there's only one marketplace and that all accounts renew at the same or similar rates. At least for us, that's not the case. So we're not waiting for a market cycle change. Instead, we believe in a much more active strategy, a strategy based on superior analytics, a broad breadth of products, excellent positioning in the distribution channel and great local point of sale talent.  The data on Slide 9 shows the distribution of price changes on our Commercial Accounts business in the first quarter. This is a midsized account business with over 5,100 accounts renewing in the quarter. In the aggregate, 2/3 of these accounts got some level of increase. But importantly, there's a wide distribution of price changes, with some accounts getting greater than 10% increases and others, 10% decreases. So we believe this clearly demonstrates that it's not one pricing environment and that given our competitive advantages, we can target the accounts that need price and take the right actions deal by deal. Through this thoughtful and targeted execution, we can get rate where needed and minimize disruption to our agents and customers. We believe this dynamic is one that is not well recognized or appreciated by industry observers, and we believe it is meaningful.  Turning to Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. Operating income was up over the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. While written and earned premiums have been reduced in the current and recent quarters, the work we have done to improve risk and reward in the catastrophe-prone lines in our Lloyd's syndicate successfully mitigated losses this quarter.  Net written premiums were down in the quarter, primarily due to the Lloyd\u2019s initiative I just mentioned, the timing of renewal of some accounts written in the first quarter of last year that will become available for renewal later this year and the termination late last year of an exclusive distribution relationship in Ireland that we mentioned previously.  Looking at Bond & Financial products. In Surety, we continue to see a market challenge for growth, due largely to the continued sluggishness in construction spending. In addition, we're beginning to see evidence of more aggressive competition, including relaxed terms and conditions in order to win business. We will continue to maintain our underwriting discipline and look to grow where it makes sense.  In Management Liability, while growth remains a challenge, this is an area where we've invested in new product and technology, and we believe we are well positioned to grow as the market improves.  Finally, I wanted to give you an update on our joint venture in Brazil that we announced in November. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the second quarter and remain excited about the opportunity this arrangement gives us to leverage our leading U.S. Surety franchise to enter the growing Brazilian market and to expand more broadly into PNC and to do so with the benefit of a local market leader.  Moving to Personal Insurance, we are pleased with our overall underwriting results, and we had another quarter of solid production with continued growth in both policies enforced and net written premium. From a financial perspective, reported cats and prior year development for the segment were favorable year-over-year. However, underwriting results were impacted by a significant amount of non-cat weather that affected the industry in the quarter. We remained pleased with the underlying profitability of the segment.  As with our Commercial Lines businesses, we manage Personal Insurance consistent with our financial strategy of delivering mid-teen return on equity over time. As such, we are committed to maintaining target profitability as we look to achieve our desired growth within these confines. To that end, we have been making some targeted but aggressive rate actions particularly in the homeowner space, which has been adversely impacted by weather trends in the last few years. We believe that our rate actions are well justified given these loss trends.  In summary, we feel terrific about the results this quarter. While we are still operating in a fluid and challenging market environment, we are clearly beginning to see some improvement and are cautiously but increasingly optimistic that this trend will continue. Both execution across all our business segments and how we are positioning going forward are very strong.  With that, let me turn it back to Jay Fishman for a closing comment.\nJay Fishman: Thanks, Brian. Just as I've said any number of times before, a lot of our own folks listening to this call, if not today, then they will over the next few days. It was a really busy first quarter for all our folks in claim, and obviously given the activity in April, it continues to be a busy time, and they are all out there hopping. I just want to let them know that we know that, and what they are going to do today and what they do every day really makes a difference for us.  And with that, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Walsh with Citi.\nKeith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: First question just on Business Insurance, the pricing that we\u2019re seeing here. I guess I was definitely surprised about pricing being up and your retention being up at the same time. Now could you just give us a little more color behind that? Was there some potentially pent-up pricing maybe from the recession or are you using -- is this expected frequency ticking up from a recovery that you're factoring into your pricing? Just maybe a little bit more color around that.\nJay Fishman: Let's tag team this a little. It certainly, Kevin (sic) [Keith], isn't driven by a concern about frequency or anything of that nature. I'd say if there's anything in the back of at least my mind, it's that, it's possible that this investment return environment may turn out to be longer rather than shorter. And as I've said on previous calls, when rates change pretty dramatically pretty quickly, we certainly didn't knee-jerk \u2013 have a knee-jerk reaction with respect to our pricing. That would obviously be disruptive to both agents and customers. And now that we're 18, 24 months into it, I think it's prudent that we be thoughtful of the possibility, mindful of the possibility that this could be longer rather than shorter. And so it is targeted, it's moderate, it's thoughtful. And I think that, that slide on Page 9 really speaks articulately to the issue, 2/3 of the accounts, we were successful in getting rate increases. And yet with retention, that stayed at historical levels, historically high levels. So I think it speaks to the value of the franchise. I think it speaks to the way in which the company is regarded by agents and customers. And I think you always have to remember -- there's a tendency of lots of folks to lump all of us together as one industry. We are a small and middle-market company. And if you get a point and a half of rate on $100,000 premium account, that's $1,500. And so, if we do this thoughtfully, and I think in a measured way, we are optimistic that we can be successful. And is there anything, Brian, that you would...\nBrian MacLean: No, I think it's -- that's the message.\nKeith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: Okay. And then the second question would be, if you could speak to the RMS [Risk Management Solutions] model changes on inland wind that we're seeing out there. First of all, do you use RMS? And then secondly, if you could just talk to the changes in your PML in Florida, Texas and the mid-Atlantic from the model changes that we've seen?\nBrian MacLean: Yes. So this is Brian. We absolutely use RMS. But we don't use it exclusively. We use every available model that you can think of that we\u2019re out there working with. So we work with a number of folks. I'm not going to be able to give you an answer as specific as what you asked for. It's a significant change to their model. It's a complicated process, and we've been heavily involved working with them for quite a while now. Some of the things that they're contemplating in the model, like inland exposures from the storm, we'd already been looking at pretty significantly. But there are a number of things that they are changing. And like I said, we're working with them. So it'll be later in the year before we're going to come out with anything definitive on -- as in well into the third quarter probably, before we come out with anything on what the model changes will actually mean.\nKeith Walsh - Citigroup Inc: So would we expect changes in your -- the way you think about capital heading into next year then? January of next year or late in the year is what you're referring to?\nBrian MacLean: What we've got to look at, obviously, is as we sort through all the changes in the model, we've got to look at what that does to our expectation of losses. As I said, it's not the only model we use. So we're going to take that output. We're going to look at the other models. We're to look at all of our internal data, and we're going to assess where that is. As it moves, we can figure the conjecture on a bunch of different possibilities of what that could mean.\nJay Benet: As it relates specifically to capital, we will be evaluating what we think the model has done to our exposure base. So our exposure base doesn't change the models. Measurement of it changes perhaps. But ultimately, we'll be in discussions as I'm sure all of our counterparts will be with rating agencies and see what rating agencies think of the new models. And we start in all of our capital planning with -- as we've said, many, many times before, having operating company capital levels at the AA levels. So we'll just continue to do that process.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Could you give a little bit more color on the action at Lloyds and kind of what you're expecting from that business for the rest of the year? And I just have one follow-up.\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure, Mike, it's Alan Schnitzer. When you look at our experience over the recent years, we've just had more really severity and volatility out of that business than we'd really like. And so we've taken a step back just to reassess risk and reward, and obviously, we're starting on the risk side and taking some exposures down as we think about that and making sure that we're taking all the analytics and thought processes that we have in the U.S. and driving it into those businesses as well. So, we started this analysis in 2009. We worked through that, and slowly, we've been increasing the implementation. And we'll be working through it for a couple of more quarters and starting to look more at the opportunity side as we start to put some of the analytics and thought process in place. And when you look at the decrease in written premium anyway, in the international, if that's what you're looking at, you're only about -- a third of that relates to what we're doing on the Lloyd's book. There's another -- about a third that relates to some timing, some accounts that were 18 months when written and will be available for renewal later in the year. There's a little bit of reinsurance, reinstatement premium, and we've got the termination of the distribution arrangement in Ireland, which will continue for the rest of this year to run through the top line, although that piece won't have a significant impact on profitability.\nJay Fishman: Let me just jump in. I think Alan just because he's leading this effort, tends to kind of understate it a little bit. We've talked for years about the nature of analytical skill and our ability to evaluate risk and reward. In the U.S. and all of our operations here, that skill base was not nearly at the same level in our International business broadly. But I think it was particularly true in Lloyd's, although maybe not, maybe it was more balanced than that. And the effort that Alan has been doing is to bring the same level of analytics, as well as the same level of interpretation of those analytics to the business that we do in our international operations. And so ultimately, it'll turn out, at least initially, to be somewhat smaller. I think it will give us an awfully good platform to move ahead and to build the business with the sense of confidence, the same sense of confidence that we have here in the U.S. So it's very much a voluntary effort designed to bring that risk and reward profile in line with what we do here in the U.S.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Great. And then I have one question in commercial accounts. I noticed in your -- the Q you talked about margins being slightly narrower for the rest of the year in Business Insurance I believe and referencing kind of Brian's point of loss trend outpacing pricing. And then, obviously in the first quarter, you saw a big increase in commercial accounts. I'm just trying to reconcile those trends and make sure I understand on the thought process behind the outlook and then the increase in exposures in the quarter.\nJay Fishman: I think, again, Brian and I will tag team this. First, always keep in mind that our P&L, our GAAP financial statements, are based upon earned premium. And as a consequence, they reflect more of the rate dynamics of the past 12 months than they do the past quarter. You book it -- if it\u2019s a 12-month policy, you book it for 12 months and you amortize it in. And so the rate picture that we're providing this morning is in the written premium arena, which obviously, will affect earned premiums down the road. And what really you're seeing here, at least in the GAAP statement, is that -- and what we anticipated, which is that the earned price, the earned rate that's reflected in earned premium, we expected that to be less than what we were contemplating for embedded loss trend for loss reserving purposes. So as a consequence, we were anticipating a modest margin contraction in Business Insurance. And we are seeing very much that, and it was actually reasonably predictable at the time. So that's the earned piece with respect to written, and there was a...\nBrian MacLean: Just to restate some of the metrics and without being overly precise, but we've been pretty transparent. In the first quarter -- our last quarter, our view on what we were seeing across our Business Insurance market from a loss side was relatively flat frequency and lower single digits inflation on the severity side, and that has not changed. You can see where our premium change numbers were, and you can kind of make whatever estimate you want on where you think premiums changes are going to go for the rest of the year and see when you think those lines might be crossing on a written basis. But we still got a little bit of contraction going. So I don't know of those pieces add up for you.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.: Got it. And then just \u2013 workers\u2019 comp it looked like was a big driver. It looks like just from the math, that most of that -- the change in commercial accounts was workers comp. I guess first question, is that right? And if you could just talk specifically about the decision to pursue more business there and kind of what that means?\nBrian MacLean: Yes. This is Brian again. On the comp side, that is the line across Business Insurance that's growing the most. It's also the line across Business Insurance where we're getting the most price improvement. And I'd say in every line within Business Insurance this quarter, we got from price improvement. But comp was definitely at the front end. Comp\u2019s a line that's gotten a lot of lot of publicity. If you look at our results over the last 10-plus years now, we've run a pretty significant favorable delta to the industry on a loss and combined ratio side. So we feel great about our selection in there. We feel great about our risk control capabilities and the claim capability that we have. And so, it is a line that we feel good about, but very, very select though.\nJay Fishman: Spend 30 seconds on the National Account business and the ability to export that skill.\nBrian MacLean: Yes, I mean, we've got a very large account comp business, which is primarily loss responsive, as in taking credit risk, not underwriting risk. And that has enabled us, over the last 20 years, really, the scale of that, has enabled us to build claim and risk control capabilities and pricing selection tools, which we would not have been able to afford to build had we just had the guaranteed cost book that we've had over the years. So we think we've got a real scale and data advantage here and a technology and tools advantage that make a big difference in the marketplace. So we feel good about our comp book.\nJay Fishman: An example of that is out in the claim organization. You'll actually see nurses sitting side-by-side with claim handlers managing claim. I don't know, what do we have, close to $2.5 billion, $3 billion of claims under management in our National Account business? That provides two things. Brian got it exactly right: an expertise that we can export into the smaller guaranteed cost segments and also a scale because comp is fundamentally a state-by-state business. There are -- and you've really going to get very focused and very narrow in your analysis of it. So the combination of the scale, the expertise that exists predominantly in that National Accounts business is a real competitive advantage.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: Two questions for you. First, kind of following up on the last question, can you talk about the potential for loss frequency to start to increase a bit as the economy recovers? I know that's kind of a broad issue but focus more on commercial, I guess as well as personal. And then, second issue, do you anticipate Travelers\u2019 reinsurance costs could rise, and if that were to happen, would Travelers buy less coverage?\nBrian MacLean: On the loss frequency side, Jay -- yes, clearly as we talked about on the other side of the coin, as the economy contracted, it actually creates a favorable dynamic within the comp world in that most businesses lay off the least experienced workers first and safety gets a little bit better and you're running fewer shifts and all that kind of stuff. If the economy really started to heat up, we would see some of that. We looked very closely, we haven't seen anything yet, and although the movement has been positive, it hasn't been that dramatic that we think it has changed those dimensions. Similarly, as you said, within all the lines, including personal lines, we're looking for any indications that economic growth is going to push frequency up, which it naturally will. I think the bottom line is the same across all our businesses. We're looking really hard, we haven't seen anything yet, and we think it's the magnitude of the pickup in economic activity hasn't been enough to drive that yet. But it's a great question and one that we'll be watching closely.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: The reinsurance?\nJay Fishman: Bill just handed me a note. I think a better estimate of the claim -- I said $2.5 billion to $3 billion of claims under management. $2 billion to $2.5 billion is a better estimate for claims under management in national accounts. A combination of loss response and that which we have, well, due to [ph] service and guaranteed costs -- not guaranteed costs, loss responsive [ph]. We don't actually buy all that much catastrophe coverage broadly speaking. We have $1 billion retention. In the next $1.25 billion, our recovery, and this is round numbers, is about $500 million or so. And that's obviously a pretax number. So at a $2.25 billion loss, we have a $500 million recovery, pretax. We paid whatever we paid for the coverage, on a net recovery basis, in the first event, then you got to pay the reinstatement premium, you actually have modest recovery in that first event. It's really a second event reinsurance program, and we don't actually buy much, except the only area where it's important to us is in the Northeast. We actually have obviously the cat bond, and we have a separate Northeast wind cover that's meaningful given our exposures. And we wouldn't expect -- I don't know how to respond to the Northeast and the bond issue longer term, but in the context of the standard reinsurance market, we wouldn't expect a significant increase in dollars because what we pay for the policy is actually is not all that much. So even if it goes up some, it's not going to be a meaningful change in dollars.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital: So do you anticipate -- I mean, there's a lot of controversy right now in terms of whether all the significant catastrophe losses in Asia-Pacific are going to sort of bleed over to the U.S.? What are your thoughts there?\nJay Fishman: I think you should ask the reinsurers. I have no idea.\nOperator: And our next question is from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Not to make this all about workers\u2019 comp, but I was just curious on the non-guaranteed cost side, with the economy picking up, and presumably, that would mean that the Dallas is under management probably go up too. Is the outlook for the C [ph] income you generate on the business potentially going to get better over the next couple of years?\nBrian MacLean: The short answer, Matt, is yes. We're all anxious and watch the economy and what it actually does, but we're seeing a little bit of a lift, and we would expect that to continue.\nJay Fishman: It's actually interesting the -- I think this is what I'm about to say is correct. The private market workers\u2019 compensation premium was $38 billion in 2007. The estimate for 2010, once all the data is in, is $28 billion. 10 on 38 obviously, almost 25% reduction driven by the combination of lower employment and some decline in rate. So, the change in workers\u2019 comp in the market broadly speaking has been really quite significant, and it will be interesting to see to the extent that employment begins to recover to what extent that $28 billion begins to lift back up in the direction of that historical high.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Just on the -- specifically on the Management Liability piece when I was looking at the presentation in terms of the rate change there, that was one that stood out relative to a lot of the channel checks and market commentaries being a bit different, because most competitors, I think, are describing that as more competitive and rates moving down 5% to 10%. I know some people are minimizing rate declines by changing kind of the position that they have on contracts. So could you just maybe give a little bit more color on that book specifically in terms of just the rate and maybe it's a product issue, too, but...\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure, it's Alan Schnitzer. It's tough to answer those questions because people think about Management Liability broadly again as one thing, and it's really not. We've got different business units, so what we see in financial institutions behaves differently than what we see in public company liability versus what we see in private nonprofit. DNO is different than ENO is different than employee practices liability. So it's really hard to answer that on a portfolio basis. If I think about what's impacting us, the majority of our premium there is in our private nonprofit book, so the smaller account. And the rate dynamic there has been different and I'd say less significant than what we've seen in the larger account side. So that's probably the distinction I would make on rate.\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: Okay. And then how about on the FI and the public commercial DNO side? Can you just give a little commentary to what you're seeing there?\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure. I'm not sure if you're -- if this is about -- if you\u2019re talking about rate of the loss side, but on the rate side...\nMatthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co: More on the rate side.\nAlan Schnitzer: On the rate side, I think that as you get in larger account sizes, almost regardless of the industry or the product line. The larger account sizes are -- the rate environment is more competitive. So I think the same would apply in public company liability and FI as compared to, say, at private non-profit book.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.\nJoshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG: Looking at the resolution of prior tax matters, the one-time tax item? It's consolidated under the underwriting gain, I guess the way you define it. Can you sort of walk through a little bit how that hits the P&L?\nJay Benet: In terms of the way we manage our expenses and income, we, as a rule, take all of the items and allocate to the various business segments. We don't have a large corporate component to our expense structure or our revenue structure, as you can see when you look through the information that we have in our 10-K and 10-Q. So, when we have things like tax matters that get settled, we go back to the segments that gave rise to them in the first place. And to the extent there's a tax benefit, it just goes right back to the segment. So that's what drives the earnings piece of it. As it relates to other elements of it like combined ratio, combined ratio is a pretax concept. So the tax benefit has absolutely no impact whatsoever on the combined ratio.\nJoshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG: My apologies, I misunderstood that. Thank you for clarifying. The second question I have is I'm looking at the historical financials. I noticed in the past, some of the previous slide from prior conference calls have different numbers than the previous ones, in terms of -- is this audit premiums going back and revising the past slides?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, you're talking about the production statistics that we might have on rate and renewal price change and exposure, right?\nJoshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG: Yes.\nBrian MacLean: Yes, so those numbers developed, just like -- not a dissimilar concept to loss numbers developing. So as we go through, we're looking at the monthly/quarterly production numbers. We're reporting the same numbers that we look at internally as to what we think is going on with the pricing and the retention and the renewal. But invariably, they were going to be accounts, for example, that we believe we thought at the close of the month we'd retained and we find out two weeks later that we actually did not. So those come out of the statistics. So the numbers do move.\nJay Benet: And we do put a notation on the slides, as well as anywhere where we provide estimates associated with statistics that we use to run our business that these are, in part, actuarial estimates subject to change, and when they change, we restate the past.\nJoshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG: Very good. And finally, one more question on workers comp. Is there anything, broadly speaking, you can talk to how these statistics look different excluding the workers comp?\nBrian MacLean: No. We don't have them. I mean, we could calculate them obviously, but we don't disclose them, right.\nJay Fishman: We don't disclose at that level of granularity.\nGabriella Nawi: [Operator Instructions]\nBrian MacLean: I would reiterate what I said before, though, is that across Business Insurance, we had great improvement across all the lines of business. So it wasn't just comp, but comp had the greatest.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: My two questions are cap deployment and then the direct auto initiative. On cap deployment, I just wanted to clarify that the guidance was indeed increased from the last time you guys gave us your thoughts. Specifically, it was increased by the amount of reserved releases, as well as the after-tax impact of the tax scheme [ph]. Is that true?\nJay Benet: Actually, I would say just the opposite. We entered the year with a view as to what our share buybacks were going to be. We gave you some insight in the first quarter -- in the fourth quarter press release -- I\u2019m sorry, in the fourth quarter webcast as to how to think about that. It's very early in the year, and we're, at this point in time, not changing our view internally as to what the overall level of buybacks are going to be for the full year 2011.\nJay Fishman: It's worth going back a little bit because this is a little -- it's unusual and somewhat out of context. A year ago we said that we were going to stop giving earnings per share guidance in 2011. But we also said that we would provide meaningful insight into what we plan to do from the share buyback perspective because that's a number that we believed was really not determinable from the outside looking in. So the way that we did that, back at the first quarter was to say that at least for our own planning purposes, that we were assuming that the share buybacks would be our estimate of earnings plus $1.5 billion. And that, of course, allowed observers to make their own estimates. And so, while it's funny to be talking about guidance of an individual item that's not tied in some way to earnings guidance, what we are attempting to say is, notwithstanding the results in the first quarter, whatever they were, at least for our own purposes at the moment, we continue to assume the same dollar level that we did when we gave that information three months ago.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Okay. But I guess from my perspective, we all have different estimates of what the after-tax op income will be. When we exit the year, whatever your after-tax op income is, plus $1.5 billion, is what the share buyback will be for 2011. Is that -- am I understanding it appropriately?\nJay Fishman: Well, the share buyback will be whatever it turns out to be, right? Whatever, and there's a lot of things between now and the end of the year that may, in fact, affect that one way or another. But for planning purposes, what we again tried to give you was at least some guidance, so that you'll be able to make those estimates for yourself. And I think -- not I think. What we're really saying to you is not to adjust to that number on a very granular quarter-by-quarter basis, if we think something has changed, we'll certainly let you know. But, it's not -- it just isn't quite as formulated as the notion of earnings plus $1.5 billion. We wanted to -- the reason we did that was we were intentionally stepping away from the process of giving earnings guidance. And so we were trying to be as transparent as we could in the circumstance and give you as much information as we could, to the extent that there are circumstances during the year that arise, good or bad, that cause us to think about that share buyback in some meaningfully different way, we will continue to give you the insight that we're capable of giving. Our advice here is not to overreact to your perception of the first quarter.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: Great. And then also on capital deployment, could you just address the dividend. The increase is a healthy increase. What is your dividend policy and how did you settle in on $0.41 a share as being the right number as opposed to something else?\nJay Fishman: Well, you know $0.40 could\u2019ve been right also. It\u2019s not -- again, it's hardly that precise. But our mindset has been to set a dividend level that reflects the fact that we're in a business that has great earnings volatility. We always recognize that the 1-in-1,000 event could happen this year. And it could happen twice this year. Just because it's 1-in-1,000 doesn't mean that it's 0. It's possible. So our goal is to evaluate our cash flows, recognizing that the share buyback has reduced the number of shares significantly overtime. Actually, I think in about half at this point, we're down to about half of the shares when we started. So we are able to increase the dividend I think thoughtfully, but always keep it at a level that even looking at the tail risks of our business, it would be unlikely -- I don't want to say 0 again. We\u2019re not a 0 basis kind of company. But it would be unlikely to be in a position of having to make a change in that regard. So, and what we do is to the extent that there is additional capital above and beyond that, we obviously deploy it in the share buyback program. So that's the thinking. And it really, it doesn't -- it actually is not driven by a set payout ratio because our earnings can change meaningfully based upon natural events or otherwise. It's set at a level where we have a reasonable degree of confidence that in a lot of scenarios, that we would be in a position of being able to support a continuation of the dividend.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley: And then just on the direct business, the direct auto initiative, it's obviously growing very -- it looks like it's up almost 50% year-over-year just premiums. There is a P&L drag as well. But just curious, your updated thoughts on that trajectory and where this potentially could go over time?\nJay Fishman: Greg and I will tag team this as well. When we set on this venture, we were very clear and transparent that this was long-term in nature. And we are not yet at that long-term level. We are still very much -- meaning we are still in the process of learning and learning enough to what we hope, ultimately, will put us in a position to be able to deploy the resources of this company in a thoughtful, substantive way and actually grow that business, hopefully, meaningfully. We don't yet know enough to do that. We don't know enough about the pricing of the product. We don't yet know enough about how to convert quotes into sales at a level that's likely to produce a long-term, profitable return. So our investment in this regard is as in effect as little as it can be, while still allowing us to learn as much as we're capable of learning. And that's a real trade-off that we decide every year. So it's still, I would say, at best -- it may not be the early days, it's later, it's certainly further on than that. You will see a change this year in our advertising program to be more of an \u201coperators are standing by\u201d type of advertising. For those of you who aren't old enough to remember what that means, it's really the decades-ago dynamic of call now. Call now, we're going to obviously not embrace the call-now dynamic, but you are going to see more of a drive to action-oriented advertising. And we'll see how responsive that is. I think you can talk about the digital world too, as long as we're at it.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Sure. This is Greg Toczydlowski. Just to echo Jay's comments, I'll start with the assessment. We're as encouraged today as when we started the investment around where the future value of that is. We've spent a lot of time, as Jay talked about, in the advertising arena, not only in creating and executing ads but trying to understand an attribute, the sales across all the mediums, the one that Jay just talked about was on the digital front. We're spending a lot of time inside that arena and really working the search optimization and display-type ads and building good capability there. And I certainly don't want to pick at your words, but there is a little bit of a bias in the industry that -- I think your words were \u201cthe direct auto initiative.\u201d If you look at the statistical supplement, you'll see -- do some quick math and over 40% of the PIF is in the property lines. And we really think that's where we -- we've a long-term strategic competitive advantage there with the breadth of our product and the strength of that property line. And I think consumers have seen that. So in the early days, we're very pleased what -- how we're building that capability and what the profile of the customers look like.\nJay Fishman: We've also hired some two terrific leaders in the last year for that business: one out of Microsoft and one out of the direct industry, not insurance, but someone with real skill in building a direct response business. And so, these are all steps in the right direction to building what we hope will be a successful venture.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.\nLarry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Know that most of the increase in your accident year ex-cat combined ratio for personal was non-cat weather. But you had said in the first quarter, excuse me, coming out of last year, that you expected personal lines premium \u2013 personal lines margins to be improving this year. And I mean, adjusted for the non-cat weather, I'm just curious whether you still feel that way?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Good morning, Larry, this is Greg Toczydlowski again. Yes, up to this quarter, we certainly did see relatively low loss cost trends, both frequency and severity. And we saw rate outpacing that. Clearly this quarter, we could see was in the weather lines, and then we really segment the data and look at a geography level and the coverage line, we could see it predominantly in the physical damage coverages. So when we looked -- that we're expecting normal weather patterns for the rest of the year, we still believe in that statement that our loss cost trends will be offset with slightly more rate.\nJay Fishman: Yes and I've just observed that God has His own plan for the weather. And while obviously that statement is always going to be measured relative to -- in particularly in the non-cat area where obviously, we're out of pattern here for the first three months anyway.\nLarry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC: Sure. I appreciate that. And then second question, Brian, your comments on Surety competition, can you just elaborate a little bit? Is that just coming from the traditional players? Are you seeing any new capacity moving into that area?\nAlan Schnitzer: Larry, it's Alan Schnitzer, I\u2019ll take that. I would say that we are continuing to see a lot of capacity and just a lot more bold activity on the part of previously existing capacity. I wouldn't say that it's necessarily new entrants into the marketplace, although there's always puts and takes on that as well.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jay Cohen with Bank of America.\nJay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: I\u2019ve got two questions. The first is in looking at the Select Account business, and you've had consistent renewal rate improvements there. I guess I'm assuming that a fair amount of this business gets renewed fairly automatically with some modest increases, and it's not too much of a push to get those increases. Is that oversimplifying it?\nBrian MacLean: You know, slightly, but directionally, it's right. And we're obviously looking at that class by class, so it's not -- we talk about the individually underwritten stuff and deal by deal. I don't want to imply that this is just one big bucket. But we are looking at industry classes and kind of bucketing it that way. But directionally, Jay, you're right. A lot of it is automatically handled. On the express side, about 80% of that business goes through without being touched by a person. And there's obviously ability to drive a little bit of price through there that we've been successful with. And like you said, you can see the numbers on whatever that is, Page 11, that would reinforce that.\nJay Fishman: And the statistics I last looked at in Select was that 80% of the accounts have not had a loss in the last 3 years, and as a consequence, the loss experience for an individual account is not terribly relevant but the size of the book and the ability to determine the right price for the class is what the secret sauce is all about. And so that's what we're responding to there is the loss dynamics from a class perspective.\nJay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch: Got it. And then the other question. I forget exactly who used the word, but -- maybe it was Brian, when you were talking about rate increases, you suggested the environment was becoming more receptive. I think most of your discussion on the pure rate environment has been about your efforts to target selectively rates and getting the right price for the right risk, but are you seeing a reaction by your competitors to act in a more disciplined fashion? Obviously it\u2019ll vary a lot by a line of business and by size of account. But is there any underlying trend where that might be the case?\nJay Fishman: Brian and I, we\u2019re going to tag team this a little bit. We often get asked, who's stepping on the gas? There\u2019s lot of different ways to ask that question. And the anecdotal observation that we have to that is nobody. We just haven't seen competition -- we just haven't seen competition where we turn back and we scratch our head. Broadly speaking, you could always find an individual account or an individual transaction that doesn't make sense to one carrier versus another. But it's not as if we look broadly at the marketplace and we say, \u201cGee, we can't figure that strategy out.\u201d And it's been interesting because, again, I think the observers to the industry have perceived that there is someone like that. And I think -- I know there's actually been some commentary to that effect. We haven't seen -- we don't come to that conclusion. And I think it's evidenced in the retention rates that are universally strong amongst the best competitors. Now ours, I think, if you look at the real data, ours is probably the highest. But when you look at what we think of as the great middle market accounts, they're all historically at pretty solid levels relative to their own circumstances, and if there were someone who were really acting that way, carrier or carriers, we think you'd see more churns. This gets back to our view of the kind of the mythical cycle dynamics. I find it interesting that people talk about it being a soft environment. And it may be at the top line. If you look at our earnings per share last year, before tax, look at all the earnings that we generate earnings per share pretax. Last year was actually our best earnings-per-share year ever. And you can say yes, it was favorable development, or it was this or it was that, the negative is investment returns have been challenged, but it's been interesting to us that the observation of the challenging marketplace, and we acknowledge that with respect to the top line, really hasn't translated through the bottom line, so... [Technical Difficulty]\nBrian MacLean: Real quickly, Jay, at the beginning, as you teed it up, we tend to first and foremost look at our own information. So we look at the fact that as I said, throughout this quarter, and really through just about two straight quarters now, month by month, we've seen a little bit of improvement every month in pricing, and this month, we saw retention improved by 2 points, and we look at the combination of those, and it says we're not pushing too hard. We hear the rhetoric and the anecdotes just like you do. One of the things -- one of the reasons why we say we don't see the big amplitude in the cycle is that 5 years ago, certainly 10 years ago, in our offices, there would be all those anecdotes. Everyone would rattle off, \u201cThese are the two or three markets that are behaving crazy in the world today.\u201d And we don't get that same level of noise out of our folks. But you're right. We look at our own information first, and we feel good about our data. So...\nOperator: And our last question is from the line of Vinay Misquith with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nVinay Misquith - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Just to follow up on Jay's question before, has an improving economy helped you and your ability to take rates up?\nJay Fishman: I try hard to separate what we know from what we speculate. I know the data. I know the numbers. Exactly why we've been successful in that strategy would be speculative on our part. It was interesting and I -- you can look at the data, when the economy was deteriorating, going back now just 2 or 3 years ago, we were actually able to move rate in the right direction. Now I don't know that it ever got positive, but it, certainly as the time went on, became less negative. Now that was -- that would be contrary to what one would think. So I'm respectful of the complexity of our industry and the data that comes at us. I can only share with you that we've been -- it would be hard to overestimate the nature of engagement of the leadership in Business Insurance and Personal Insurance with the folks in the field about how to operate in this environment. So I can tell you that the direction has been specific with clarity, one would even argue intense. That doesn't mean intense pressure, but an intense involvement. And whether that's attributable to an improving economy or the value of the franchise, which is sort of the one that I personally endorse, but I\u2019ll leave that to others to speculate more subsequently.\nVinay Misquith - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG: Fair enough. And this is a follow-up to that. How do you see pricing versus loss cost trends for the future based on where you're pricing right now?\nJay Fishman: I assume you're talking about written because earned is what it is. And that's baked in to our -- and I say baked in, it's very, very predictable. But we haven't -- just to be -- and then I'm going to turn it over to Brian. We haven't actually done the arithmetic to sit here and say that if rate continues to improve at this level and loss trend doesn't turn, when written rate would exceed loss trends. So we just haven't done it yet. But we're -- this is encouraging. The last couple of quarters is encouraging. And you...\nBrian MacLean: I go back and repeat the numbers I said before about frequency and severity, and then we're not making a projection of what we think rate\u2019s going to be over the next however many quarters. But we are encouraged with the trends that we\u2019ve seen in the last 5 or 6 months now, and you can do the arithmetic. And we watch the loss cost closely and so any of the variables could move.\nJay Fishman: And again, we've just been a company that has refrained from making predictions about rate. There are so many variables: the economy, energy prices. All sorts of things interact with this. And so we're real pleased with what we did in the first quarter, we're feeling -- as I said in the press release, cautiously but increasingly optimistic, and we'll keep our fingers crossed for the second quarter. That's kind of been -- not that it's about luck but that the environment continues to be supportive of the strategy that we're employing. Operator, thank you.\nOperator: You're very welcome.

Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Given Storm Sandy, we are very pleased to report fourth quarter net and operating income of $304 million and $278 million, respectively. For the full year, we reported $2.4 billion of operating income and operating return on equity of 11% and a 9.8% return on equity. Our financial and operational results for both the full year and the quarter were strong and demonstrate the success of the strategies we have implemented over the last few years. In Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, we continued to achieve meaningful positive rate gains of nearly 8% in the quarter, while retentions continued to remain stable and new business remained at only marginally lower levels. Our Management Liability businesses have also produced similar pricing successes over the past year, achieving nearly 8% rate gains in the quarter. The operating environment for our businesses remains the same. Interest rates remain at historically low levels and weather patterns continue to be uncertain. Catastrophe losses this year totaled $1.2 billion after tax, making it another year with a very high level of catastrophe losses by historical standards. As such, we remain committed to our strategy of pursuing rate gains across all of our businesses in order to improve returns. We are particularly pleased with the rate gains we've achieved over the past 2 years and the compounding effect we are now recording. In Personal Insurance, both our Home and Auto business were also significantly impacted by Storm Sandy. Notwithstanding that impact, we are especially pleased with our Agency Homeowners business, which produced a 96.4% combined ratio for the full year and a 78.7% underlying combined ratio for the year. In our Agency Auto business, while we believe we are very much on the right path, we are not yet satisfied with our results. Our 99.2% underlying combined ratio for the year is not at a level that produces sufficient returns. As we have discussed previously since the fourth quarter of 2011, we have been experiencing an increase in auto severity, resulting in levels that have continue to exceed our expectations. But with the rate increases we have already achieved, earned rate gains exceeded our updated view of loss trend in the third and fourth quarters. In this regard, we are now achieving widening margins and we intend to continue this strategy. Assuming that we continue to achieve rate gains at this level, and the loss trend does not materially increase from current levels, this will result in improved underwriting profitability in the line. Brian will discuss this in more detail later. Turning to capital management, we remain committed to our strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders. In that regard, we repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter, bringing total capital return to shareholders in 2012 to over $2.1 billion, including $700 million of dividends. Since embarking on our long-term strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders in 2006, we have reduced our shares outstanding by $362 million or 52%. Just another quick word on Sandy. The storm had a significant human impact on Travelers, as well as our customers and employees. We're extremely grateful to all the individuals who made personal sacrifices to help us deliver on the promise we extend with each one of our policies. Storm Sandy produced the largest number of claim notices in our history and even in this event, we were able to handle virtually all non-NFIP claims with our own adjusters. Just to give you a few highlights, in total, nearly 5,000 employees contributed to our response, we followed up with 80% of all claimants within 48 hours after their initial claim report and virtually 100% were recontacted within 72 hours and we paid or resolved approximately 90% of our Personal Insurance, non-NFIP claim estimates within 30 days of the first loss notice. These are really solid results that I was able to witness firsthand. Our claims group really makes us proud. In closing, we remain very pleased with the ability to deliver rate improvements across all our segments and generate superior returns over time. We entered 2013 with a real sense of optimism based on the strength of our competitive position. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks, Jay. Let me begin by stating that, as always, we've maintained our strong cash position, ending the year with holding company liquidity of just over $2 billion. Operating cash flows were over $450 million for the quarter, despite the high claim payments related to Storm Sandy, as well as a discretionary $150 million contribution that we made to our qualified pension plan to maintain its high funding level even in this extremely low interest rate environment. Note, too, that for the full year, we generated over $3.2 billion of operating cash flows and, as Jay said, we returned over $2.1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. Turning to reserve development. We once again experienced net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, $222 million pretax for the quarter, up from $126 million in the prior-year quarter. Also, as has been the case throughout the year, each of our business segments experienced favorable development. Business Insurance accounted for a little over half of this quarter's total, driven by better-than-expected loss experience related to last year's catastrophes, lower-than-expected claim department expenses or ULAE, and a modest improvement in Workers' Comp reserves. Most of the rest of this quarter's favorable development came from the Bond & Financial Products businesses within FP&II, and surety and management liability. For the full year, net favorable prior year reserve development, on a consolidated basis, was $940 million pretax, up from $715 million in the prior year. I'd also like to share with you a preliminary view of what our 2012 Schedule P will look like when it's filed. All accident years, other than 2011, have developed favorably, including accident years 2002 and prior, notwithstanding the A&E charges we recorded earlier in the year. Unfavorable development related to the 2011 accident year was small, only approximately $155 million pretax that was mostly due to higher-than-expected severity in Commercial and Personal Auto. Similarly, looking at our preliminary Schedule P data on a product line rather than on an accident year basis, shows that all of our product lines, with the exception of Commercial and Personal Auto, experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012. Commercial and Personal Auto developed unfavorably on a pretax basis by only approximately $110 million and $25 million respectively, again, driven by the 2011 accident year. Finally, I would note that all of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels at the end of the year. Net unrealized investment gains, which were up for the full year, decreased slightly during the quarter to almost $4.8 billion pretax or $3.1 billion after-tax, while book value per share was $67.31 or 8% higher than at the beginning of the year. So with that, let me turn things over to Brian.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. I'm going to give an overview of the segment results, beginning with Business Insurance. Although operating income was down quarter-over-quarter in Business Insurance due to the losses from Storm Sandy, the fundamentals of the business continued to strengthen. As Jay just mentioned, prior year reserve development was favorable and higher than last year, and the underlying combined ratio of 92.8% was a 4-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2011. On a full year basis, the underlying combined ratio improved more than 3 points year-over-year, with about 2 points of that improvement due to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trend. Looking at the production statistics, starting on Page 9, retention continued to be strong at 80%, while new business was up slightly versus both the previous quarter and the fourth quarter of 2011. Net written premiums increased 6% in the quarter, with the largest increase in Workers' Comp, driven by higher pricing on our guarantee cost business and growth in residual market pools. Drilling into the pricing results, renewal premium change was 10%, up about 1 point from the third quarter, driven by pure rate increases of 8% and exposure of 2%. The 8% rate gains we achieved this quarter were up slightly from the third quarter and up 2 points from the 6% that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2011. The rate increases ranged from 6% to 10% across all lines and were once again led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto. I would note that within the quarter, rate change was highest in the month of December, with total Business Insurance rate change of 8.3% and Commercial Accounts rate change of 9.8%. Loss trend, excluding catastrophes, has remained at approximately 4% overall. Specifically, the loss trend concerns in Workers' Comp and Commercial Auto that we spoke about several quarters ago, appear to have mitigated and are trending toward long-term historical trends. So overall, excluding weather, a very stable picture. Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our results in Select, our small commercial business. In this business, we are pleased with the performance of our platform and operational dynamics, and we've seen great success in the marketplace. On the pricing side, as seen on the data on Slide 10, we've also made significant progress. Renewal premium change this quarter was nearly 12%, up consistently over the past 2 years. Along with these pricing gains, retention was up 1 point in each of the last 3 quarters, coming in at 78% this quarter. New business was down somewhat from recent quarters due to an increase in new business pricing. These pricing and underwriting actions have had a meaningful impact on our product, profit margins in this business, and we are very pleased with the results to date. So summarizing the entire Business Insurance segment, we were able to sustain our level of rate gains this quarter on top of the 6% gains from the prior-year quarter. This compounding of pure price improvement, combined with the 4% underlying loss trend, has had a meaningful impact on returns. However, given the ongoing weather volatility and challenging investment return environment, we will continue to -- we continue to see the need to execute on our targeted pricing strategy. In the Financial, Professional & International segment, our operating income decreased by 14% due entirely to the impact of Sandy, largely in our Lloyd's business. The underlying combined ratio improved about 3 points, for both the quarter and full year, driven primarily by increased rate in portfolio management in our Management Liability business, as well as risk selection in International. In Bond & Financial products, net written premiums were flat quarter-over-quarter, with higher production in Management Liability, offset by continued decline in surety volume. In Management Liability, retention remained strong at 85% in the quarter, while pure rate gains increased to 8%, making this the sixth consecutive quarter of sequentially increasing rate. Renewal premium change was 6%, which included negative exposure of 2% in the quarter, driven by a reduction in multiyear policies. In International, net written premiums were up about 4% or $12 million on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by results in the U.K. and somewhat lower levels of seeded premium, partially offset by lower volume in the Canadian surety market. The International underlying loss ratio continues to trend favorably on a quarter-over-quarter basis. I'd also like to note that in December, we exercised our option to increase our ownership interest in the Brazilian joint venture from, round numbers, 43% to 49%. The results in Brazil have been very good, and we are pleased with our progress there. In Personal Insurance, fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by Sandy with after-tax cat losses of $370 million for the segment. Excluding the impact of cats and favorable prior year development, the underlying combined ratio improved over 9 points for the quarter and nearly 5 points on a full year basis. However, to really understand the dynamics in the segment results, we need to look at Homeowners and Auto separately, because they are somewhat different stories. In Auto, As Jay mentioned in his opening comments, we are not yet satisfied with our performance but believe we're on the path to improving our results. We continue to be very pleased with pricing gains, with renewal premium change of 9%, up about 1 point from the third quarter and up 5 points from the fourth quarter of 2011. Retention remained solid at 81% but as anticipated, our new business volumes have been impacted by our pricing actions. These pricing actions are in response to the severity challenges across all coverages that we began speaking to you about in the fourth quarter of 2011. The physical damage severity pressures we saw in 2011 persisted through the first half of 2012 but have since returned to near-normal levels. The bodily injury severity trends, however, have continued at elevated levels throughout the year. In addition to expected general inflation, we believe this increase in bodily injury trend is a result of more severe accidents. There are a number of environmental factors that can contribute to this trend, for example, data recently released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows road deaths for the first 9 months of 2012 increased 7% year-over-year, the largest such increase since 1975. So over the last 2 quarters, severity for all coverages is running just over 5%. With mix adjusted frequency about flat, overall loss trend is in the 5% range. Given the renewal premium change we've been able to achieve over the last 4 quarters, earned rate is now more than offsetting the aggregate loss trend. This margin expansion is somewhat difficult to see in our reported results due to prior period adjustments. On the Agency Auto combined ratio exhibit on Page 16, you can see these adjustments and the resulting adjusted underlying combined -- GAAP combined ratio, which improved about 1 point for both the quarter and full year. So on a go-forward basis, as you heard Jay say, at our current level of rate gains, and assuming loss trend does not increase materially from current levels, this will result in improved underwriting profitability in the line. Turning to Home, pricing was also very strong. Renewal premium change coming in at 13% was up 1 point from the third quarter and up 5 points from the fourth quarter of last year. Retention continued to be strong at 84%, while new business volume was lower than recent quarters due to the execution of our pricing strategy, higher deductibles and other profitability initiatives. Given these initiatives, our core underwriting margins are seeing significant improvement. However, it is difficult to evaluate this line's performance, excluding catastrophes, especially given the last 2 years experience. Accordingly, with the ongoing volatility of weather patterns, we will continue to seek improved underwriting and policy pricing terms and conditions. We feel good about the progress we've made in the Personal Insurance segment, but challenges remain. We will continue to locally execute rate increases, underwriting changes and modifications to terms and conditions to further improve the risk profile and profitability of this business. So in summary, looking across all the business segments, let me reiterate what you've heard from us for the last several quarters. We are encouraged that we've been able to successfully execute a strategy that has resulted in tangible improvements in our underlying underwriting margins. We believe that these pricing and underwriting actions are appropriate, given the current level of investment returns, weather volatility and general loss trend, and we are well positioned to continue to thoughtfully execute on our strategy in 2013. With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. We will now begin the question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Andre, we're ready to begin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I have a question on the Sandy loss. I'm just trying to get a sense of where you might be in the kind of the finality of your loss estimates. I'm particularly interested in kind of cost inflation on reconstruction, if there's a tail from business interruption? And if you can quantify closed versus open claims at this point.\nBrian W. MacLean: So one is -- this is Brian. Obviously, with this magnitude of event, there are always claims and issues that are still outstanding, but broadly speaking, there's no significant issue that we're looking at from the business interruption or liability or whatever side that leaves us feeling that there's a big tail. I'd turn to Doreen on the specifics with the closed claims. If you've got some of that data, Doreen, and want to share it.\nDoreen Spadorcia: I do, Brian. This is Doreen Spadorcia. Jay quoted you some statistics as to where we were 30 days from thinking -- reported from first notice of loss. At this point, since we're further on than 30 days, probably on the property side, we're at about 95% of our losses in that position. In terms of tail issues, on Auto, we still have salvage losses to collect and we're in the middle of doing that, but those we've factored in. And on Boat & Yacht that those losses tend to take a little bit longer as well, but again, all of them have been factored into our analysis. So we're pretty well through most of those claims that were reported.\nJay S. Fishman: And Doreen, my comments were to Personal Insurance; your comments were to all lines.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Yes. Absolutely. Thank you, Jay.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: So just to clarify, you're saying you're 95% closed on those property claims?\nDoreen Spadorcia: Yes.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Wow. And then just on, would -- just one on demand surge, a lot of reconstruction going on in New Jersey. Is that becoming an issue, like it has with past events, or is that under control?\nDoreen Spadorcia: I would say, at this point, our estimates of what we saw when we initially evaluated the property, our holdings, we always have situations, Randy, when someone has additional damage and we look at those. And that's kind of a normal course. But at this point, nothing out of the ordinary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Yes, just 2 questions. The first is in the Personal Auto side, the PIF count shrank, a bit more than it had been. It looks like renewal is relatively stable, new business is down. I'm wondering if you could just give us some color around that PIF growth because that was down a bit more than it had been, and more than we had expected.\nJay S. Fishman: Jay, this is Jay Fishman. I think you're analyzing it correctly. The PIF is being impacted by our pricing increases. We recognize that we're -- in some areas that there are less expensive alternatives that are available to agents and in some cases, they're embracing it. Our pricing strategy is based on what our loss trends look like and the severity dynamic is real, and it is substantive and doesn't appear -- we may be wrong about this, but it doesn't appear to be a Travelers-only phenomena. This seems to be broad-based. So we're taking the actions that we know we have to, to produce appropriate returns over time. And if the policies in force shrink somewhat, that's fine, and we will just continue to price it as we know have to, to achieve the returns that we speak about.\nJay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Makes sense. Second question, in the past, you have given some discussion or guidance around capital management kind of forward-looking. As you look at 2013, can you talk about your buyback expectations relative to your earnings?\nJay S. Benet: Jay, this is Jay Benet. I'd go back to the wording that we had in the Ks and the Qs. Nothing's really changed. We have earnings that we're going to generating. From those earnings, we need to have capital to support whatever business growth we have. There may be some needs like pension contributions into our qualified plan, whatever. We lay those out. But ultimately, the idea behind our capital management strategy is to return all the excess capital that we have to the shareholders, and that'll go back to shareholders in the form of dividends, as well as common stock repurchases. And it's really going to be driven by the level of earnings, ultimately.\nJay S. Fishman: Let me -- it's Jay Fishman. Let me just come back with one sentence on the PIF count. You did see it, but I just want to make sure it's clear. Retention remains stable in Auto. We are not losing existing accounts. What we have done is experience a lower level of new business than historical trends, but retention importantly, is remaining stable.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I have 2 questions here for you. The first one, I was hoping, Jay and Brian, maybe you could comment about where we are with respect to rate adequacy in the Business Insurance area. If I look at it on an at or near basis, it looks like you're probably kind of low to mid-teens ROEs on that business right now, is that correct?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, we -- Brian, it's Jay Fishman. We haven't disclosed what our product line returns are. I think you can look at the overall business and really make 2 adjustments that are available to you, and you'll come up with what, I think, a reasonable way to think about return on equity is. One is, you can easily eliminate the favorable development. And two, I think you can adjust the catastrophe costs back to what a more normal run rate would look like. Those 2 are not identical in the absolute level, but they're actually pretty close. They just about cancel each other out. And if you do that, you'll get to a business ROE overall that's round numbers. And I'm not being precise here because I don't have it in my hand, but round numbers, it's about 10%. Now in terms of -- 10%, to 11%, let's say, and people are looking at me. And the real question that you're posing that's so difficult to answer is rate adequacy in the environment where the risk-free rate is 1.5%. We've talked about -- in previous quarters, we've talked about maintaining our aspirational goal of mid-teens return on equity over time. But we've said that under the current environment, it's simply not achievable, and it remains not achievable. And I think most of us who are responsible for managing complex financial businesses are wrestling with if your cost of equity at the moment is sitting in the 7% to 8% range, what is rate adequacy, what is return adequacy in this environment? This is unprecedented, and I spend -- we spend a fair amount of our time thinking about what level of returns is really appropriate. Because I think one of the risks in managing any business, and I think we saw it in 2008, is when management decides that it's going to try and get blood from a stone, it just doesn't happen. But if you look at it overall, we're sort of in that 10% to 11% range at the moment, and a bunch of factors coming at us. But I know you have a longer question, but that's sort of where we sit at the moment.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Okay, great. And then, the second one is a little more detail on the Commercial Auto loss trend situation there. Is it physical damage, is it liability, what's going on with that line?\nBrian W. MacLean: Within Commercial Auto, it's not dissimilar to the conversation we just had on Personal Auto. So it's fundamentally severity-driven. And at this point, the bigger severity issue is on the bodily injury side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair.\nAdam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: The accident year combined in Business Insurance improved by -- improved materially 400 basis points. Was that all quarter-to-quarter, or was there some catch-up from other quarters this year?\nJay S. Benet: Yes, this is Jay Benet. There really aren't any catch-up adjustments relating to earlier quarters in the year. So that's -- with minor variation on that, that's a pure number.\nAdam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division: Okay. That's -- it was a very good number. Could you ballpark that -- and not looking for an exact number, but I mean how much of that 400 basis point improvement is from nonrenewing poor business versus getting rate versus loss trend and existing business?\nBrian W. MacLean: So this is Brian. Hard to precisely segment that, but I did say in my comments, we're getting about 2 points from pure rate over the loss trend now. And then, there's always other stuff within a quarter that's moving within the loss ratio, so the non-cat weather, other large losses, fire losses, et cetera will be volatile. And some of that was moving to the good. So the biggest driver is the rate in excess of loss trend, which is 3 points? Okay, 3 points in the quarter -- in the quarter, yes, right. So that's the biggest piece of it. Obviously, there's something with the re-underwriting issues in a lasered way that you're talking about, but that is not the broad-based issue moving through the results.\nJay S. Benet: And we don't track, because I wouldn't know how, candidly, to track the improvement in profitability that resulted from nonrenewing accounts. That's -- specifically to your question, that's just not something that I -- that we measure or keep track of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.\nMeyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: If I can go back to Agency Auto really quickly, I think, when we saw the decelerating new business despite, maybe, incremental improvements in pricing, does not mean that the environment is becoming more competitive?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, I don't think it's an incremental improvement in pricing. I'd use a different word, and the kind of pricing change that's occurred here is substantial. And at the Agency Auto level, with increasing use of comparative raters at the agency level, pricing is certainly more important, we suspect, than it was, let's say, 5 or 6 years ago. A greater ability, technological change at the agency level for agents to generate multiple quotes relatively quickly and efficiently so that it's -- the comparison process is just easier. So I think that, that's really what's driving it. This is a meaningful change in pricing, driven by a meaningful change in loss trend and weather and interest rates and all that goes with it, and the price is the price, and it'll show up on comparative raters. I don't believe, I may be wrong about this, but I don't believe that the Agency Auto business has become a business where the only thing that matters is price. We do believe that agents have views about companies and their ability to serve individual customers in certain ways, and that's what we've traded on all these years and continue to now. So whatever the new business dynamics are, they are. We have a really strong philosophy here, which is that volume is not a goal, it's a result. If we do all the things that are right, and we're moving in the right direction, the revenues, the premiums will be what they'll be, and then we manage the business accordingly. And that's really what you're seeing in Personal Auto.\nMeyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's very thorough. The tax rate on the non-net investment income component was a lot lower than, I think, it's been in prior quarters. I was hoping someone can explain that.\nJay S. Benet: I'm not sure that's the case. So if you take a look at the tax accruals, if you were to just separate investment income from the rest of earnings, effectively, what you do is, you take round numbers, 35% of the non-investment income, that's the tax provision or tax benefit, if there's an underwriting loss. And then, as it relates to the investment income, we give you the effective tax rates. So I think if you do the arithmetic, you really come very close to what the tax provisions are.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So I had one question, just kind of looking over the last couple years, looks like you've got 8 points of rate in Business Insurance over the last 12 months or so and then, another almost 7 points the year before that. So 15 points in the aggregate of a couple years, looks like combined ratio is a bit better. Just trying to understand, does that mean that more rate -- we should expect more rate to earn through over the next 12 months? How much of that dynamic is due to mix changes, the Commercial Auto stuff that Jay mentioned upfront, or is there something else? And I just have one follow-up.\nJay S. Fishman: I think we'll answer this in a couple of pieces. First, obviously, written rate becomes earned rate, so yes, what we've written in these last several quarters will convert to earned over the next several quarters, and that's just arithmetic. The -- our intent here is to continue. This was always a granular, active pricing strategy. We've commented before we're not big believers here in sort of mythical cycles that carry the industry up and then carry it down. We think that it is one agent, one underwriter and one account at a time. So this strategy here has been extremely active and very granular and applied to individual accounts, putting rate at accounts that need it, taking all of the factors into account: taking interest rates, taking the perspective of changing weather and taking some of the loss trend that affect some of the lines into account. So that's going to be the -- that's going to be our prospective policy, and we're going to continue to do that. I don't know if you have any...\nBrian W. MacLean: Well, specifically on the mix issue, it's not fundamentally a mix issue. We've talked for a number of quarters now that, although Commercial Auto and comp are at the higher end of the rate change grid for us, it's really pretty broad based, and we're getting between 6 and 10 points in all lines. And we haven't really shifted our line mix significantly at all. So that's not driving it.\nJay S. Fishman: We shared with you in the last quarter, in the previous quarters, the breakdown of the accounts, the segments. The one we show you are the ones that track profitability, a long-term profitability, combined ratio by account -- loss ratio by account, actually. And we said in the last quarter and before that, that our greatest opportunity was in those segments of the accounts that were at the low end of the profitability spectrum. We still believe that to be true, that the greatest opportunity for us in terms of improving profitability is at that less-profitable end of the segment, which again speaks to the granular nature of the strategy that we're applying.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And I just wanted to revisit maybe direct. I mean, we've talked about it maybe a little while back. How are you thinking about that? It looks like the first time that PIF started to fall a bit, maybe ratio. I don't know if that's advertising came down a bit in the quarter on a sequential basis. How are you thinking about that? And what is your outlook for when that business needs to rightsize in order for that to be an area of continued investment?\nJay S. Fishman: No, it's a pleasure. In the direct business, we've been involved for the last, I don't know, several quarters, 2, maybe 3, something like that, in a very granular test of elasticity pricing strategy applied in, I -- 2 or 3 states, I -- where we really didn't have a robust agency business. And we were able to change the pricing in those states, both agency and direct, to begin to test the elasticity of demand in the direct arena. That's one of the reasons why the advertising spend is down, because it's being applied in a very narrow way in these last several months, just trying to drive activity in these 2 states, I'm told. And the results have been extremely informative and encouraging in that we're getting increasingly close or closer to having a pricing schedule, a pricing strategy, that we think can work in the direct arena and can be applied both at reasonable marketing success, we believe, as well as an underwriting success. But we remain some distance away yet from what I would call launching in a broad way, but we continue to make real progress and are encouraged by the results. There's nothing that causes us to think that we should discontinue the spend on it. Quite the contrary, we feel really encouraged about what we're learning and discovering. And as I've always said, the thing that we could do wrong here is have a marketing success and a financial failure. And that would not be acceptable here, so we're going to continue to take our time and make sure that when we aggressively approach the business, that we do so with all the requisite knowledge and learning and skills and with a high degree of confidence in the success of the program.\nOperator: And this line is -- Mr. Zaremski, your line is open.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. I was hoping to better understand the underlying margin improvement drivers within Home. So other than pricing, is there quantifiable elements coming from geographic culling and/or terms of condition changes that you guys have been talking about for a while?\nBrian W. MacLean: Well, first of all, the biggest driver is pricing. There's no question about that. And...\nJay S. Benet: Well, and weather. Yes, and there's been a number of things. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had an unusually high concentration of fire-related losses. This year, we had a low level of fire-related losses, relative to some norms. In addition to that, there was a little more weather in the fourth quarter of last year than this year. So Brian spoke before about just things that happened on a quarter-to-quarter basis that caused some variations but those along with, the major item being loss cost trend x weather, which is a hard thing to really talk about as it relates to Homeowners being lower than earned rate. And if you look at those 3 components, the lower fire losses, the lower weather-related losses, as well as earned rate over loss trend, then that's really what's making up the difference.\nJay S. Fishman: And to answer your question directly: We really don't have a metric to convey to you the impact of, let's say, increasing deductibles on the profitability of the business. We would have to go back and rerun the losses using the deductibles that existed previously, and that's just not possible for us to do.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, as a follow-up to the questions about the capital management for 2013. So I see you've contributed, I think, over a couple hundred million dollars to the pension this year and you have $500 million of debt coming due in a couple months. In regards to the pension, if interest rates stay low, should we expect a similar contribution? And are you guys considering refi-ing with that?\nJay S. Benet: Let's talk about the pension first. If you strip away all that takes place in valuing the -- a PBO versus the assets, there's a normal level of earned credit, if you will, that runs through the numbers. And it's about $100 million, round numbers, a year. So if everything worked in accordance with the assumptions, in a steady state, the pension contribution would be about that. The reason the pension contribution is higher this year is things don't work as a steady state. We had a good return on the assets. On the other hand, when you look at the valuation of the pension benefit obligation as of 12/31, which is a spot rate interest concept that you use, you had very, very low interest rates at that point in time. So we looked at that and said, \"Gee, on balance, it feels like $200 million is the right number to put in this year.\" It got us to a funding level that was high, approximately 90%, which is where we started the year. If rates spike up, we're not going to be terribly overfunded. We'll just adjust future funding accordingly. And that would be a nice position to be in, frankly, if rates went up a bit. But $100 million is what we think about as more of a normal level on a year-by-year basis. As it relates to the debt, as we generally do, we try to maintain full flexibility in dealing with our capital position. So we ended the year, as I said earlier, with over $2 billion of holding company liquidity, which allows us to be in a position of paying the debt when the debt's due to avoid any kind of liquidity concerns. And then we'll just continue to evaluate what the proper structure of our balance sheet is going forward based on interest rates and based on how we feel. But certainly, in terms of capacity, we have the capacity to keep the debt ratio just where it is today if we so choose.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: My first question is on your catastrophe reinsurance coverage, which I know expires on June 30. And maybe this is a bit too early: The -- when you new look towards 2013, 2014, do you think your cat cover will look similar? Or has the thinking changed post Sandy?\nJay S. Fishman: The thinking actually changed a little bit a couple of years ago when we reintroduced -- I'm sorry, when we introduced an aggregate -- cumulative aggregate element to our reinsurance program. And we started that, I think, last year at the July coverage and actually expanded it some effective January 1. We actually increased this cumulative aggregate program, which has the effect of giving us a benefit against the retention in the cat program should the individual events exceed retentions and then cumulatively apply against the overall cat program. With respect to the cat program itself, I wouldn't anticipate any significant changes to that. Our property coverage exposure really has not changed. We were comfortable with where we were last year. It may depend upon pricing move a little bit up or a little down, but the important change, the more important change, is the introduction of this aggregate program to our overall cat merits.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, the one thing I would add is, when we did Long Point Re II, we had pegged it to RMS. And when RMS 11 came out, it raised the trigger points associated with that. And in this [ph] past year, we issued a $250 million cat bond with Long Point Re III. And as Long Point Re II turns itself over, we will probably bring those limits -- bring those trigger points down into something that looks more like Long Point Re III.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Got it. That's very helpful. The only other question I have is on Business Insurance pricing and maybe using Slide 9 as a backdrop, and perhaps this question is for Jay. The -- when you talk to your largest agent or business, post Sandy, is there a greater acceptance on pricing? Or do you think there was an uptick in December, and just based on the economic conditions, it's already beginning to sort of normalize as you look towards Q1?\nJay S. Fishman: I think it's -- well, I think the environment, particularly for the January 1 renewals -- and this is anecdotal, what I'm giving you, because I don't -- we don't have the data yet, but the anecdotal observations for January in renewals and the related rate was very similar in the aggregate to what December looked and felt like. So I don't -- I wouldn't anticipate any immediate change of consequence in January. I -- Sandy is a tough one to really talk about pricing. I think that it continues to reinforce the notion that weather patterns may be changing, and we've been saying that now for a couple of years and embracing that in our pricing strategy. And I suspect -- again, no evidence on this, but I suspect that the storm will simply make that argument easier to make, both at the agent level as well as the insured level. I would tell you this, notwithstanding how -- sort of the perceptions of Sandy, it was in the playbook. The storm itself, the track, the path, it wasn't something that -- as we do our analysis and modeling, that we didn't contemplate. It was certainly there. I think the surprise, to the extent there was one, in Sandy was, to some extent, the timing of it. Meaning, it was full moon, it was 2 tides. There were a lot of ancillary factors that made it more significant than it might otherwise have been. But importantly, the flooding was more severe. And this is really -- it's predominantly a -- I'd say it's largely a Homeowners kind of question with respect to the NFIP program, but it does have its impact on commercial insurance as well. There were buildings that we insured in Lower Manhattan that we would not had contemplated would have been part of a flooding event. The flood coverage that we extended was really episodic for them, meaning we contemplated broken pipes or backup or things of that nature, not a flood coming out of the East River or the Hudson River. And importantly, the dynamic there is the sea level. And this is just from things I read, but sea level is, depending upon who you ask, anywhere from 6 to 12 inches higher in Manhattan than it was about a century ago, driven largely by the melting of the polar ice caps and what that's doing to the water level. So I think what Sandy will do is cause people to think somewhat differently about concentrated flood risk than they had before. It'll take some time, it's a complicated issue. But all of us, I suspect, we certainly are, looking at flood concentrations in the commercial segment and analyzing it with a little different perspective than we did before. Those were -- that was, I think, the big takeaway from Sandy that was different from what we might otherwise have contemplated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: This is a follow-up to Brian Meredith's question before on sort of rate increases in Business Insurance and the ROE, because the ROE right now seems to certainly be pretty healthy [ph], in fact close to about 11% x the OCI. So just first, curious on the Business Insurance front, how do you see rate increases this year versus last year? Do you see them tapering off a little bit? Or are you pushing for the same magnitude of rate increases?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, it's -- as I've said before, it's a very granular approach. We have accounts that are at pricing levels that we're satisfied with, that we feel good about, and we have accounts where that's not the case. And that may be driven by the loss experience. It may be driven by the mix and long tail versus short tail, and the impact of interest rates. And it may be impacted also by geographic concentrations relative to catastrophe management. We look at this very granularly. In some businesses, as we've told you before, we break accounts down into quintiles. In some business, we actually break them so far as deciles. And our pricing strategy is driven by the account and its sports class and its performance and where it fits. So we'll let the -- we will continue to do what we do by looking at individual accounts. We have no artificial limits. We look at an account and we try and understand its profitability and how it contributes. And if it's not contributing in what we think is a substantive way, we have a discussion with the agent. So that strategy is no different than it was a year ago. And we'll continue to do it, and the number will be what the number is. And I do -- I would acknowledge to you that a very important question in all this, and I don't have an answer for you but it's one that I think about a great deal is, again using a 1.5% risk-free rate, what level of overall returns are achievable and sustainable without jeopardizing the risk profile of the organization. That is the question. And we're not there yet, but we're -- so we're going to continue to push.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: So fair enough. And you mentioned that the rate increase is, I think, 8.3% in December, so tipped towards the higher end. Could you give us some color on what the rate increases were in January of this year?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. So when the -- so this is Brian. In the middle-market businesses where we have a little bit better transparency into that, the January ones, the early January that we've seen the middle market look a lot like December, so that's encouraging. Small commercial, it's harder to state, and so we'll get a better look at that at the end of the quarter. But the little peek that we've got is encouraging, but that's -- it's a little window.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay, that helpful. And just one follow-up. From the Commercial Auto, there were some adverse physical [ph] development. If you could please provide some color on sort of the subcomponents of that -- those small fleet versus big fleet, along with trucking, and whether that was more of a severity issue or a frequency issue.\nBrian W. MacLean: So it's a -- just like we said in personal auto, it's a bodily injury severity issue. And it's really across the book of business. So it -- we don't think -- the Commercial Auto book of business, right. We don't think of it as a really lasered underwriting as in a problem in one business, but we're seeing it kind of systemically in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just wanted to -- in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Schedule P and sort of gave us a sneak peek. I just wanted to confirm the -- so the Workers' Comp line has inflected. So I seem to recall that the 2010 policy year developed adversely when we look at the '11 data. And it sounds like, from your remarks, that '11 policy year is going to have developed favorably when we look at the '12 Schedule P. Is that true for -- and this is for Workers' Comp, specifically?\nJay S. Benet: Yes, well, for Workers' Comp overall last year, we did see, as you talked about for the last -- yes, I should get into the years because we're in 2013. Well, if you look -- if you go back a year and you're in the end of -- the beginning of 2012 looking backwards, the 2010 accident year did develop unfavorably at that time for Workers' Comp. If we now roll the clock forward, there hasn't been any further developments associated with the 2010 accident year in 2012. And then if we look at the 2011 accident year for Workers' Comp, a year later in 2012, we've seen some slightly favorable development for that. And overall, in 2012, as I said, our Workers' Comp has developed favorably. So that's the Workers' Comp story. And I think it speaks to what we were communicating a year ago. Given the nature of our processes, the granularity of the data that we have and the quarterly diligence we have, we like to believe that when we -- we see trends early, we react to those trends and we book them and move on.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, good. And I mean, that's a great inflection. Do you -- this may not be fair, but do you think the industry is going to see the same or, as, I guess, your remarks just suggested, are you way ahead of it?\nJay S. Benet: I hope that -- well, we certainly can't speak for the industry. I mean, everybody has got their data, their views, their reserving practices. And I think you just have to look at what companies will be doing. But in terms of our data and our analysis and being able to stay on top of things, we think the numbers speak for themselves.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And last on Comp is just I haven't heard a good explanation: Why did frequency spike up? I think it was a frequency issue, at least at the industry level. With the benefit, in some ways, of hindsight, what is the reasoning behind this, the higher loss trend that came through that was somewhat unexpected that, obviously, now you guys have gotten in front of?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, so we've talked about it a good bit, I don't know, a year-plus ago. But as you hit the economic downturn, clearly, losses mitigated -- frequency mitigated as it usually does. People are concerned with maybe losing their jobs so they don't go out on a Comp claim. As employers lay off workers, they lay off the least experienced first, et cetera, et cetera. And then you would typically see a rebound from that as there's a -- there's kind of a pent-up delay in loss reporting. And so what we saw clearly in our results, we can't speak to the rest of the industry, was that, that spiked up a little harder than we thought it was going to. And so we had a backlog, and so delayed reporting, from the previous years, and that kind of came through. So our frequency picked up. Again...\nJay S. Fishman: It was 2010. It was in 2010 that we saw a spike in what we have come to call late-reported claims, accidents occurring prior but reported in 2010.\nBrian W. MacLean: Right, right. So these are people who maybe an incident in '09 and tried to work through it and by the time 2010 comes along -- and again, we expected some of that. It was just greater magnitude than what we had originally expected. And we've seen it mitigate.\nJay S. Benet: And this is Jay Benet again. I just want to -- I'm being reminded by one of my colleagues, the word \"preliminary\" is a very critical element of my discussion of schedule fee. It is early. We still are putting it together, but directionally, we feel that this is -- what I said before, is where we're going to end up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I had just a couple of follow-ups. The first is on investment income. Can you talk about the seasonality of that? It seems to be stronger in 4Q than in 1Q, and I'm just thinking if that trend will repeat in 2013, 4Q '12 versus 1Q '13.\nBrian W. MacLean: Well, in the fourth quarter of '12, a lot of private equity funds were trying to sell companies because of an uncertain tax filing in 2013. That may be a one-year occurrence...\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I was referring just to the fixed income aspect.\nBrian W. MacLean: I'm not sure there really is seasonality there. I mean, the -- there's $1 million difference where someone seized on. There are 3 elements to that. There's volume of the portfolio, there's rate and then there's calendar days in the quarter. And the net of those accounts for -- generally accounts for any small difference quarter-to-quarter. But net investment income from fixed income comes in pretty much like the tide.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Well, I was looking at fourth quarter '11 stronger than first quarter of '12. And I'm just thinking, well, should we not use that $500 million of after-tax fixed income from 4Q '12 as the run rate for the beginning of '13?\nJay S. Benet: Well, what's taking place in fixed income is there's a constant maturity of certain securities in the portfolio, and they're being reinvested at today's rates. And there's been several analyses we've put out into the marketplace, which I'd refer you to, that talk about some estimates of the maturities in the portfolio, how much the yield is on that block that's maturing. And then you can pick your number whether they're going to be reinvested at 200 basis points; 225; 175, less. What you're generally seeing is a deterioration in the overall yield in the portfolio. It's not dramatic, but it's real. And the numbers that you see in the webcast, in the fixed income slide, are reflective of that in terms of, as you know, quarter-to-quarter comparisons.\nJay S. Fishman: But there's no seasonality in the fixed income result at all.\nBrian W. MacLean: We track book yields quarter to quarter and year to year. And over the 12 months of 2012, book yield of the portfolio declined by 33 basis points. And that's not unusual. But the decline is inexorable until we reach the point at which reinvestment rates -- in which all the securities with high book yields have run off and they're replaced, and that's 2 or 3 years off.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then my separate question is on Personal Auto. To get you to your targeted returns, what type of combined ratio do you feel you need to be able to generate?\nBrian W. MacLean: I would say, about a 97, between 96, 97 combined.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Two questions. First was just -- is -- you've noted non-cat weather this quarter, and that's been a theme all year. I guess I was just trying to get a handle, is there a number you could give us to kind of quantify how much of a tailwind that was this year? And I recognize that we're comparing 2012 to what was a slightly worse-than-normal year in 2011.\nJay S. Benet: I don't know that we can give you a number. I think we try to do it the other way around. Brian's talked about what the impact of earned rate versus loss trend is. And these other things, whether it's non-cat weather or, as I said earlier, we had fire losses in one quarter higher than another quarter, or there's large loss activity. But we try to do it the other way and talk about what's underlying it in terms of rate versus \"loss trend.\"\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Is there a way to give us a sense of whether or not it's -- I would assume -- tell me if this is right, I would assume it's just more a personal lines benefit that it is a commercial lines benefit. Is that perception correct?\nJay S. Benet: No, it's meaningful in both, depending upon the quarter.\nJay S. Fishman: It's not unusual. And I -- we're not, not answering because we don't answer. We're not answering because you're asking a question that's exceptionally difficult for us to actually quantify. It's how much of a -- you're sort of asking, within our normal loss estimates, how much are we relying on of weather, and that's a tough question for us to answer. I -- we do note, though, that it is not unusual in a high-cat year to have lower, what we call, non-cat weather. And I -- and we suspect, can't prove, but we suspect what happens is that some of the claims that would ordinarily show up as non-cat weather get included into the catastrophe estimates, and those customers who had some loss previously now get rolled into here. I -- and it's an anecdotal observation, but it does appear to have some actual fact in the numbers.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: No, that's fair. I guess the fact that you know it's happening, though, makes it a little surprising to me that we can't get a ballpark number but -- because -- you know what I mean, because that implies there's some recognition of the trend somewhere but...\nBrian W. MacLean: But for example, in BI, as I said before, about a 4-point improvement in the combined, roughly 3 points of that is the core price in loss trend. So it's about 1 point of other stuff, a decent chunk of which would be what we're talking about, so -- but it's not...\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes. I was -- yes, can you give -- but do you have that handy for the full year? I mean...\nGabriella Nawi: It's not out. We'll try and take some of this off-line because I know we've talked about particularly what affected 2011 for the full year, and you can see some of that in the run rate. So I'll get you off-line.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, no, that's fair. I just don't want to over- or underestimate the core. I guess the other thing was, should we think about the normalizing loss trend we're seeing in -- or what you characterize, I think, as a normalization of the trends in Work Comp as knocking on the -- to kind of the implied rate need in 2012? I know that's been an area where you've been getting some of the bigger headline gains, so I just wonder -- as we're all really focused on what the headline rate number is, but I'm just wondering if that's kind of a very -- a transparent example of where a headline rate might come in, but when you think about what you're getting relative to loss trend, might not affect that spread whatsoever.\nJay S. Fishman: Well, when -- we're looking at each other. First, I'd make -- we -- in Workers' Comp, most certainly, the rate gains are exceeding loss trend in Workers' Comp, resulting in improved profitability and improved returns. So while the loss -- or the projected losses in Comp are substantive because we -- it's long tail and we're dealing with medical and wage inflation, so there's a real number that we use. We -- it's not a number that we disclose. I think it is proprietary and a pricing strategy element. But we do assume a real loss level in Workers' Comp that contemplates changes in those -- in both wage and medical. But at this point, the rate gains are exceeding it. Now I would remind you that Workers' Comp as a return -- thinking about Workers' Comp in a return manner, that it's real long tail, and interest rates really matter there. So it's one of those lines where the interest rate, long-term interest rate, impact is substantive relative to the returns. So that may be as much of the driver as the loss trend dynamic in that line.\nGabriella Nawi: Yes. And Matt, just to be precise, the only thing we talked about moderating was the frequency dynamic that we've seen in 2011. We didn't comment on the other.\nJay S. Fishman: We continue to assume a real number, both in severity, both related to wage and indemnity. It is just a frequency, to Gabby's point, that is -- that we've seen return back to the normal trend line.\nOperator: This does conclude the Q&A session for the call. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Nawi.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us today. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, you can call myself or Andrew Hersom in the investor relations department. Thank you very much, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today.

Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, October 18, 2012. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2012 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay S. Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we report a very strong third quarter. Net income was $864 million or $2.21 per diluted share, producing a 13.6% return on equity. Operating income was $867 million or $2.22 per diluted share, a record for the quarter for operating income per share. Operating return on equity for the quarter was 15.5%. Our earnings were driven by superior underwriting results, as well as solid investment income. From an underwriting perspective, we benefited from lower weather-related losses, net favorable prior year reserve development, as well as the cumulative effect of rate gains we have achieved over nearly 2 years. In Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, written rate increased to nearly 8% with retention increasing as well to 81%. In Personal Insurance, renewal prices increased in both Auto and Homeowners to 9% and 12%, respectively, while retentions remained stable. Also in Personal Insurance, we continue to execute on improving terms and conditions, along with pricing, and while we are experiencing lower new business volumes, we are taking the right actions in order to improve our profitability and returns. In FP&II, rate increases continued to improve in our Management Liability businesses, reaching 6% in the quarter while maintaining stable retentions. We continue to be pleased with the execution in each of our segments. While we are encouraged by the success we are having executing our granular pricing strategy, I'll remind you that it is not just about the headline numbers, that is what is happening underneath the numbers is the real story. Our success is premised on really understanding which accounts or lines are in need of improvement and which ones meet or exceed our expectations. Brian will take you through Slide 13 in more detail, but the conclusions from this slide are positive. We initially showed you this analysis several quarters ago as an illustration. It is a very summarized look at what we do at a very granular level, and it is also important that you understand that loss ratio performance is only one of the metrics we use to manage our portfolio. And even on this very summarized basis, the analysis demonstrates real progress. It is the package of analytics that we deploy that is illustrated on Slide 13 that gives us the confidence that we will get the right combination of rate and retention on the right accounts that will translate into increased profitability. As we've said before, we remain committed to taking the steps necessary to improve returns. This means leveraging our data and analytics across all of our businesses to underwrite and price each of our products very thoughtfully. We continue to assume that our operating environment has changed. Notwithstanding the benign weather we saw in the third quarter, Mother Nature seems to be increasingly unpredictable, and we believe the low interest rate environment will continue to impact our business for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we will continue to seek improved pricing and take those underwriting steps necessary to improve profits and produce higher returns on capital. This remains business as usual for us. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Let me begin by echoing Jay's comment, the third quarter operating income of $867 million and operating ROE of 15.5% were very strong, and along with the timing of certain payables, drove extremely strong operating cash flows of $1.5 billion for the quarter. As Jay indicated, third quarter operating results benefited from a relatively low level of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses when compared to both the prior year quarter and to what we would consider normal for the third quarter, as well as a significant amount of net favorable prior year reserve development. Operating results also continued to benefit from earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends in 2 of our segments, Business Insurance and Financial, Professional & International insurance, as well as a relatively low level of large loss activity. In addition, our investment portfolio had another quarter of solid performance, driven by real estate partnership and hedge fund returns, and the non-fixed income portion and fixed income investment returns that are in line with our expectations. Another item I would like to mention is that our net favorable prior year reserve development included an addition of $114 million after tax on a net basis to our asbestos reserves. Coincidentally, the same amount added to our asbestos reserves on a net basis in the prior year quarter. On a gross basis, the current quarter's asbestos reserve addition was actually $24 million less than in the prior year quarter. Although the underlying asbestos environment remains essentially unchanged from recent periods, payment trends have been modestly higher than we had previously anticipated, resulting in a need to modestly add to these reserves. Turning to financial strength. All of our indicators remain in excellent shape. Holding company liquidity of $2.04 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total capital ratio now stands at 21.9%, down from 23.4% at the beginning of the year and well within its target range. Net unrealized investment gains ended the quarter at $5.08 billion before tax, increasing by over $500 million during the quarter, while book value per share rose to $67.81, 9% higher than the beginning of the year and 11% higher than a year ago. And during the quarter, we returned $529 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends of $179 million and common share repurchases of $350 million, bringing our total dollars return to shareholders to $1.57 billion year-to-date. I should also note that due to the strength of our year-to-date operating results, we have generated more excess capital than we have returned to our shareholder so far this year, which is strictly a matter of timing. Our strategy of returning all excess capital to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and common share repurchases remains unchanged. As such, we expect that the dollar amount of our common share repurchases during the fourth quarter will be somewhat higher than the $350 million quarterly run rate of share repurchases we have been doing in recent quarters. With that, let's turn to Brian.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. So very strong results. And from an insurance operations perspective, I believe there are 3 key takeaways that apply across all 3 business segments: First, we're really pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy to improve margin, both in the quarter and year-to-date; second, given the interest rate environment, the weather volatility and loss trend, we need to continue to execute on this strategy; and finally, we see opportunity for better results in those areas of our commercial business that are at the lower end of the return spectrum and in the case of Personal Insurance, where weather losses have been most challenging. With that, let me go to the specific segment results. Beginning with Business Insurance. Operating income was up 85% year-over-year with catastrophe losses lower and favorable prior year development higher. Excluding these impacts, operating income was $549 million, up nearly 36% from the prior year quarter and the combined ratio improved more than 6 points. The strong results this quarter were driven primarily by earned rate increases in excess of loss cost trends and lower non-cat weather-related losses. Looking at the production statistics starting on Page 9, we saw renewal premium change, pure rate and retention all increased in the quarter. Renewal premium change was 9.3%; rate, 7.8% and retention was above 81%. The rate progress that we continued to achieve was broad-based with increases between 6% and 10% across all lines led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto. These increases in pricing, along with the growth in exposures and audit premiums helped to drive net written premiums up 5% year-over-year. New business was somewhat lower in the quarter as it has been for the last several quarters. Over time, pricing on the new business we've written has improved. But given our strategy to improve margins, we remain very comfortable with the volume tradeoff. We're obviously pleased with the aggregate production results, but are even more pleased when we look at our execution on a more granular basis. Slide 13 shows our renewal rate change and retention data for Commercial Accounts for both the second and third quarters, segmented by the individual accounts long-term loss ratio. We have shown you this data before, but are now adding a comparison to last quarter. The bars on the left represent our best-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios of less than 60%. And the bars on the right represent our worst-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%. For context, the bulk of our business is in the less than 60% loss ratio band, while about 15% falls in the greater than 90% band. You can see on the slide that for our best-performing business, rate has held steady while retention improved modestly from the second quarter. In the middle tier, rate improved over 2.5 points while retention increased nearly 5 points. And for our worst-performing business, rate increased over 1 point to 18% while retention improved slightly. What this data tells us is that we're doing a great job of retaining our best business, improving the profitability of the middle tier and that we have an opportunity to potentially get higher rate increases on our poor performing accounts. So as we've said many times, it's not a one-size-fits-all strategy and you can see that very clearly in this data. As you evaluate the slide, it emphasizes several points: First, actual pricing and underwriting decisions are made on an individual account basis and include many additional dimensions beyond loss ratio; second, the exhibit presents highly summarized data, and we actually measure and manage our performance on a much more granular level by business, product line, industry and geography; and finally, key to this analysis is our ability to measure returns on allocated capital at the individual account level for these individually underwritten businesses. Slide 13 focuses on Commercial Accounts, which is our largest individually underwritten middle-market business. But our focused pricing and underwriting approach also applies to our commercial flow business, Select Express, which is the small account end of our Select business. If we were to display the Select Express business in a similar fashion, as we did for Commercial Accounts, you would get a broad array. In terms of loss ratio, the CMP product would be in the middle tier. And similar to the middle tier for Commercial Accounts, we're improving profitability in the case of Select Express with renewal premium change on CMP in the mid-teens. Our monoline Commercial Auto product within express, which is less than $100 million of written premium, would be at the poorer performing end of the spectrum. And so where our data analytics suggest for the Select Express book, we are focused on underwriting and pricing actions. Again, this is another example of how we apply our powerful analytic tools to drive superior results. In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, we once again posted strong results with operating income for the quarter of $180 million. This is down year-over-year due to a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development. In Bond & Financial Products, net written premiums were down just slightly quarter-over-quarter as the continued decrease in surety volumes was partially offset by higher volumes in our Management Liability business, notably in those areas that are producing higher returns. In Management Liability, renewal rate change, which came in at 6% for the quarter, has increased sequentially in each of the last 5 quarters. It also increased from month to month within the quarter. Management Liability retention was a strong 86% in the quarter. In International, net written premiums were up 24% or $66 million on a constant currency basis. 1/3 of that is due to lower surety volumes in Canada and our exit from personal lines in Ireland. Nearly 1/3 is due to policies that were written last year with terms of around 18 months and so they didn't come up for renewal in the quarter, and a smaller piece or about $12 million is due to disciplined underwriting in our businesses in Lloyd's in Canada. The risk and reward work we've done in international continues to pay off as the underlying loss ratio continues to trend favorably. In Personal Insurance, results for the quarter benefited from a year-over-year decrease in the level of catastrophe losses along with an increase in favorable prior year reserve development. Excluding cats and PYD, operating income of $190 million was up 23% from the third quarter of 2011. This increase, along with the related improvement in the underlying combined ratio is largely attributable to favorable non-cat weather. As we seek improved returns in this segment, we are particularly pleased with the significant pricing gains we continue to achieve in both Auto and Home. Auto renewal premium change was 8.7% for the third quarter, up over 3 points from the second quarter, while Homeowners was up over 1 point to 12.4%. Turning to Auto margins. We've achieved a meaningful written rate increase over the past few quarters which are just beginning to earn in. In terms of loss trend, severity continues to run at mid-single digits, while frequency, when mix adjusted, is about flat. So we're pleased with the progress we've made to this point but see the need to remain disciplined in our pricing strategy going forward. In Homeowners, the story continues to be about weather. Roughly 60% of our loss dollars in Homeowners are driven by weather. So obviously, frequency and severity trends for this line are also driven by the weather. Because of the volatility in weather, in addition to the 12% renewal premium change that we achieved in the quarter, we continued to aggressively pursue terms and conditions changes that both reduce risk and improve returns. The rollout of these modifications is ongoing, but our progress to date has been substantial. In the last 12 months, we've made underwriting guideline changes and increased deductibles in more than 40 states. So we feel good about the progress, but we see the need to continue to push these levers going forward. With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Andre, we are ready to start the Q&A session. And if I could please ask participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I was wondering if you could provide a breakout of the reserve release by business line within the commercial line. So the $208 million outside of the A&E, just wondering where that broke out and specially with Worker's Comp, wanting to see if that was net redundant and especially in recent accident years.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, this is Jay Benet. So we look at what's taking price in terms of reserve development in Business Insurance. As we said, it's net about $41 million. And if we look at the components of that property as a big component, if we look at favorable loss development, where did it come from, the recent accident years, 2011, was a big driver of that. And we also had some better salvage and subrogation recoveries in some of the older years than we had expected. Some other areas, CMP, same sort of thing in terms of the property-related items. Worker's comp actually developed a little favorably mostly due to some of the tabular claims that we had for accident years 2010 and prior. We had some strengthening of Commercial Auto given some of the claim severity that we've been seeing in recent accident years that we've been talking about. But net-net, as you saw, everything was on -- was favorable.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: And I guess, I mean, did that -- I appreciate the color. I mean, so the Worker's Comp was stable, which is, I think, unique to Travelers. But kind of stepping back, I mean, how should we think about where the reserve trends going overall. For the industry overall, I think, the expectation is that redundancies would diminish. Travelers has had an excellent reserve result. But as this goes forward, should we think of this redundancy as winding down?\nJay S. Fishman: We don't make any predictions whatsoever about where our reserve development is going. We make our best estimate every quarter and we stand by that. And then, as the data develops, as more information comes in, we adjust the reserves accordingly.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: And just one more on comp and then the accident year '11, was there -- was that also favorable or was that deficient?\nJay S. Fishman: In the quarter, it was essentially breakeven. It was a tiny bit -- we had a tiny bit of strengthening in the 2011 accident year in the third quarter. It was under $10 million. So this is kind of the quarterly analysis that we do to get things right and effectively given the size of the reserves, we're talking about rounding them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: The underlying combined ratio improvement within the BI segment clearly very healthy. Can you provide any color on which lines of business within the segment are exhibiting the most and/or least margin improvement?\nBrian W. MacLean: This is Brian, Mike. I would say it's pretty broad based. As we've said, comp and auto have been getting the most rate increases, but the range across the lines is 6% to 10%. So everybody is getting some significant rate. As Jay Benet just mentioned, Auto is one of the lines we're seeing a little more heat, so we need the rate there. But I think that by and large, it's been really across the board with our products.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. In terms of -- if you're getting -- what kind of rate increase are we getting in commercial auto then? Because it seems like we've been -- it feels like you guys have been getting healthy rate increases for a while now and you're still talking about margins not being that great in that line.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. I think about 9. Yes, 9 points in auto and comp was around 10, so those were at the top end of the spectrum. Which I think it's consistent with what we've shown in the past. We've talked about and others have talked about the bodily injury trends in the auto business, both commercial And Personal. And so that's been one of the reasons why we're getting those increases.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then as a follow-up in regards to rate increases across all of the segments. Is there a dynamic of stronger momentum in some of the longer tail lines that are more impacted by the low interest rate environment? And are you at all surprised at how well retention is holding up in the face of the rate increases?\nBrian W. MacLean: I don't think there's any -- yes, obviously, as anybody looks at the economics of the product, the longer tail lines which would be more significantly impacted by the investment yields, that factors into how we think about it. I'm not sure it factors into how the customers think about it, so we work at it. And on the retention thing, I would go back to our comments on Slide 13. So we're obviously pleased that aggregate retention is going up, but it's really the texture underneath that we obsess about and are we keeping the right accounts. So honestly, I'm not really surprised that we've been able to execute in a way where we're keeping the best business. And...\nJay S. Fishman: And certainly -- it's Jay Fishman. And while the interest rate environment certainly plays a meaningful role in the evaluation, it is just one factor. And I'd make an observation that our Worker's Comp portfolio, broadly, and of course you can get different conclusions in different businesses, but broadly speaking, has actually been doing better. I'm not sure, Brian, how you might characterize it, better than what we perceive the rest of the industry to be or it just hasn't been -- it hasn't been in a situation where the rate need there has been enormous. I'm not sure how to exactly characterize it. But we're starting from -- we're starting from a position in Worker's Comp that was not as problematic as, I think, sort of conventional wisdom might have thought.\nBrian W. MacLean: Well, you can look at our line results for a good number of years, and our performance in Worker's Comp has been significantly better than the industry. We think that's due to a lot of things. Risk selection. We think our claim model around medical management is the best in the business and all that stuff really matters.\nJay S. Fishman: Well, Gabby hosted an Analyst Day where there was a considerable amount of time spent in the nuts and bolts of Worker's Compensation management. And really, I think demonstrated clearly, or at least attempted to demonstrate clearly, the real competitive advantages that we bring to the Worker's Compensation line. So again, it's not that we're -- we are just not all in the same situation or the same environment. And so I'd resist the temptation to just leap to the conclusion that long really needs help and short doesn't. It's just more -- unfortunately, more complicated than that.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And I agree that you guys did demonstrate very well that you have guys have a best-in-class Worker's Comp business at Travelers at the Investor Day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: You guys have done a great job of taking rates pretty significantly. Just curious what you're seeing so far in the fourth quarter? And the reason I asked is because, you've taken rate starting fourth quarter of last year. So I just wanted to see if you're successful in getting significant rate on rate.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, Vinay, this is Brian. Let me take a shot and I'll start with, we say it all the time, but we're not prognosticators here. We're not going to guess at what's going to happen in the future. I'd point to 2 things. Number one is what we saw in the third quarter, we were encouraged by. So the results that we were able to post, the texture underneath the results, and the dynamic and the feedback that we've gotten from our agents and our customers. Anecdotally, as we look at what we're working on in the fourth quarter, because we've obviously got some view of that but it's anecdotal, is similarly encouraging. So we continue to see a little bit of progress here. And at the end of the day, whether it will be up a little or down a little, we don't know. But the anecdotes right now feel pretty good. But we're also real cautious. The world can change in 30 days, and we'll see where we are at the end of the next quarter. But that's our mood right now.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay, fair enough. The second question is, how much of a benefit that you guys get from low non-cat weather? I think you mentioned that it was slightly below normal this quarter.\nJay S. Benet: This is Jay Benet. I think, when you take a look at what's taking place in Business Insurance as an example, you see a very strong increase -- I'm sorry, increase in profitability, decrease in the combined ratio. And it's difficult to split out the components on an exact basis, but I would say this, at least, a couple of points in there, where favorable non-cat weather has influenced us. And I think, if you go over to PI, you've got the same kind of result. I don't know if it's couple of points or not, but certainly working its way through and seeing some heads nodding around the table. So I think, a couple of points is probably right.\nJay S. Fishman: But it's a very -- it's truly a guesstimate because you're asking us to compare a level with whatever we thought normal might have been. And I don't know that we know normal compared to anybody else. So it's a challenging question to answer. And again, because you're asking for what was your experience relative to what you thought the experience would be, I don't know if what we thought was the right number to begin with. So that's the complexity.\nBrian W. MacLean: Vinay, let me -- it's Brian, let me give you a perspective at what you might be looking for, which is the margin expansion in BI, we think, was about 2.5 points of the combined ratio. So the price over the earned rate over the loss trend dynamics. So -- then the rest has got non-cat weather, it's got other stuff that always -- large loss movement that goes through the quarter, et cetera.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford & Bernstein.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So in the Q, you seem to be guiding to -- for a continued pricing in the fourth quarter in 2013, and I'm trying not to be redundant in the last question. But we're all trying to figure out how pricing -- how long pricing lasts. And I'm wondering, 2 questions -- well, I'll ask them first and you guys can respond as 1Q. First, when you're actuaries do indication analysis, how much more -- what's the output of that? How much more rate do you think you actually need to get to target accident year, sort of ROEs and target accident year returns? And then separately, Brian, I'd love to just follow up, you made the point about sort of visibility to a pipeline, obviously, you have the sense of what's going on in sort of actual production that you haven't yet reported. But you also obviously have to file rate increases and -- across probably what, 30% or 40% of your business, at least, where that's primarily sort of driving the rates you end up charging. And I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of actually what's in the pipeline and what you think you'll be effective in written rate levels in the fourth quarter or '13 as we look forward.\nJay S. Fishman: Josh, it's Jay Fishman, I'll take the first part of your question. We have not set a goal, a threshold number at which we stop. And it's driven by the fact that the environment remains really unpredictable and somewhat volatile. Not only do you have the weather dynamic, and obviously the interest rates which are -- at least, the interest rate portion is quantifiable. But you've also got the uncertainty of the fiscal cliff and what happens to the economy and all the factors around it. So for the moment, what we've decided to do is to continue to business it -- continue on business as usual, continue to pursue what we're doing because we know that to produce the kind of returns I think investors will come to expect, we need to do more. So that's honestly, as far as we've gone, which is we're going to continue to do this and we'll see how we do. And I have no idea what the competitive environment will be or what will happen to us. It is nonetheless a very competitive environment and remains fragmented. All we can do is tell you what we're intending to do for the next -- for the near-term outlook. I don't even want to go beyond that. All I want to do is to say in the near term, this is what we're going to do and we'll evaluate how successful we are and do the data and analytics continue to show us that we're doing the right things and on the right track. And we just don't have that goal line to say, we're X months away from hitting it. It's just -- we just don't have it, and that's really all we can say on it is business as usual, and we're going to keep going.\nBrian W. MacLean: On the filings perspective, you could -- someone could go and pull them. I would say on the personal line side, we don't have any real big filings in the works that are going to change where we are today. So we took a pretty good bump up in Auto and that was because some things kicked in, in different states and so a little bit of steady as she goes there. In Select, we've recently put in some filings, which are just becoming effective. And so we've got some momentum maybe there, and those would be the 2 big places where we've got filed rates.\nJay S. Fishman: Where filings matter. In Commercial Accounts, really it's not a file environment, we're really doing -- wrestling with that. And I'll just kind of revert back to Brian's comment about the anecdotal observations. It's still pretty early in the quarter. And so what we're getting is feedback from our folks in the field who are in agents' offices every day, renewing accounts and having conversations and getting a sense of what the market is. And the anecdotal feedback -- and I wouldn't overemphasize it because it's -- it can change. First of all, it might not be right, it might not be accurate of the real environment and it might change. But the anecdotal feedback that we're getting is -- continues to be so far, so good. And so it's encouraging and gives us a basis for saying, we're going to continue. That's -- it's about as good as we can do right now for you.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So Jay, not -- just to paraphrase, make sure I get it. So basically looking out over your guys' planning horizon, you're not going to give a target, of course. But ultimately, you're going to march to your own drummer, raise pricing, sort of get to continued levels and the market's going to what the market's going to do, but you're going to drive to sort of continued pricing momentum along the lines you've been doing thus far in 2012.\nJay S. Fishman: Well, what I'm -- what we don't want to do is to tell you that with certainty that we're going to succeed because I don't know. It's just -- it's been environment where every company decides its own strategies and has its own conversations with agents and brokers about individual accounts. So all I can tell you with some degree of certainty is in the near-term how we're going to act. That I can tell you because we drive that. How the market responds and how competitors perceive the marketplace and what they do is well beyond our control. The data that we have from the third quarter is encouraging that we're not hitting some wall. The important thing -- the question that I asked definitely here is, are we achieving what we're trying to achieve in the market? A lot of your -- not your questions, particularly, but many of the questions that we get seem to be, are we asking for 20 and getting 8? Or are we asking for 8 and getting 8? And that actually is a relevant question and it really -- we're not trying to get 20. We're not attempting. We've always said from the beginning of this that it was going to be disciplined, thoughtful, account by account, loss driven, evaluated in the context of interest rate changes, thinking about weather, and most importantly, nondisruptive, nondisruptive to our agents and our brokers and our insureds. We're trying to manage a business and relationships. This is not a trading account. It's real people with real businesses, paying real bills and real agents that stand between us, and we're just trying to manage this thoughtfully, gently, doing what we need to do to make sure our business remains viable and has substance to it, but not doing it in the way that causes disruption. So again, I look back at the third quarter, the data all says we're making that happen and gives us a basis for saying, let's keep going.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I guess, one question I have is when you look at your profitability and kind of what you've talked about from here, what do you think is more important or how would you kind of prioritize the rate actions you're taking versus the actions you seem to be taking on the loss management side? And where do you think the industry is on those measures, whether it's terms and conditions or infrastructure to help kind of push down claim cost? And just one follow-up.\nJay S. Fishman: Brian and I are going to split this. I think if you looked at Business Insurance, our strategy is predominantly rate driven. We've always been a company that's been actively engaged, helping our insureds manage and lower their losses. We have a substantial risk management group. They are involved and always have been with our insureds to try and help them manage their losses and do better business for them. So that's -- our dynamic in Business Insurance really price driven, rate driven. In Personal Insurance, underwriting terms and conditions play a much more significant role, and I'm going to let Brian speak to that.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, I mean, and I'd say clearly, personal line heavily on the Homeowners side. And to some degree, more broadly property all around. But the place where terms and conditions are really important is our Homeowners' book. And just to give you a perspective. Industry deductibles in the '70s were typical average $250, maybe a $500 deductible. Now the average is probably a $500 deductible. If we just kind of loss inflate that over the 40 years, we think the average deductible should be somewhere around $2,000. So the product has changed. So we're driving deductibles. We've actually been pretty successful historically in getting deductibles on the coastal hurricane exposed, so that's not the issue. The issue has been the inland tornado, hail exposed and we're making real progress. And so there, that's important. The other dynamic is underwriting, and a lot of that is around roofs. So age and quality of rood is an important underwriting decision now on time reporting, on claims and is different in the policy in a lot of places than it was before. So all of those pieces really matter on the property side.\nJay S. Fishman: And our hope in deductibles, by the way, is not unique to loss mitigation, that's an important part of it. But we also believe that customers shouldn't be buying more insurance than they need, right? Insurance should be to protect for catastrophic events. And we would encourage all insureds to not pay for more insurance than their own capacity to deal with losses would suggest. And so part of this is not, again, not just loss mitigation important, but it's also to make sure that we're doing the right things for our customers even if they don't always see it exactly that way. It's a $500 deductible today becomes a policy that responds to a lost iPad, and it just isn't the way a homeowners policy was really designed to be.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. And just one question on the directors. I know we haven't talked about it a lot recently. But I mean, it seems they kind of be floating along in terms of premiums are growing a little bit, the drag on, the combined ratio is about flat, looks like 5% to 7% of earnings right now. And what is the strategy there? I mean, it's -- you've kind of been in this state for a little while. At some point, would you look at trying to get -- purchase something to help kind of build that platform? Or is it -- or is building it still kind of the expectation?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, we have been and continue to be in the test-and-learn phase. It's -- and I don't mean test. What I'm talking about is testing in the very specific dynamics of building the business, whether it's how you get customers to respond or how you encourage a high conversion rate from response to quote. And then most importantly, how do you generate sales from quotes, and that gets to not only the technology or interactive behavior at a call center, but also to the pricing structure. And so we're still in the phase of doing what we need to do to gain the learnings necessary to launch, in effect, sometime down the road a successful business. This is not yet launched. We are still in the test-and-learn arena and we have more work to do in that regard. We're going to resist the temptation. We've done it -- I've certainly in the old, old Travelers days, have been involved into one where we launched a program way too early and had a marketing success and a financial disappointment. And that's a real problem. And so we're going to resist the temptation to do this early. There are always young customers coming along. There's -- it's not as if there's a finite group of customers and they're there. And once they have insurance, they're gone. We all get a day older every day, and there's always another group of customers that are emerging, that are getting drivers licenses that become young adults that need to buy insurance. And so as we think about it that way, we're more than willing to be patient and do it right. More important to do it right than to do it quick and fix as we go. So that's where we are.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And to the timeline from here is just kind of as it develops. And do you feel like you're getting the learnings from it to kind of offset the cost that you're investing in it? And I'll stop.\nJay S. Fishman: Well, we're certainly learning whether it offsets the cost or not ultimately depends upon whether we conclude that we have the ability to launch a successful business. I mean if you're asking, do we think that, that's still -- are we still on track to do that? The answer is, yes, but nothing is ever certain. And the real question that we're down to now, as we've said this repeatedly, we are charging the same price in our direct channel that we charge in our agent channel because it is the only price that we know. And the real question is going to be, in that kind of framework, can we actually write a policy, underwrite a risk and produce a reasonable return based on that, whereas, there's some other pricing structure that's going to be necessary? And it's going to take us some time to figure that one out. If we end up concluding that we have everything that's necessary to build a business, yes, we will recover these costs. If it turns out that we ultimately conclude we can't, then unfortunately, we won't. So the substance of your question is, is a challenge to answer, but I -- but we still feel pretty good here. The people working on it are first-rate people. They -- one of the things, and I've said this before, I used to think this was an insurance business. It actually is a lot more about human dynamics and technology management than it is about insurance. And it took a little time for us to even understand that. I think we've got people from outside the insurance industry with real expertise in this arena, and we are learning a lot, really a lot, and we're hopeful is sort of where it stands.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I wanted to touch base on 2 items. The first is the exposure growth in Business Insurance. Based on what you sort of see as the forward-looking indicators, to what extent might that pick up over time?\nJay S. Fishman: We're looking at each other here trying to figure out what do we know in the data and what do we see. It's -- first, one of the things we have learned is that notwithstanding the fact that intuitively, we keep thinking that the exposure data is going to turn out to be predictive of the overall economy, and we've spent some time trying to actually link those up and in effect, build an index around it. It's just not nearly as predictive as we might hope. If you look at the data broadly, I think what you would characterize it as is sluggish growth. Now those are words against some numbers, but that's kind of what we see. Now it's -- we should be careful not to confuse the dynamics that we measure in exposure to GDP. We're measuring payroll, we're measuring projected sales, we're measuring trucks on the road, we're measuring real estate square feet. And as we all know, you can have recoveries that have -- jobless recoveries, not my words, words other people have used. And so our data suggests sluggish is what you'd see, but I'd be careful to link that up to a conclusion about GDP. It's not nearly as predictive as we might have hoped.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. Next issue, on the return of capital. I think in the past, Travelers has talked about returning, in terms of the combined share buyback and shareholder dividend, having that equal to around 100% of operating income. And I think, on track year-to-date, it's around 75%. So based on the commentary that, that will probably be higher in 4Q versus 3Q, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you feel confident that could get closer to 100% as we think about next year.\nJay S. Benet: Jay, this is Jay Benet. As we said, we do these things based upon expectations. And thankfully, we have a good problem that our earnings were stronger than our expectations, so we created excess capital. So it really is a matter of timing as to when we repurchase shares. The expectation, as we said, for the fourth quarter is to do something higher than what we've been doing on a run-rate basis for the first 3 quarters. And as we say in our disclosures, there's lots of things that go into that decision. There's capital that we need to support the growth of the business. There's capital that we perhaps need or cash that we need to deal with what's taking place in the funding of our pension plans. I might add that we don't have a very large outstanding pension plan given the history of the company. But when you have interest rates as low as we have today, we want to make sure that the thing is properly funded against the assets. So we'll look in all of that, but at this point, what we could say is that we have created the excess capital beyond what we need at this stage and we haven't bought it back at the same rate, so we will be increasing it. And over time, which I think is really the critical phrase, over time, it will be the earnings that will drive the amount of capital that we return to shareholders, both in the form of dividends, as well as the share repurchases.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: All right. And I just want to clarify a prior response. I think there was a question about pace of rate increases in BI in 4Q. Now you were saying roughly similar to 3Q, and I just want to clarify that, that using the 7.8% rate increase that was in 3Q is sort of the baseline.\nJay S. Fishman: No, no. You've misheard that, I'm afraid. We were asked the question and we said, we don't make predictions and we're certainly not prognosticating on rate gains. What I think Brian said was that the anecdotal feedback and that's all it is, it's not data, it's just anecdotal feedback just suggests so far that the fourth quarter is, so far, is sort of looking the same way the third quarter did. Don't over read that. There's no precision in that comment other than conversation. That's all it is. But if we had heard from people out in the field that something substantive had changed, that there'd been some meaningful difference in the environment, that I think is important. We've not heard that. We just heard, yes, it's about the same. Now it's going to be a matter of what accounts actually come up for renewal, what's the mix, where on that grid do they fall, what lines of business. So no predictions whatsoever. And all we were doing there was providing the anecdotal feedback that fourth quarter is sort of so far, so good. Bill is -- I'm looking at Bill and asking him to nod, yes, and he did. So that's where we are.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: One clarifying question was just, I think, it was Brian who said about 250 basis points of kind of core margin improvement year-on-year. And obviously, the last quarter had a bunch of non-cat weather and large losses in it. But I guess, what I was trying to get a sense of was, how was non-cat weather, large loss activity in the current quarter relative to normal? Was that a benefit or not? And if it was, any numbers you could put to it?\nBrian W. MacLean: I'm trying to -- so 6% -- if I look at the quarter-to-quarter combined ratio in Business Insurance was improved 6% CapEx, ex-cat, ex-PYD, about 2.5% of that was the earned rate over the loss trend. The next largest piece would have been the non-cat weather which was clearly better, and then we'd had large losses, I think that's the right sequence. I don't have the exact numbers on each of those pieces, but...\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I'm sorry, I think I confused the issue. I understand on a year-over-year basis why the non-cat weather and the large property is a such a big contributor. I guess, I was -- if you look at 3Q of this year, individually, would you characterize non-cat weather and large loss activity as kind of a nonfactor in kind of the way the underlying margin played out? Or was there any benefit to speak of? Because you've mentioned in the press release, but I wasn't quite sure if that was just with respect to the year-over-year or there was something -- it was just a reversal of that a year ago or if it actually was also good this quarter.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, the bigger impact was the reversal of bad from a year ago with regard to non-cat weather activity. But as it relates to the current quarter, the current quarter also was very light in weather, whether it was cat or non-cat. So we did have a benefit in the current quarter from what we would otherwise consider to be normal. And as Jay Fishman said before, the consideration on normal has lots and lots of judgment in it. So we're not going to sit here and say, well, it was worth 1 point, 0.5 point or 1 point. But what we can tell you is that the weather was benign in the third quarter and our results benefited from that.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then one question just on the construction surety, volumes are in decline. I was curious if you could get a sense -- give us a sense of how much of that is coming from commercial end markets versus residential end markets? And is there anything you see kind of as you look out that potentially could start to dampen that trend?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, this is Brian. I'll flip it to Alan. But we don't do a lot of residential. So...\nAlan D. Schnitzer: It's way more driven by municipal finance and municipal construction, so not very much of it would be coming from the residential side.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, but I would assume that...\nJay S. Fishman: Well, we're not active in that market. Our data is largely driven by the municipal arena but it's not because, it's not the -- we don't know what's happening in the residential segment, we're just not a real participant.\nAlan D. Schnitzer: But way more of the surety market relates to municipal construction projects where there is a statutory requirement for the surety product. So you don't have the same requirement or the same level of surety premium coming out of residential construction generally.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Well, I guess, kind of as a pass-through though to the municipal piece, there's always part of that is extending services into new areas, correct? So I guess on -- I'm just -- that was kind of what I was thinking -- asking the question was kind of what I had in mind, completely recognize the comment.\nAlan D. Schnitzer: The infrastructure buildings, roads and other utilities to service, development broadly. But I certainly don't have at my fingertips have the breakout between that and say highway construction. I wouldn't have that breakout.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just wanted to -- the one disconnect that I'm sort of wrestling with is the top line, in other words, premiums written and earned premiums. The percentage gains year-over-year are just not even close to where rates are at, and retentions look good. So it seems to be coming down to new business. So my first question, I guess, is it new business falloff that's sort of driving the lack of flow through, the actual reported top line? And if it is, I'm sort of wondering why do you think people are choosing not to join Travelers as much as they were before?\nBrian W. MacLean: So the short answer is, yes, it is primarily new business. As you pointed out, retentions are down slightly in most of our businesses, but very solid and we feel great about those. We're getting price increases.\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, down slightly from historical norms.\nBrian W. MacLean: From historical norms, right. And actually across Business Insurance, for example, the overall retention, on a historical basis, a very strong number. Premium is up because we've got price exposure and audit premiums kicking through there. But across much of our Business Insurance area and clearly in personal lines, as we've executed on our strategy of improving margins and raising prices, the new business marketplace has become more difficult. And...\nJay S. Fishman: I think I'd separate the discussion into Commercial and Personal, because I'm not sure they're nearly as similar to that. But first, just an observation business, low exposure is a part of this 2, low exposure growth. That's talking about the overall, general economy. In Business Insurance, there is a phenomena that's been interesting to us. We have historically tracked a relationship between renewal pricing and new pricing. And in this quarter but also in the second, the spread between for us -- I'm not speaking about a broad market comment here, I'm only speaking about us. The spread between renewal and new that we booked actually narrowed, meaning it was better than historical standards would be. So in the context of the new business that we're taking on, we feel pretty good about it. If there's an opportunity here, if there is, it's making sure that our folks who are working so hard and focused on renewal -- renewal retention and gaining rate, don't ignore the new business opportunity. I don't believe, Greg, and I can't prove it to you, but I don't believe that it's people not choosing, as your words, not choosing to be with Travelers. I think if anything here, it's making sure that our folks have the energy as they go through the renewal process to make sure that they don't miss the opportunities in new that at these pricing levels any way are increasingly attractive. And we are focused on that and suspect that -- if you talk to an underwriter, they will tell you that renewing an account flat in a flat environment is pretty quick and pretty easy. But if you're discussing a rate increase with a broker or an agent on an individual account, it just takes more time. A lot of accounts and a lot more time being absorbed in the renewal arena, and we believe -- can't prove it to you, that we believe that this is mostly an issue of emphasis and effort and attention more than it is some substantive dynamic around new business that's in any way problematic. Can't prove it, but that's what we believe sitting around the table. In the Personal Insurance arena, we think it's different. There, the combination of -- particularly in homeowners, but also in auto, the combination of rate and then in homeowners the change in the deductible strategies that Brian has spoken about has -- we're most certainly leading. Again, that's our observation. We are leading in the market, but responding to what we think are substantive issues, the change in the weather, the other dynamics around it. And for the moment, there are alternatives, there are other companies that are available to new customers that may, in fact, be looking like they are less expensive. You get into the whole deductible dynamic and how much you pay for it. So on the Personal Insurance front, we're watching that carefully. It's almost -- personal, it's almost like where we were in Commercial a year ago, which is we were moving ahead and we were hopeful that we would be able to be successful with the strategy, turned out of course, at least, so far that we have been. In Business Insurance, you've seen -- I'm sorry, in Personal Insurance, you've seen the rate gains come on particularly in the last 2 quarters as the filings have taken hold, and combined with the underwriting and deductible dynamics, we're watching it carefully and seeing if it will be successful in the new arena, but only time will really tell. I hope that's helpful, and it's really a fulsome answer as we can provide.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Yes, that is. And just a quick follow-up then. Turning just to the business side. It sounds like that's a prioritization or a point of emphasis within the organization, deciding in a new business versus retention. I mean, my understanding is a point of retention is -- has a far, far better payback within your P&L than new business. Do the people within your organization get paid sort of the same for retention versus new business? Or in other words, are they agnostic or are they actually pursuing what is -- where the highest payback is in the Travelers' P&L, which is go get rate on the current book?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, we can tell you how they're compensated. I hope that they're reacting consistent with it, but of course, you never know. We don't pay for production, we don't pay for new, we don't pay for renewal, we pay for an overall evaluation of performance, not only at an individual office level but actually right down to an individual underwriter level. The data analytics package, I spoke about earlier, really makes it possible for us to have a very granular conversation with each of the frontline people about how they've done. What you can't do is tell people that you really want to improve profitability, and when they take the right steps, even if that means that they lose an account, that you somehow think that's a bad thing. You have to embrace it and understand that it's a good thing. So the numbers, in and of themselves, of production, if you pay based to that, you can get some, not only unintended consequences, but frankly, it will make it difficult to employ the strategies that you know are right to improve profitability. So our payment process is one of -- let's evaluate what each of them has done in the past 12 months as everybody else in this place is evaluated, and we make the payments accordingly. I do think that -- it is hard being a field person right now. They are juggling lots of accounts, negotiating renewals, driving for rate, having to do the analytics behind all that to make sure that the selections they make are thoughtful and smart. And then you tell them, and by the way, don't forget to make sure that you're following up on new business opportunities. I do believe -- yes, and I can't prove it, but I do believe that it is a matter of emphasis and time management far more than it is pricing out of the marketplace. I have no indication that, that's the case or that there's some substantive dynamic of customers choosing away from us. I don't believe that either.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session.

Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Given the active weather pattern we saw in the second quarter, we're pleased to report solid performance driven by continued strong underwriting results and investment income. In the quarter, we produced net income of $499 million or $1.26 per diluted share, including $357 million of after-tax catastrophe losses or $0.90 per diluted share. Year-to-date return on equity is now at 10.5%, and operating return on equity is nearly 12%. The weather losses in the quarter, though much improved from last year's extraordinary $1.1 billion level, are still much higher than historical experience would suggest. It was not too many years ago that $357 million in after-tax cat losses is what we would have expected for a full year. Today, weather events and their impact on local communities and our policy holders seem to be a constant news headline. In this quarter alone, there were tornadoes across the Midwest, wildfires in Colorado, there were hailstorms in Texas and most recently, violent thunder and windstorms across the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic. Brian will discuss our cat losses with you in more detail. But once again, I want to extend my personal and professional thanks to our 13,000-person-strong claim organization who continue to be called upon to do extraordinary work in difficult circumstances and they continue to make all of us very proud. I just want to say thanks. The continued high level of weather losses, along with the continuing decline in interest rates, validates our strategy to drive improved rate, terms and conditions and therefore lift underwriting results. That strategy is on course and is now very much visible in our earnings. Net income, excluding catastrophe losses, net favorable prior-year development, improved an impressive 16% from the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by higher earned pricing. In the quarter, we were again successful in achieving rate gains across all of our business segments. The Business Insurance rate increased over 7%, and Personal Insurance renewal prices increased in both Auto and Homeowners by 6% and 11%, respectively. And in FP&II, rates increased in both our Management Liability businesses and our International businesses, 5% and 4%, respectively. This is all positive and importantly, as Brian will demonstrate, we are leveraging our analytics to realize improved profitability by achieving rate in a targeted fashion where it is needed. And one more topic to cover before I turn it over to Jay. We spent a lot of time thinking about the appropriateness of our financial objective of achieving a mid-teens operating return on equity over time, particularly in the light of the continuing decline in interest rates, as well as the possibility that weather patterns may be different from historical trends. As it relates to interest rates, we observed that the 10-year treasury is now at 1.5%. We thought it was low when just a year ago, it was just under 3%. And as for weather, one only has to look at the experience of the last couple of years, to understand that mother nature is having her own say about weather patterns. On the positive side, we've been successful in achieving significant rate increases and have taken underwriting steps, which when combined with the rate gains, are already producing meaningful improvements and profitability. We are committed to continuing to take these steps. On a historical perspective, our over-time returns on equity have been amongst the best in the industry, particularly over the last 7.5 years. However, we have said previously that achieving a mid-teens ROE is not currently achievable in the short-term. To be clear, that means right now and likely through the immediate future. However, we continued to embrace our long-term financial objective as an aspirational goal. And in that regard, we will continue to take the steps necessary to meet that goal as it is stated over time. We are very pleased with the profitability improvements we have already achieved and, based on written rate gains and our expectations of loss trends, are likely to continue to achieve at least over the near-term. Our entire organization embraces this goal and it is embedded in the DNA of this place more deeply than most would suspect. Consequently, we continue to direct our underwriters to continue to move forward and also with the -- I'm sorry, we continue to direct our underwriters to continue to move forward. We will do so selectively with the goal of not disrupting our agents, brokers and customers, but also with the goal of producing superior returns over time. If and when we become convinced that the environment will no longer allow us to achieve this goal, again, over time, we will change it. But for now, we remain committed. To sum up, this was a very good quarter that was unfortunately impacted by elevated weather losses. The underwriting and pricing actions we've been taking in our businesses are consistent with our strategy of generating superior returns. We are very pleased with our progress and momentum to-date. And we will keep moving forward. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks, Jay. Looking beyond cat losses, I would characterize our second quarter results as strong. As Jay already indicated, underlying underwriting results showed margin improvement in each segment, including expanding margins in Business Insurance, and we continue to see our reserves develop favorably. As for investment results, non-fixed income investment returns were strong this quarter, driven by private equities in real estate, while fixed income investment returns were in line with our expectations, given the low interest rate environment. Other items to note: First, we reduced our debt-to-capital ratio in the quarter as we used holding company cash to repay $250 million of maturing debt. The debt-to-total capital ratio now stands at 22.3%, down from 23.1% at the beginning of the quarter. Second, we modified our cat coverage by modestly reducing our General Cat Treaty and increasing our Northeast coverage. Effective July 1, maximum recovery under our Gen Cat Treaty was reduced to $400 million from $525 million and the attachment point was increased to $1.5 billion. Also effective July 1, we renewed our $600 million Northeast Gen Cat Treaty with the same $2.25 billion attachment point as in the prior-year. And finally, effective June 6, we entered into a 3-year reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re III, a newly formed entity that issued $250 million of cat bonds, providing us with Northeast hurricane coverage on specified lines of business, which is subject to a $2 billion retention. After which, we can recover 50% of covered losses up to $250 million. All of this was accomplished at a cost that was effectively the same as in the prior year. For your convenience, we've shown the structure of our cat coverage on Page 21 of the webcast and a complete description is included on our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today. And finally, all of our financial strength indicators remain in excellent shape. Given seasonal cash flow patterns and recent cat losses, second quarter operating cash flows remain strong at $451 million, a holding company liquidity of $1.98 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their targeted levels at the end of the quarter. Net unrealized investment gains, which ended the quarter at $4.57 billion before tax, increased by over $200 million in the quarter, and book value per share rose to $64.90, 4% higher than the beginning of the year and 9% higher than a year ago. And as always, we remain fully committed to identifying and returning excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned a little over $530 million to our shareholders, with common stock repurchases of $350 million and dividends of $181 million. Brian is now going to talk about our underwriting results.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Before I get into the segment results, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the impact of catastrophes in the quarter. In total, there were 13 industry cats, 7 of which were significant for us. While our cat losses this quarter were much lower than the unprecedented levels of 2011, they were considerably higher than what we would've expected based on long-term historical experience. Although thankfully, we didn't have the headline-grabbing events of last year, to put all this into perspective the application of state market shares to our catastrophe losses and estimates reported by competitors would imply an industry loss over $10 billion. At this level, but for last year's results, this would have been the worst second quarter for weather losses in history. Particularly in light of the significant and unpredictable impact of weather, we remain very pleased with the performance of the franchise, particularly the underlying margin improvement that we are seeing across our businesses. Beginning with Business Insurance. Operating income excluding cats in prior year development is $488 million, up more than 9% from the prior-year quarter. On the same basis, the combined ratio improved nearly 3 points year-over-year, driven largely by earned rate increases exceeding loss cost trends, along with fewer large losses. Net written premiums were up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong pricing gains, as well as by growth in exposures and audit premiums. Retention remained solid and was in line with the first quarter at 79%, while new business of $451 million was down from the prior-year quarter but up from the recent quarters. Renewal premium change for the quarter was 9 points, which included pure rate of 7%. You can see on Slide 10 that although this looks like a drop of a full point in rate from last quarter, the more precise numbers show that we went from rate increases of 7.5% last quarter to 7.4% this quarter. So essentially, unchanged in the aggregate. The rate increases continued to be broad-based with all product lines between 7 and 9 points, with workers comp and auto still at the top of that range. With the 7.4% average price increase and given our current view of loss trend, which remained at about 4%, we continued to significantly expand written margins in the quarter. For over the last 6 months, we're encouraged that we've been able to achieve real margin improvement while at the same time delivering solid retention and new business volumes. I want to emphasize, as I did last quarter, that to really understand how good the results are, they need to be analyzed at a granular level. On Slide 14, we have updated with second quarter data a summarized example of how we approach this. The slide shows our rate change and retention data for Commercial Accounts, segmented by the individual account's long-term loss ratio. The bar on the left represents our best performing business, accounts with a long-term loss ratio of less than 60%, and the bar on the right represents our worst-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%. The results show that retention is stronger for the better business and the rate changes dramatically higher on the poor performing accounts. The data is fairly consistent with last quarter, with the most significant change coming in the greater than 90% loss ratio band, where pricing increased about 1 point, while retention increased 7 points. We believe this suggests more opportunity to improve profitability prospectively. To help bring home the execution of this -- how the execution of this strategy has positively impacting profitability, consider a simple example of an account in the middle band on Slide 14. Prior to this year's rate actions, assume the account had a loss ratio of 75%. As you can see on the slide, our average rate actions in this band are 11% and assuming loss trend of 4, after the written change has fully earned in, the loss ratio on this account would improve to approximately 70%, a drop of 7% on the loss ratio in a single year. I want to emphasize a few points. First, although this data is real, it is an illustration in that the exhibit presents summarized data, and we actually measure and manage our performance on a much more granular level by individual business, product line, industry, geography, et cetera. Second, actual pricing and underwriting decisions are made by individual underwriters on an individual account basis. What you should take away from this is that a simplistic look at the aggregate rate number, without understanding this granular level -- this level of granularity does not give you a complete picture of how profitability was impacted. This is a complex process that requires a tremendous amount of data, and it is a core competency of ours. And this is why we are confident about the path we're on. Going forward, we will continue to execute our pricing strategy in this manner. And right now, we see opportunities to improve the rate and retention trade-off, especially on our least profitable business. In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, we continue to see strong results with operating income for the quarter of $182 million, an increase of 11% from the second quarter of 2011. After eliminating the effects of catastrophes in prior-year development, loss ratios have now improved for 6 consecutive quarters. This improvement is due largely to our efforts to achieve a better balance of risk and reward for attritional losses, as well as large losses and catastrophes. Turning to production in Bond & Financial Products, surety volumes were down modestly from prior year quarter and continued at a level that reflects reduced construction spending. In our Management Liability business, which comprises about 35% of the Financial, Professional & International segment, we continue to show strong premium growth in production metrics. We achieved meaningful and accelerating rate increases in this business and are encouraged that retentions remain high. Overall, a great quarter for this franchise. In Personal Insurance, weather continues to have a significant impact on our results with after-tax cats coming in at $190 million for the quarter. Excluding cats and prior-year reserve development, operating income of $164 million was up 34% from the second quarter of 2011, driven largely by elevated non-cat weather and fire losses in the prior year. Excluding these items, underlying loss results for both Auto and Home were essentially flat year-over-year. In Home, the story is all about weather volatility and the resulting need to improve margins. In Auto, there is also a weather dynamic that is not insignificant, but the bigger story is the continued pressure in losses that the industry is experiencing, particularly the increased severity trend for both physical damage and bodily injury claims that we've been addressing for several quarters. Accordingly, we continue to improve pricing in Auto, and both pricing and terms and conditions in Home. Renewal premium change in the quarter increased in both Auto and Homeowners to 6% and 11%, respectively. Given our commitment of lifting returns in this segment, we are seeing lower new business volumes as anticipated, and we are very confident in our strategy. With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Andre, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer period, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: I've been hearing you and others talk about terms and conditions changes within Homeowners. Can you update us on that initiative? Specifically, how far along in the process are we? And can you detail what the main initiatives are? I believe they're on the deductible side.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. Mike, this is Brian. Let me start. Yes, clearly, the main initiative is the deductibles. We've been pushing this -- I would say, we started about 12 months ago. We've been pushing more dramatically in the last 6 months. We've got just about 40 states now where we are pushing higher deductibles than we have historically had. And that is the main initiative. In some places -- in most places, it is heavily on the new business side of the equation. So it's not as much broadly across the renewal book although, in the more troubled areas, it's even there. We're pretty encouraged by fairly recent activity it's gotten. And there was actually an article in The Wall Street Journal online the other day about insurance deductibles soaring and talked about kind of a widespread movement to get deductibles up. So that is clearly the biggest area. Also from the underwriting and terms perspective, I think we and some other companies are looking hard about how we cover roof hail losses. And so, there's an underwriting dynamic about being more -- doing a better job of selection on the age of roof, the quality, the type of roof, et cetera. And also looking at how we could potentially be changing the coverage around covering roof losses. Those are probably the biggest areas.\nJay S. Fishman: The only thing I'd add which Brian made brief reference to but I think over time will matter is a change in our underwriting process to actually exclude homes that have roofs that are of a particular age compared to -- and it varies based upon the type of roof it is and its structure, but setting up a hard-line standard to the extent that the age of the roof exceeds x number of years or x percentage of its useful life, we won't underwrite the home at all. And I don't know how many states that's in, Brian. I don't know if you know either.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. I don't know.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: So I mean, do you -- is this -- 40 states seems like a lot, so should we -- I mean, should we expect -- I mean, in your increasing rates in Homeowners in excess of I think 8%, 9%, 10% plus you're making deductible changes, should we expect a -- is the expectation meaningful improvement down the road?\nBrian W. MacLean: I'm trying to think of what -- what exactly do you mean by meaningful?\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: In terms of the margins. It just seems like there's a lot going on there. Just more than just rate.\nJay S. Fishman: It's Jay Fishman. I think, 2 things. First, the rate side is not only new, but also renewal. And so the impact of the rate is taking effect in the book right now. What is completely unpredictable is the weather. And the weather losses are such a meaningful part of Homeowners losses that for us to speak about anticipating improvement implicitly implies an assumption about weather. And I would tell you that importantly here, the actions that we're taking on rate, we're doing fine, pleased with the retention in the Homeowners book. To the extent the change in deductibles are predominantly in new business, we anticipated and are seeing a drop-off in our new business as other competitors have not yet become -- have not changed as much as we have. But the article that Brian referenced a moment ago about soaring deductibles was interesting to us. So I'd say that yes, we feel very good about the rate actions and the renewal book, and that's looking pretty solid to us. And we will ultimately see what happens with our new business on the -- driven by the change in deductibles in those states.\nBrian W. MacLean: But you're right Mike, together, they should have a meaningful impact on margins. The big variable is what the weather's going to be.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Good, that's very helpful. And then lastly, if I look at Slide 10 on Business Insurance and the renewal rate change on 1Q, 7.5%, 2Q, 7.4%. I believe you guys have a pretty decent line, it's 30, 60 days out on pricing. Do you think you've reached an absolute [ph] Level of rate increase that we should maybe think about rates moving downward?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, so let me -- it's Brian again, Mike. Let me take a shot. And again, I'd start by reemphasizing that 7.5% rate, 9 points of price and 4 points of trend, we're getting some pretty good margin expansion at these levels. But I get your question, which is, where is it going? And I'll start with the caveats we always give. We don't have a magic crystal ball, so we're not going to make any long-term predictions. With that said, a couple of comments. We've talked for a long time that the 2 main things that are driving pricing improvement at this time are the lowering interest rates and the increased weather volatility. Certainly, nothing happened this past quarter that mitigated those 2 factors, so there's a lot of reason why there should be something sustaining it. But the thing that I'd reinforce, is to us it isn't about a magic number. Believe it or not, we do not have an aggregate target for a pure rate number that we are shooting for. We've got about a million accounts every year, so 1/12 of those coming through every quarter. And it really is a very granular -- how we approach it. No broad brush answer. And so what we really, really focus on is the execution underneath, and are we getting the right rate increases on the right accounts. Our goal is not to get higher rate. Our goal is to improve profitability. Now, we understand that in the aggregate, more rate is better than less in that venture. So it's hard for us to pinpoint exactly where. I mentioned in the distribution slide the fact that we had 1 point higher rate in our worst-performing business and 7 points higher retention suggests that there's more opportunity there. If that is in fact the case, we'll be encouraged. But we're going to execute on a very granular level.\nJay S. Fishman: I'll add just a couple of comments because I think it is so important. It really speaks to the fundamental strategy. We've got underwriters out there who are looking at all these individual accounts every day. Brian is right, almost a million business accounts over the course of the year. We've got 1 underwriter doing an evaluation of an individual account or an individual class of business and suggesting pricing. We have accounts that produce very attractive returns. We have accounts that produce much less attractive returns. How the mix actually shows up this month -- which accounts are coming due, are they weather exposed, are they less weather exposed, have they been consistent with our loss expectations, have they not been -- is really going to determine what the individual underwriter decides as it relates to that account. Though it's -- our look at 7.5% versus 7.4% is that you can't conclude much of anything from that. And I'm not even sure in the aggregate it's all that relevant. The breadth, and we've shown this before, the breadth of account of pricing changes in our account base is really quite remarkable. It goes from accounts that are getting 10% or more of rate reductions, all the way up to accounts that are getting 10% or more of rate gains. And so, it's really left to the underwriters. What we will say is that we're not hearing anything anecdotally from our field organization that would cause us to believe that continuing to improve profitability is becoming meaningfully more challenging. We ask that all the time. We're just not hearing a message back that says, \"We're beginning to find this competitively difficult.\" The feedback from the field organization is actually pretty encouraging, and it's one of the important reasons that we have confidence that we can continue to move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Walsh with Citi.\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: First question for Jay or Jay just on the non-fixed income portfolio. I read in the 10-Q, you expect income in the second half of this year to be more consistent with the second half of last year, which would have a lower after-tax yield than what you guys put up in the first half of this year. Is that driven more by how returns are reported on that asset class? Or more a statement on where those returns should be relative to current interest rates? And I've got a follow-up.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, this is Jay Benet. We don't have a crystal ball to see how the alternative investment portfolio is going to perform, but in looking at what took place during the quarter, we did have a very strong quarter with regard to private equities and real estate in particular. But I'd say in the case of private equities, it was geared more towards the first half of the quarter than the second half of the quarter. I mean, you're seeing, as well as we are, what's taking place in the economy and the -- in the markets. So in looking out at the second half of the year, we were just more or less looking at the performance of the portfolio in the second half of the second quarter and saying, things seem to be moderating a little bit from where they were in the first half of the quarter and where they were in the first quarter. So it's hard to predict, as we said. And we'll see what happens. But we're not forecasting a precipitous drop. We're just saying, take a look at the first -- the second half of last year as some indicator as to where the second half of this year might be.\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay. And then second question for Brian, and I know you've already alluded to this on Slide 14. It appears you may have some runway here on the above 90% combined ratio business to really drive rate. Maybe another way of asking this question, is there a more optimal spread in retention between your worst-performing business and your middle- or best-performing accounts? Because it seems like it's a pretty tight spread, and you can really drive a lot more rate on that worst-performing, if you could talk to that a little?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. So the thing I would emphasize, like I said in the comments, is -- so the picture we're showing there is a real summarized version of how we do this. And so as we look at it, I would say directionally, what we've seen in the last 90 days is, to exactly that point, more opportunity on the worst-performing business, whether that's combined ratio over 90 or however we measure it in different businesses. And it gets back to what Jay said is driving that. Potentially, there is a more optimal balance in the retentions there. We've got to see how account by account how that all plays out. But we're very focused on improving the profitability, specifically on those accounts, and retaining our best business at the best possible terms, conditions and price.\nJay S. Fishman: This is Jay Fishman. In some of our business, we're looking at these numbers on a decile basis, that granular. In some, we're looking at it on a quintile basis, that granular. But when you look at the page that you're looking at, this is only 1 quarter to 1 quarter and sequentially. And I'd hesitate to overreact or over-predict because you just don't know what happened in the field on so many individual accounts. But to see a lift in retention in that 90 and above on a summarized basis with only 1 point of lift in rate suggests that there's -- it'd be a useful bucket for us to focus on over the next quarter and see if we can make better -- effect more better profit improvement actions in that bucket. But it is only 1 sequential quarter to another, and I wouldn't overreact to it or overstate its significance. It's an indicator, an important indicator, but only 1.\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: And just quick follow-up, that 90% or higher combined ratio, what percent of your business is that currently?\nBrian W. MacLean: I don't have that exact number, so...\nJay S. Fishman: I don't know that we've ever disclosed it either. And it varies, by the way, by month. What comes due? That was the other part of this that is so important. That competitive perspective isn't something that we want to share. But the mix isn't the same quarter-to-quarter, which obviously affects not only the retention but also the rate gains. It keeps moving. But from a competitive standpoint, I just don't think that's something that we'd like to share.\nBrian W. MacLean: And I would just say because I think you said combined ratio, first of all, it's loss ratio. And you can look at our aggregate loss ratio, obviously, it's a relatively small percentage. Or else our aggregate loss ratio wouldn't be where it is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: I guess just staying on that discussion on Slide 14, which is obviously very helpful. If you sort of look forward, and if I understand this correctly, you're saying that the slope of the rate change line will change but the retention percentages, even if they grow, they would not continue to grow at this one-off this quarter what we saw? Is that a fair assumption? I mean that number will not continue to climb meaningfully on a retention basis.\nJay S. Fishman: First -- again, Jay Fishman. We're reluctant and not unwilling to, but reluctant to make predictions because it is so granular and it's so account by account. But broad base, you'd look at the loss ratio over 90%, and what we saw was a 1 point increase in rate from the first quarter and a meaningful increase in retention. It may be that we should have a somewhat higher rate and a even lower retention, so I don't think that we're -- in fact I'll say it definitively, we're not predicting anything. We're not predicting a change in the slope nor are we predicting a change in the retention. This is again, only 3 months on a million business accounts a year. What we're trying to do from all the data that we see is interpret behavior and then we sit down with the management with Bill Cunningham and the rest of the Business Insurance team. And we have a serious discussion about the way the strategy is being executed. And what Brian was suggesting -- what Brian said was that we look at that data and you see, we see an opportunity to do it better. What form that takes, what the relative mix of retention versus rate is not -- I don't know, I don't know. We're going to see what accounts come up next quarter. It's not the same accounts. It's a new group of accounts. With a new set of demands and a new set of attributes. But you look at what in that small section in the quarter, we say, \"Alright, there's an opportunity there to do it better and therefore improve profitability at a different pace.\" At a 90% and above loss ratio, it's hard to argue that we're making money, any serious money. I mean, this is loss ratio only. So it may be that allowing more of it to non-renew is a step in the right direction. Remember, even though it's above 90%, it goes all the way out. We have accounts that have loss ratios that are worse than 90%. So you're getting into very granular decisions about what you retain and what you don't and what rate demands you put on the book.\nBrian W. MacLean: One quick thing, if I got your question, too. Just to make sure that you don't overblow the arithmetic here by thinking that, \"Gee, the retention ratio went up a lot in that bucket and it might come back down.\" That is by far the smallest of the 3 buckets. We are also at the same time focused on the left-hand bucket of hoping to keep a little bit more. We could have retention come down significantly on the 90% and above, go up slightly on the under 60%, and the net of that might be flat retention or even increased retention. So be careful with the overanalyzing the arithmetic.\nJay S. Fishman: In its simplest form, not every account in the book returns the same. And ultimately, the analysis is, individual account or class performance, what we've already accomplished from an earned rate -- from a written rate perspective what will become earned prospectively and then what steps do we take on what comes up for renewal next month, next month, next month. We're always looking 30, 60, 90 days out. So it's not the same accounts. It's going to be a new group of accounts. And we will figure out what the best course of action is.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Yes, that's very helpful. The only other question I had is on, and maybe I missed this, on the reserve addition in -- on the environmental side. I noticed in the Q, you talk about new claim levels increasing for I guess the mid-1980s policies. Maybe just expand on that a bit. And is that just a one-off? Or is that something which is beginning to tick up?\nJay S. Benet: Yes, they're actually -- this is Jay Benet. They're actually not increasing. What we see is each year a flow of new claims coming in. And the flow has been decreasing. When we do reserving, we make estimates as to the level of decrease that we're going to see in future claim activity. And in relation to the actual flow, the actual flow has been a little higher than our assumptions have been but they have been decreasing. And given the nature of the coverage that these things relate to, a lot of these things relate to policies that were written decades ago. So that's what we're trying to communicate in the Q.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So I'd love to ask a follow-up question around severity trends. You guys mentioned helpfully, I think Brian, the 4% rate you're seeing overall. And I'm wondering if you could give us some color on your major drivelines of business? What you're seeing in terms of, if you want to sort of model rate need versus pricing you're taking? What's your best assumptions we should be using for loss trends? And then also, there's been a lot of conversation broadly within the industry around severity acceleration, lately around BI. But we'd love to see because you guys have exposure to a lot of different lines sort of what you're seeing? And if we should be thinking about the emerging issues there starting to work their way into either casualty lines or workers compensation or even some of these sort of higher layer and sort of less slip-and-fall type stuff?\nBrian W. MacLean: Let me start and take a shot and you threw a lot of stuff in there. So again, just to make sure that we're grounded, the 4% trend that we're talking about is in BI. I would say...\nGabriella Nawi: Business Insurance.\nBrian W. MacLean: Business Insurance, I'm sorry. Across the entire place, we didn't see anything dramatically changed this quarter. So whatever I'm going to say about severity trends is the same thing we've been saying for the last several quarters. In Business Insurance, we've talked to you starting, I don't know, probably a year ago now on the workers comp trends. Those have kind of leveled off but they've leveled off at a higher than traditional rate. So that's one of the places that we're continuing to watch it. Again, no deterioration this quarter, but... Auto, across both personal and commercial, are places that we are looking at. The bodily injury severity is something that is driving through the Auto results. Again, this is both personal and commercial lines. And it's really on the medical side running clearly higher than medical inflation, the medical CPI, more hospitalizations. And on the personal lines side, a significant uptick in pedestrian losses, et cetera. I don't think we're the only company talking about that. On the -- also on the Auto side, the physical damage side from a personal line, the increased value of used cars has had a significant ripple through the physical damage coverages and the cost -- repair costs and replacement and total loss valuations are up fairly dramatically. Again, those didn't tick up higher in the quarter, but they continue to run higher than normal rates that we would see. And then, we've got all the dynamics running through property, which is primarily a weather frequency issue. But those are the big drivers that we're looking at.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: That's really helpful, Brian. Within the medical -- the various medical related lines, is this sort of a economically driven sort of customer utilization of P&C insurance sort of growing? Or is it -- do you think it's something due to hospitals and medical providers maybe in a sort of a post-Obamacare in world starting to figure out how better to cost shift to the insurance industry?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. So hard to know exactly. We don't believe it is fundamentally people trying to find health coverage through our products in a fundamentally different way. On the Auto side, it appears to be driven by more serious accidents and more serious injuries. Now we could debate the causes of that and distracted driver, et cetera, distracted pedestrians across the board. And we and the industry are trying to figure those things out, but we don't believe it's fundamentally people trying to access our products for coverage in a way that they haven't historically done.\nJay S. Fishman: We do believe that this issue of distracted drivers, importantly, and distracted pedestrians crossing the street while reading a device and getting hit, having accidents. That's a real factor going on here. And how to sort it all out and figure out the implications of it, quite difficult. But we're spending a lot of time with it. Those are 2 societal trends that we believe are clearly showing up in the numbers.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: All right. That's really helpful. Jay, if I could just ask one question. You made your point -- you made a point early on about sort of a challenge of getting back to a mid-single -- mid-double-digit ROE. When you talk to your largest agents and you sort of think about sort of positioning them, is there a consensus among customers, buyers and the people who'll ultimately pay for this that, that's a realistic goal and something that the industry should be able to shoot for? Or is your comment that actually -- should we take that to be that's just probably just an unrealistic thing in this environment?\nJay S. Fishman: That's really a great and interesting question. I do speak to agents a lot. One of the things when I talk about anecdotal observations, it's not just from our own folks but it's talking to agents about their interactions with customers. Remember, we're quoting an account. It's the agent or broker who's actually having the conversation with the agent. And I -- we never really talk about returns -- agents. It's just not something that they really think about or contemplate. When I ask the really good ones what the nature of their conversation with their customers are, what I often hear is a conversation around -- that the agent tells the customer -- \"I tell the customer notwithstanding the increase, they are still paying less than they paid for coverage in 200X, whatever X is.\" So the cumulative effect of the rate declines over those last few years, notwithstanding the increases -- I hear things like, \"I tell them that they're still paying less than they paid in 2009 or in 2007.\" And that the conversation between the agent and customer is okay. I will tell you that we have not had much angst or pushback from agents or brokers. And believe me, if we were being disruptive to their business, we would hear it. There is no doubt in my mind that we would hear it. You can go back a couple of years ago when we started this and we identified as an important factor not being disruptive to agents, brokers or customers. That was step #1 for us. And so far, so good. I don't think agents -- we don't talk about returns on account. Agents know when an account has had attractive loss performance and when it's had poor loss performance. They're on top of their accounts, they know. If we execute our strategy thoughtfully and intelligently here, we're having conversations about accounts that have had worse than anticipated performance, and that's where the rubber really meets the road. And there's -- they understand and they talk to their customers and they understand. I think that's one of the reasons why we've been able to execute this as successfully as we are. It has not been one-size-fits-all approach to the pricing. It's been very account- or class-driven.\nBrian W. MacLean: The one thing I would add -- this is Brian -- is that, and completely agreeing with Jay, our agents and customers don't think about our ROEs. They do, the agents clearly and the middle market and above customers do understand the impact of investment yields on our business. And so, we can have conversations around, given the decline in the investment yields, logic would say the insurance product, the underwriting should be more profitable. They understand that dynamic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: I guess the first question would be, I think in aggregate, most people's view of reserves right now is that they're still [ph] generally redundant, but I think -- I also think that some of the recent accident years is where there are some current concern to. So given we're still seeing some pretty significant favorable numbers coming out of your book, just be curious if just how the 2010, 2011 accident years are performing within the context of that?\nJay S. Fishman: Yes. This is Jay Benet. In the quarter, we didn't see any movement of any magnitude associated with the 2010, 2011 accident years other than what we talked about in the releases. Some of the cat losses that we had put up last year developed a little favorably. But at this point in time, as we've said before, whatever we are seeing in terms of loss trends and claim activity, we're building into our loss specs, we're building into our reserves, we stay very current in that in a quarter-by-quarter basis, and nothing new has come up in the quarter.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay. Any -- and how about -- would 1Q be the same comment?\nJay S. Benet: I think in the first quarter, we talked about some development that had taken place in the 2011 accident year. Part of it is -- as we refine our calculations about particular years, there are some -- I don't know I'd call it almost arithmetic or administrative adjustments that we make. But there was nothing alarming, nothing causing us to shift the view as to profitability associated with a particular type of product.\nJay S. Fishman: We did last year strengthen 2010.\nJay S. Benet: Last year, yes.\nJay S. Fishman: Just to reaffirm that. So in 2011, we did take actions to strengthen the 2010 year. And I think in the aggregate that 2010 last year in the aggregate did develop negatively. We don't know that there was any other year that in the aggregate has developed that way prior to '10?\nJay S. Benet: No.\nBrian W. MacLean: No.\nJay S. Fishman: And what Jay is really saying...\nJay S. Benet: And year-to-date 2010, we haven't made any...\nJay S. Fishman: Any adjustments. So the changes that we made last year for 2010 continue to look okay.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: That's fair. That's right. That's in part why I was asking the question. The other -- I guess and Jay, Brian, I don't know which of you wants to go first on this, but can you just maybe talk about kind of the nature of the competition you're seeing right now? And I guess, there have been some broker comments about regionals generally being more price-friendly than maybe some of the national carries. I don't know if that necessarily is really all that different from what we normally hear. But I guess part of the reason I'm asking that question is when we go back to the cohorts you show, the fact that you've got maybe more rate opportunity vis-a-vis retention in that last cohort, is that all that unusual relative to what you'd expect to see in an environment where prices are probably moving up? Or is that -- or do you think in your minds that's actually somewhat unique?\nBrian W. MacLean: No. So part of our hesitancy here is well, we obviously don't have perfect transparency into what our competitors are doing. We -- I would say, to your point, not fundamentally different. Your comments about how regional companies are acting relative to national companies, I would say is by and large the normal environment and that seems to continue. I think...\nJay S. Fishman: By that, I mean, because we're -- I would say that we don't feel out of pattern. I'm putting -- I'm seeing if those are words that fit your instincts, right?\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes. And I think that's a great way to phrase it.\nJay S. Fishman: We don't feel out of pattern, broadly speaking. Every account always stands up on its own. And there is individual discussions about an individual account. Most of them are okay, sometimes they're not, sometimes there are issues or problems or a history. But conversations are unique to the individual account. But we don't feel out of pattern. We don't hear anything anecdotally that suggests that we're out of whack here.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And then the cohort, too, just kind of maybe having more opportunity to push rate. And that last cohort, is that kind of within the pattern as well?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, yes. We'd say it's not unusual.\nJay S. Fishman: Underwriters don't like to lose accounts. They are sales people. They are thoughtful, technical, smart sales people, but they're sales people. And they don't particularly like to lose accounts. So part of the process here is to cause them to feel secure that our goal is to improve profitability. Volume will be what it will be as long as we are in the broad framework, moving down the road to improved profitability. And importantly, culturally, here, you won't hear criticism from senior folks about an account that was lost. If an account wasn't renewed, it's just fine as long as the process behind it was thoughtful and engaged the agent and was reasonably done. And so it's not unusual in that -- in those more difficult cohorts as you describe it. It's just a little more challenging to get underwriters to feel that confident about that group as they do about any other group of accounts that they're working on.\nJay S. Benet: And this is Jay Benet again. I just wanted to just add something to what I said about reserves. Gabby reminds me that we did say in the first quarter, as it related to the 2011 accident year, we did strengthen commercial Auto a little bit. That would be the one place that's...\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: The first question is again once again on Slide #14. Just wondering how those bars have shifted in the sense that, have you achieved greater profitability on the 60% to 90% and more than 90% loss ratios? And is that the reason why pricing is flattening because less of the accounts are performing badly?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, that's actually -- it's a good question. We -- because we talk about that actually right here, is there -- does there come a time where the returns in the business are such that we're simply not seeking that kind of rate increase that we might have before. On a theoretical level, I'm sure that's -- the answer to that is yes, but we've not hit that yet. We're not -- we are not at the point where there's a fundamental shift in strategy -- pricing strategy going on because we've hit some artificial barrier. There are no such artificial barriers. And I would resist the temptation, as you've described it, to say that rate is flattening out again. Even we can't make that statement, knowing everything that we know. It's which accounts came due, what were the returns on the individual accounts, what were the rate needs. It would be inappropriate to draw a conclusion -- good or bad -- from one quarter to the next. We'll have a better sense as we get into the third and fourth quarter as to what's actually happening. That I think is the meaning in the context of how we're continuing. Is the improvement in profitability going to continue to [indiscernible] itself in rate or in some other way? And the goal here, as Brian said before, is not to increase rate. It's to improve profitability. That's the goal. And it's -- so it would be a mistake, I think, to draw a flat conclusion from 7.5% versus 7.4%. What we do know is that if we look historically at the slope of that line, we feel very good about it. And that's the magic. That's the -- it's so easy in our business to not know enough that an increase in rate yet a modest decrease in retention not have it convert to improved profitability. It's not just getting rate and maintaining retention, it's getting rate for the right accounts, retaining the right ones, not retaining the wrong ones. And so it is indeed that granular to come to a conclusion of whether we are making progress on improving profitability, and we have a high degree of confidence that we are.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: That's very helpful. You've been good on raising rates. I'm just curious, you've a softening on the economy. How do you think that's going to impact your ability to raise rates?\nJay S. Fishman: Again, that's a sort of an outlook kind of question. When we started this -- this is interesting, and it's a legitimate question -- one of the things we were concerned about was the ability to raise rate in a difficult economic environment. I'm not sure that the environment got that much better or so far, it's getting that much worse. I think when you look broadly at it, it is largely kind of about the same. We do see pickup in exposure, that's been a plus. We do see a turn in Auto adjustments that were negative and have now become quite positive, that's a plus. It will -- we will certainly be challenged if, in fact, exposure begins to drop. Real exposure, not disclosed at the front but disclosed and then subsequently audited. It will be certainly more challenging to continue to improve profitability in that environment. And exposure has been modestly positive. Maybe even a little more than modestly. But it's been nicely positive. And so yes, I think if exposure really changes, not sort of the talking heads discussion of the economy on cable news, but if our accounts really begin to have less demands for insurance, it will be more challenging I'm sure to continue on in the process. Not impossible, but more challenging.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And then one last thing, if I may. [indiscernible] On the personal/Auto severity side. There was some discussion on high severity. Just a question on whether it seemed that ticked up in the last couple of quarters? Or is it similar to what you were seeing maybe over the last 1 year?\nBrian W. MacLean: We talked about in the fourth quarter and probably going back to the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year and very slightly into the first quarter of this year, what we've seen the last quarter was pretty flat with what we've been seeing before. But it's running at an elevated level, at a higher than historical norm level.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I just want to circle back on a couple points. First on the return on equity goal, if we look at the return on equity contribution from investment income, it's running in that 9% to 10% range. In this sustained low interest rate environment, how much downside do you see in that aspect of contribution? Then I have a follow-up.\nJay S. Fishman: First, I'd make an observation that portfolio continues to mature at about $6 billion to $7 billion a year, talking about the fixed income portfolio. So there is more repricing that will occur. It is not -- the current returns and, in fact, the decline over the last 12 months is not insignificant going from a tenure of 3 to 9, more precisely to 1.5. That will continue to have an impact. So it's -- the fixed income portfolio, all other things being the same, yield will continue to decline. It will decline modestly period-to-period because only $6 billion to $7 billion mature. But it will continue to decline, and that will indeed put -- make it more difficult. Jay, you're exactly right, make it more difficult to achieve that mid-teens ROE. Certainly, in the near-term, which is why I said in the near-term, one of the reasons important is the investment environment. You can't do it today. It's just not achievable. Now the question is, do we return back at some point to what we all would consider a more normal environment whatever that is, and how quickly does that occur? We've been at this level for actually a long time already. It was September -- the crisis was in '07, Lehman Brothers' issues were September of '08. We're up to 4 years now since that happened. This has been a long haul. And I have no crystal ball other than to think that rates are going to stay at this level for at least the intermediate term. Certainly, everything we're hearing from the Feds suggest that. But yes, it will just make it more challenging. No question.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Understood. Okay. And then maybe for Brian. Around that Business Insurance rate increase level, 7.4%, can you give some discussion in terms of the range you're seeing around that midpoint by major line of business whether that's property, workers comp, GL, Auto?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. I mean, it's actually pretty tight. The...\nJay S. Fishman: Tight by business, quite broad by account.\nMichael F. Klein: Right. So tight by line when you talk about -- and as I said in my comments, Comp and Auto are still running at the highest comp price change levels, but that's at about 9 points and -- but I think the lowest is about 6.5. So every product line is running at a decent rate increase. To Jay's point, the distribution by accounts is dramatic. So one point I'll make to just contrast how things move. Rough numbers, but if I look at our Commercial Accounts business a year ago, about 35% of our accounts were at 0 or a price decrease, and about 15% were getting 10% or more increase. That is actually flip-flopped. So right now about 35% of our Commercial Accounts renewals get a 10-or-more percent increase. But still 15% are at 0 or a negative. So it's a very granular execution. So there, there's a really broad range. Does that help?\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Very much.\nOperator: This does conclude the Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Nawi.\nGabriella Nawi: Very good. Thank you very much. We wish you a good day. And as always, Andrew Hersom and I are available for follow-up questions.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, April 19, 2012. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Tina. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2012 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks and responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay S. Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report a very strong start to 2012 driven by solid underwriting as well as investment results. In the quarter, we produced net income of $806 million or $2.02 per share and generated a 13.1% return on equity and a 14.7% operating return on equity. Even excluding the impact of net favorable prior-year development, which states the returns on an absolute year basis, the corresponding percentages are 9.9% and 11.1%. Net income of $806 million compares to $839 million last year, but last year included a $104 million benefit from the favorable resolution of prior-year tax matters. As we've shared with you previously, our current operating focus is simple and on course. Given the potential for continued severe weather in the United States as well as the outlook for continued low interest rates, we remain committed to improving our profitability by actively but selectively seeking price increases and improved terms and conditions on the products we sell. In Business Insurance, we continued to achieve improved pricing. Renewal rate change in the quarter was a positive 8%, up from 6% in the fourth quarter of 2011, while retention remained stable. Importantly, we believe that we differentiate ourselves from many in the marketplace by not taking a \"one size fits all\" approach to pricing. In our individual underwriting businesses, each customer's needs, characteristics, geographies and risk and loss profile is different, and as such, each transaction is analyzed and priced separately. In Select Accounts, analyzing the returns we earn from our insured\u2019s industry segment in conjunction with the individual insured characteristics is critical to success. We continue to leverage what we believe is industry-leading data and analytics to help us optimize rate and retention, that is, achieving higher retentions on our best customer relationships while simultaneously identifying the walk away point for our least-profitable relationships. This differentiation is best evidenced by an analysis of rate and retention by historical loss ratio performance that Brian will share with you later. We're very pleased how we're executing in the field, and this analysis summarize and demonstrates the effectiveness of our analytics and the thoughtful way we're approaching business pricing. In our Personal Insurance segment, we continue to take the necessary actions to increase returns, which include improved pricing, terms and conditions. Renewal price change in the quarter improved in automobile and Homeowners to 4% and 10%, respectively. In many states, we have implemented higher deductibles and changes to underwriting terms and conditions predominantly for new business. And while Personal Insurance new business in these states has been and may continue to be impacted for some time following these changes, we are convinced we are on the right course. I want to take just a moment to acknowledge the work our financial professional and international groups have done in recent years. Within FP&II, there are numerous businesses and product lines, each with its own individual story, but in the aggregate, we recorded a 24% improvement in profitability quarter-over-quarter and are more comfortable with our risk profile and better positioned for opportunity in our international business than we have been in the past. Additionally, the fact that our surety and Management Liability businesses have performed as well as they have is a real testament to risk management scale, especially given the economic environment over the last several years. The solid work these teams have done and continue to do is evidenced in their strong results. Lastly, I'm also pleased to report that our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the company's quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.46 per share. This brings our annual yield, based on last night's closing price, up to 3.1% from 2.8%. Since the merger of St. Paul and Travelers in 2004, the dividend has increased each year and, over this time period, has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 10%. As always, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks, Jay. I would characterize our first quarter results as being very strong and as having the following attributes: fixed income investment returns that were in line with our expectations; non-fixed income investment returns that benefited from strong equity market performance to the end of the quarter; underlying underwriting results that benefited from the significant price increases we have been achieving in recent months as well as growth in exposures and favorable audit premium adjustments; weather-related losses that were more or less within our expectations; and a relatively high level of net favorable prior-year reserve development. Brian is going to provide comments on our underwriting results, but before he does, let me say a few words about our reserves and their development. The strength of our reserves is evidenced by the net favorable prior-year reserve development we continue to experience: $200 million after tax in the first quarter, up from $155 million in last year's first quarter. While each segment once again reported net favorable prior-year reserve development, the Business Insurance segment was responsible for $162 million or approximately 80% of the total. BI's net favorable prior-year reserve development was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in general liability for the 2004 through 2009 accident years and commercial property for the 2010 accident year. Partially offsetting these favorable adjustments was the strengthening of our commercial auto reserves for the 2011 accident year due to higher-than-expected frequency and severity. Financial, Professional & International Insurance contributed net favorable prior-year reserve development of $31 million after tax in the quarter, a little higher than last year's first quarter primarily due to the better-than-expected loss experience in our surety business within Bond & Financial Products for the 2006 through 2008 accident years as well as in several lines of business in Canada and Lloyd's. Turning to financial strength indicators. All remain in excellent shape. First quarter operating cash flows were very strong at $814 million, a holding company liquidity of $2.2 billion and all of our capital ratios ended the quarter at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains, which were $4.35 billion at the end of the quarter or $2.8 billion after tax, decreased only slightly from year end, entirely due to movements in interest rates and credit spreads, while book value per share rose to $63.81, 2% higher than the beginning of the year and 7% higher than a year ago. And finally, as always, we remain fully committed to identifying and returning excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned a little over $500 million to our shareholders through common stock repurchases of $350 million and dividends of $162 million. Brian is now going to provide further commentary on our underwriting results.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. A great quarter on many levels. And from an underwriting perspective, our GAAP combined ratio of 92.2% was 2.5 points better than 2011, and adjusting for cats and prior-year reserve development, the combined was 94.6% or 1.1 points better than 2011. So a really good start to the year. In Business Insurance, we are extremely pleased with our results this quarter. Operating income of $612 million was up slightly from a very good quarter last year, which included a $76 million tax benefit. Pricing continued to be very strong, with renewal premium change of 9% that included pure rate increases of 8%. Importantly, the improved rate that we achieved was broad based, with rate increases in all product lines between 6 and 9 points, with the workers comp and auto lines at the top end of that range. Net written premiums were up year-over-year driven by these pricing gains as well as solid exposure growth and audit premiums. By line, the growth was driven by workers compensation, again resulting from price and exposure increases. For your reference, Page 9 of the webcast shows the reconciliation of net written premiums quarter-over-quarter, and we believe this speaks to a picture of improved profitability on the business. Retentions remained solid, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2011 driven by improvements in commercial accounts. As you can see on Slide 11, Select Accounts retention has declined from 81% in the first quarter of 2011 to 75% in the current quarter. As we have discussed many times, our select business includes Select Express, the smaller-account-sized business; and Select Plus, the larger individually underwritten accounts. In Express, retention has come down modestly and is currently at 78%. In Plus, retention is down much more significantly to 71%. In the Plus business, based on our view of account and segment profitability, the competition has continued to price business very aggressively and at returns we do not consider acceptable. Accordingly, our retention is the result of our active and very deliberate strategy to seek the appropriate price for each account, and we are very comfortable with this volume and profitability trade-off. So stepping back to rate and retention for all of Business Insurance, we're very pleased with the results, but importantly, we're also very focused on how we got to those results. By that, I mean, did we get the rate increases where needed? And did we retain our best business? An example of how we manage this approach is on Slide 14, which shows our rate change and retention data for commercial accounts segmented by the individual accounts' long-term loss ratio. So the bar on the left represents our best-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios of less than 60%, and the bar on the right represents our worst-performing accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%. You can see that the retention ratio was stronger for the better accounts and the rate change is dramatically higher on the poorer-performing accounts. I want to emphasize 2 points. First, our actual pricing and underwriting decisions are made on individual accounts. Secondly, that this is -- this exhibit presents summarized data and we actually measure and manage our performance on a much more granular level: by business, by product line, by industry and by geography. And the conclusion is we feel great about how we're executing at those levels. Turning to loss trend. Across Business Insurance, we are seeing loss inflation at about 4% overall, which is consistent with our expectations. As with the rate story, by line, there's a pretty tight range around that number, with workers comp and auto slightly above the average. Looking specifically at workers comp, the frequency increase we talked to you about in prior quarters has stabilized. And in commercial auto, we continue to see a modest pressure in bodily injury severity and in physical damage frequency and severity. So in closing on Business Insurance, a critical takeaway: In the quarter, the earned impact of our pricing actions exceeded our current estimate of the quarter's loss trend by about 50 basis points. And this is obviously a step in the right direction. In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, we had another very strong quarter, with operating income of $149 million, up 24% from the prior year. The improvement is due to lower level of cat losses as well as improved underlying margins in our international business where we believe underwriting initiatives have resulted in a better balance of risk and reward. Looking at production, Management Liability net written premiums were up 7% year-over-year as retention levels and renewal premium gains were at their highest levels in several years and new business volume was also strong. Management Liability is an area where we've made significant investments in technology and analytics, and the increased volume we are seeing shows that those investments are paying off. In addition, we are seeing the most growth in our more profitable lines. In surety, volumes continued to be impacted by decreased construction spending, while in international, net written premiums were down $8 million or 3%, reflecting the impact of our decision to exit the personal lines business in Ireland, as well as an increase in ceded premium year-over-year. So all in, a very strong quarter for the segment. In Personal Insurance, first quarter operating income, excluding cats and prior-year development, was $176 million, up 5% from the first quarter of 2011. The GAAP combined ratio, also excluding cats and prior year, was 92.3% and, excluding the impact of the direct-to-consumer initiative, 90.3%. So the underlying profitability, the agency business, was very solid. Looking at production. In Agency Auto, renewal premium change was 4%, up 1 point from the fourth quarter, and retention remained strong at 83%. In agency property, we also saw improved pricing, with renewal premium change of 10%, up from 8% in the fourth quarter, along with continued strong retention. In both lines, new business volumes have been impacted by our pricing and underwriting actions. Loss trends in home have remained within our expectations, while in auto, we continued to see severity pressures that we disclosed last quarter with a slight uptick in physical damage lines. Given the desire to improve auto margins that we discussed last quarter and the possibly of continued unusual weather patterns, we will continue to take the actions necessary to improve profitability in both auto and Homeowners. We've filed for additional rate increases in both products in a number of states. And in Homeowners, we've also continued to implement underwriting changes along with changes in terms and conditions, such as higher deductibles. As with Business Insurance, we continually measure the balance between profitability and growth in a very granular way, and we remain very comfortable with our actions. With that, I'll open it for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on insurance pricing levels. I know no one said that they've peaked, but they clearly are in excess of loss cost trends in most lines. Are you guys still seeing momentum there? And can you comment on Management Liability? Rates increased 4% there, do you think there's momentum in that specific line of business?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, Mike, so this is Brian MacLean. I'll start off. And speaking specifically to Business Insurance, I'd start by emphasizing and repeating what we just said, that we feel good about where the market was this past quarter. And the 8% rate, 9% total price and the retention levels we're getting and, specifically, where we're getting it by account and by type of business, we felt good about. Our position in the marketplace right now as we move forward is, we're not changing our strategy at all. We're looking to continue to prove -- improve our returns. You are absolutely right, that we're now at a point where we're earning in something in excess of our current view of loss trends. And we don't make long-term predictions on the market, but we do have pretty good visibility into what's going to happen 60 to 90 days out. We're obviously quoting business out there and we have a decent view into April. And so we feel good about what we're seeing in the second quarter and, from a written basis, feel that the momentum is somewhat continuing. So we feel very good about where we are.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. And then lastly, in regards to workers comp frequency stabilizing, could you comment on what level it's -- has stabilized at?\nBrian W. MacLean: I don't know if we've specifically disclosed it, but it's...\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Would you say it's at a level that's going down in terms of the trend, the absolute level of frequency?\nJay S. Benet: This is Jay Benet. I think, in the fourth quarter, we've seen it level out. And we really haven't seen a change in the first quarter relative to what we have been seeing, so it's running within our expectations. Nothing has really changed.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, I mean, it's pretty close to 0, is what we're seeing and it's very stable.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: And have rates, pricing, has that continued to improve on that line?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. I mean, we've -- workers comp is at the highest end of the price increases we're getting, and we feel good about what we've been able to do there. On the Management Liability side, Alan...\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Mike, it's Alan Schnitzer. You asked about Management Liability pricing, as well. And you mentioned before, the pricing is actually up 2. Overall, RPC is up 4, and 1/2 of that's rate and 1/2 of it's exposure. We are -- it is our strategy to continue to try to get rate in those lines where we think we need it. And just based on our feel for the market and what we're doing 30, 60, 90 days out, we think there's some room for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie Group.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: The first question is on the discussion on retentions. Obviously, the retentions have trended down successively every quarter. And I'm just wondering, if you keep on pushing rates, do we get to somewhat of a low-70s retention number as we approach end of 2012? Or do you think that the retentions numbers are exhibiting some signs of stabilizing, going forward?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, so a couple responses to that. This is Brian. I'll start, and then -- let me start by saying that, historically, when we look at retentions in our core Business Insurance, at an 80% level, with the right execution and the right analytics, we feel that -- as a matter of fact, we don't have any doubt that we can perform very well at an 80% retention. We had said consistently, going back a year or so ago when we were running at 84, 85s, that those were at historical high levels and we did not expect to continue to have the business there. So we feel pretty good about where we are today from a retention perspective. As you pointed out, quarter-over-quarter, it went up a blip so fundamentally stable where it is. The other thing I would emphasize back to that exhibit we showed in the webcast: We look really hard at, as retentions move up or down, why they are moving up or down. And to state the obvious, but it's -- the execution on this is critical. If we're retaining our best business and retention is softening in the weaker business because the market -- because we can't get the price increases that we think we need, we're going to be perfectly fine with that trade-off. So we don't sit here with a magic number and say, if it gets to 75, we're at a panic level. If -- whatever. It's really about the composition of what's going on inside of it.\nJay S. Fishman: And this is Jay Fishman. I'd just add 2 quick comments. First, just to clarify, in Business Insurance, the retention was actually stable, dead on, first quarter to fourth quarter. So sequentially there, that was actually a tiny bit up. It rounds to a flat number, but it was actually the tiniest bit up. And so sequentially, it is right on. And I'd point also to Brian's comments about the Plus business. There's no question that, if we had a different strategy in Select Plus, the retention could be 5, 6, 7 points higher, but our analysis suggests that, that's not the way to create long-term value. And a lot of -- in many of these market segments, in fact in most, it's an active decision, not a passive reaction. We make the decision of the price-retention trade-off all the time. And the slide that Brian showed that ties loss ratios to retention in rate is absolutely critical in the analysis particularly as you get into a granular level. And we actually -- if you do some quick arithmetic on that slide, what you'll see is the summary of that slide shows an 18-point rate increase against accounts with a historical loss ratio or long-term loss ratio in excess of 90%. That -- the result, the arithmetic result of that is a 14% decline, not a 14-point decline but a 14% decline in the actual loss ratio. I mean, it's meaningful. So it's -- as you have the analytics and the ability to look at your book of business just as granularly as we do, we tend to view the retention as a result of thoughtful, well-executed strategies, not a target or a byproduct that's in effect for us -- on us.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Got it. That's helpful. Just one other question and this is a follow-up to the prior question. In terms of California comp, you mentioned that -- I'm sorry, the workers comp line, you said that the rates were at the highest end of the range. And I couldn't quite discern what exactly the number was, what you were alluding to, what exactly that number is. I think you mentioned the loss costs were 4%. Just trying to understand the delta between pricing and loss cost. And if I understand correctly, what you were suggesting in the prior answer was that, probably, the way you look at it, 2010 was the peak in terms of loss cost. And I know you've discussed that in the past, too.\nBrian W. MacLean: So let me do a couple things and I'll repeat some of the stuff, just to make it clear. We said 8 points of rate increase between 6 and 9 by line, and comp was at the high end of that. So -- and then on the loss costs, I said 4% across all of BI, with a relatively tight band by product line around that. And comp is at the high end of that. I mean, comp and auto were the 2 lines where we're seeing the most loss pressure and we're seeing the highest rate increases. So we think there's rational behavior there.\nJay S. Fishman: And what Brian gave you in rate just a moment ago was the written rate increase. And importantly, he shared with you that the earned effect of the pricing strategy, not just rate but that portion of exposure that acts like rate, actually had an earned impact in the quarter of approximately 50 basis points higher than the -- than our current estimate of loss trend.\nBrian W. MacLean: Right. Now you made a comment and I wasn't quite sure where you were going but that we implied that the fourth quarter was kind of the peak of...\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: No, the 2010. 2010 was the peak in terms of loss trend.\nGabriella Nawi: [indiscernible] Amit, this is Gabby. When Brian said the question we had been asked was workers comp frequency, which we were saying was essentially flat. But certainly, that is never implying that workers comp loss costs are flat. Obviously, we've always talked about the severity dynamics to it.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: So is it still going up, overall? Or you think that it's stabilized at this level?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, the question is what is -- that you're asking is, we're not exactly sure what you mean by it leveling. Our -- when you add in frequency and severity and you look at workers compensation -- and I'll say this without checking all the facts, but Gabby can. I think, in virtually every year, that it's a net positive inflation rate on loss costs that, even if severity -- even if frequency has been down, our assumption about the combination of medical inflation and indemnity inflation, both, more than offset whatever the underlying assumption has been even in a declining frequency arena. So our analysis always is that loss costs are always rising year-to-year.\nBrian W. MacLean: Right. And then so the pieces we're giving...\nJay S. Fishman: As we've already [ph] said. Sometimes, we get favorable reserve development years later, and lots of you comment on that, where our initial loss estimates turned out to be way too high where, in one year, too low, and it obviously changes. But as we initially set them, we're always contemplating an increase in the inflation dynamic on a combined basis.\nBrian W. MacLean: And I'll repeat the pieces we had given you, and I think they can get you pretty close. I mean, we just said frequency was about 0 across all of BI. Frequency Plus severity is about 4%, and comp's a little bit above that. So that, I think, gives you the pieces, yes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Wanted to just ask about the buyback and the dividends. A very nice increase in the dividend in the quarter, but it looks to me like you -- the combined $500 million in buybacks and dividends was less than operating income. And I just wanted to -- and perhaps you said it in your commentary, but I just want to just reassess, what is the guidance for capital management, going forward? Is it 100% of operating income to be returned to shareholders?\nJay S. Benet: Yes, this is Jay Benet. We try to be as clear as we can about this in our 10-Q. So let me just reiterate a couple of points. First of all, just in terms of the magnitude in the first quarter, we did return, as I said, a little over $500 million, $350 million in the form of repurchases, the rest in terms of dividends. Obviously, we don't know the actual amount of earnings in a quarter until the quarter is over, so we are buying back our shares during the quarter based on some presumption of where we'll be. I'll remind you that, and this is what is written in the Q, the combination of dividends and share repurchases isn't likely to exceed the income for the year. And the share repurchases are also going to depend on a variety of factors. There are capital needs that we have as we grow our business. Maintaining capital levels commensurate with ratings. We do buybacks on the basis of having excess cash available. So we take into account pension funding needs and other corporate needs. So there's lots of things that go into it. And I wouldn't read from any particular quarter the earnings of the quarter versus the amount of the share repurchases as indicative of much of anything at this point.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's very helpful. And then shifting gears, on the core margin side, excellent trends. Everything you're saying is sort of playing out in the reported numbers. The one thing I'm trying to tie, though, Brian, is you mentioned earned premium is ahead of losses -- loss trend by 50 basis points in Business Insurance. And yet, if we're doing our math right, it looks to me like the core margin for that specific unit actually deteriorated by 30 bps year-over-year, which is -- points to a very near-term inflection point for that division importantly. And so I'm trying to tie the \"earned premium to loss\" commentary with the reported number. And I guess the question will be, is there a lag? Or how should we be thinking about that in the models?\nBrian W. MacLean: And I assume, when you say you're looking at the reported -- if I look at the x cats, x prior-year development combined ratio for Business Insurance, it was 96.4%. A year ago in the first quarter, it was 96%, but importantly, for the full year of 2011, it was 97.9%. So we've got some pretty significant improvement: It's come down 4 consecutive quarters. With all of that said, in any given quarter, there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to go into the combined ratio that, when I talk about that core margin expansion, I'm not talking about unusual weather, I would -- so I'd be taking out favorable or unfavorable weather, large losses, mix of business changes. We could be moving something in the accident year that's going to distort that given quarter's GAAP combined ratio. So I think, in a specific quarter, there can be a lot going on. Obviously, as we go forward, we're going to speak to those things. But the core underlying margins showed some improvement in the quarter and bodes well for the future.\nJay S. Fishman: And while we -- Greg, this is Jay. Thanks for the question. It -- while we don't -- certainly don't want to make predictions about rates or anything else, the one thing that is quite just arithmetic and quite predictable is the effect of written rate because you can go back, you take 1/12 of the previous month, plus 1/12 of the month before that and 1/12 of the month before that and you calculate the rate dynamic, and you can actually calculate the rate impact on premium, the earned rate impact. Now there's a portion that's not nearly as visible to outsiders. There's a portion of exposure that really looks like rate. It doesn't have loss cost associated with it, a change in valuation on a property. So there are elements, so we very granularly go through that. And so on the presumption that, that exposure piece stays the same quarter to quarter, what we can say with reasonable assurance, because things would have to change so dramatically is to be unlikely, is that the earned rate impact in the second quarter, earned rate, will be higher than the first. That's pretty ascertainable at this point. We don't know obviously what our second quarter view of loss trend is, and so it's very difficult to make predictions and feel like you're doing it in any substantive way, but the earned rate impact is really quite discernible.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Walsh of Citi.\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Thanks for the slides on retention. Very helpful in the pack. Just getting back to Jay Fishman's comments earlier, on Slide 14. Can you talk a little bit about the elasticity of retention and the trade-off between raising rates on the really good loss ratio business that looks like it's sub-60 versus keeping more of it, retaining more and maybe not raising rate as much?\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, that's -- it's -- actually, it's a very good question and it really gets to the core of how we execute in the marketplace. The -- first, in its most simplistic form -- and you all are knowledgeable enough about our industry to understand it: If you get 1 point of rate, 85% of that, I'm taking 15 points of commissions and taxes, direct costs, if you will, fall right to the pretax line. So 1 point of rate is really quite powerful from a profitably standpoint. Now 1 point of retention has dramatically lower impact on profitability because you have all the loss costs associated with it. So you have the variable cost that goes up, but you also have the direct loss cost that goes with it. So it's quite easy to say that 1 point of rate is worth a multiple, 5x. And I'm guessing at that number, sitting here this morning, but 5x 1 point of retention. Now the -- that theory is good until your last account. At some point, it breaks down. But as we sit here looking at 1 point of rate on the margin versus 1 point of retention, that's a really easy call as long as we're being thoughtful about how it's executed. Now I'm going to get back to the slide you referenced. One of the reasons why we don't at all set a corporate mandate for pricing -- and there are some, we believe, companies that do. They say, \"You've got to get x percent on a renewal or you can't renew it.\" Well, what happens is you'll lose your best accounts because they don't need the x percent of rate. And in your least-profitable accounts, you get the x, and it needed twice x. And so while it looks initially like you've done good work, the fact is you've got underlying real adverse selection working against you. So first on the margin, when you're in an improving profitably dynamic, that point of rate versus the point of retention is just such an easy call. On the marginal dynamic, that's an easy one. And -- but importantly, the ability to execute and understand where one draws the line on that chart is just critical to the actual improvement in profitability. Otherwise, you're going to have a whole series of operating dynamics that are going to look great, but unfortunately, it's never really going to translate into improved profitability. So it's the combination of recognizing the trade-off between rate and retention, which again, on the margin, is an easy one, but executing it based upon the history of the account. I'd make one other point with respect to that chart because it's really an important one and it can get lost. This is the long-term loss ratio. So if we -- this is the actual experience of an account up to as much as 7 years, if we have the account that long, because we also understand the premise that an account can be terrific performing over 2, 3, 4, 5 years and then have an unusual loss, an unusual fire. And you certainly don't want to react dramatically to one insured loss. We're in the insurance business, we anticipate losses. So it's not -- we're not looking at a 12-month loss performance here because, again, that would give you a potentially very adverse effect as well. This -- analytics here enable us to look at the long-term profitability of an individual account.\nBrian W. MacLean: I just want to emphasize. This is Brian again. One other thing I made in my comments generally, but I think it's really important to understand who we are and why we think we can perform the way we do in the industry. The exhibit that we've got is a very simplified view of how we actually manage this. So what we actually use in our operation doesn't just have 3 segments, it has at least 5 by each of our business. So we've got our business separated by quintiles and it's got the long-term combined loss ratio plus a bunch of other factors. So we're not just looking at the loss experience of the account. We're looking at a lot of other things. And we're looking at that by individual business, by industry, by geography. And believe me, when we see the numbers come out, we go, \"Okay, they look okay, they don't look okay, but let's really understand why.\" So your question, again, Jay said it is great, that keeping the best business for the right reasons and taking the right actions on the more challenged business is what we have to do. And at the end of the day, that's going to result in numbers. And if we did the right things, we're going to be happy with what the numbers are.\nJay S. Fishman: And I -- while I can't prove this to you because I'm giving you back the reflection of conversations with agents and brokers -- we tend to forget about them in these conversations. There's an agent or broker who represents every single account that we're dealing with here. And that agent or broker understands the market deeply, understands alternatives and choices and flexibility and in the end makes a recommendation to his client based upon the actions that we're taking. One of the reasons, and this just comes from conversation, that agents continue to be supportive of the strategy here is that it's not being applied as a \"one size fits all\" dynamic. When we sit down and have a conversation about an account, it becomes apparent why we're having that conversation. And we're not -- we talked earlier about never -- we're trying hard not to be disruptive to an agent's business or to our insurance business, and that means getting granular enough to understand that the pricing actions fit the individual account and account strategy that you have. And that's one of the reasons why agents can embrace it because they understand what we're doing and they understand the economics behind it.\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Okay, that's very helpful. And then the second question I just had on Slide 9, the new business number and the revenue roll-forward or the premium roll-forward of $423 million; retention, really good, keeping it stable. It seems like this number is a little more challenged. Does this speak to a more competitive market with lots of capacity for new business? And just how do you -- how does that intertwine with your view on expanding rates, going forward?\nJay S. Fishman: Is your question -- I'm sorry, just to clarify, is your question that the new business amount seems low to you?\nKeith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division: Yes.\nJay S. Fishman: I think we would agree with that, actually. It's really very difficult to -- we remind folks all the time that the profitability of our business and its long-term value-creation is a lot more dependent on how we treat our renewal book than what happens in our new. And the last thing that we really want is for agents to be confused, to find that we're being thoughtful and disciplined in our renewal book but we're being aggressive from a pricing standpoint from new business. I -- and so we recognize, going into this, that it was entirely possible as we became somewhat more urgent about profitability improvement, that the new business levels could very well fall off. Now this is a summary of lots of areas. There are some areas where I think we've overdone it a little bit where I think we could -- I think we've been almost too conservative with respect to new business and we've got to dial up. It gets -- it's not an overall strategy. There are regions where we've got it just right when we look at the numbers and it's working terrifically. And there are others where we've gotten a little too conservative and you want to dial that back just the littlest bit. But I don't perceive it as a comment on the competitive market. I'm sure there's some truth to that, but I think the more substantive dynamic is the approach that we bring to our enthusiasm, our aggressiveness or our conservatism at the point of new business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Jay, looking at the overall x cat and x prior-year development combined ratio of 94.6%, it's meaningfully improved from any of the 4 quarters of 2011. And I just want to get your sense as to whether we should think of that as the right run rate, going forward?\nJay S. Benet: Jay, this is Jay Benet. I think it's -- what Jay and Brian were talking about is the earning end of rate increases that we've been getting over the past 12 months. And when you think about whatever estimates you're making for a loss cost trend, you have to look at the amortization effectively of these written rate increases. And you've essentially seen an upward sloping line of rate increases in that period of time. So just arithmetically, if nothing else changed, if the weather was exactly the same, if loss cost trends were exactly the same, you would just see the combined ratio move in a favorable way based upon that amortization. So we'll see that happens with all the things I just mentioned. But it's not that it's reached a steady state, it's reached a different state than it's been in.\nJay S. Fishman: And Jay, I would add that one of the things we're taking for granted here as we're responding is that you understand the impact not only of catastrophic weather, which you immediately pulled out, but small weather, such as we call it around here, has had a significant impact quarter-to-quarter and even has some seasonality to it. It's not just a property loss. We've seen -- traditionally, fourth quarter, there are more auto accidents. We can have a conversation about why that is. And even the fact when there wasn't bad weather in the fourth quarter, there still seems to be some seasonality, so it's not quite as smooth as we'd all like to think. It would sure make it easier for us to manage if it was, but there is some seasonality and movement up and down, so I'd resist the temptation to just say, that's the number and it gets better from here. I have no idea what the next 3 quarters will bring, but I'm sure we're going to be sitting in front of you with some quarter where small weather was either much better than we thought it was going to be or much worse than we thought it was going to be. And that's going to evidence itself in the numbers that quarter.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I see. And my follow-up question is, was there any seasonal influence on the pace of reserve releases in the first quarter? Is there a certain book of business that gets analyzed because that picked up as well versus any of the prior 4 quarters?\nJay S. Benet: No. Our reserving processes are very uniform quarter-to-quarter. So this is just getting really the fourth quarter data from last year, analyzing in conjunction with everything else we've known about the reserves and seeing some very favorable movements. As you know, when you're looking at reserve development, you're seeing trends, you have to always determine whether those trends are real or whether there's some anomaly that's taking place. So we do want to make sure that there's enough data that has manifested itself as being real before we make adjustments, but that's something that's going to happen on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There's really no magic about the fourth quarter versus any other quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I just have actually one question about -- I know there was a case, a John Mansville (sic) [Johns Manville] case, that was talked about in the first quarter just in the media in an asbestos settlement there. Did that have any impact on the reserve development in the first quarter?\nJay S. Benet: This is Jay Benet. No, we had no change whatsoever in our asbestos reserves in the first quarter or our environmental reserves. Actually, you can see that in all the discussion associated with the litigation and asbestos information.\nJay S. Fishman: There's no provision. I'm sure we have paids.\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Right.\nJay S. Benet: I\u2019m sorry. We had no provision. No incurreds. We did have paids...\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then you -- I assume having asked this before, is -- on the 2010 book, you had some latent frequency, some late-reported claims. And I just wanted to see if we can get an update in terms of, has the late-reported claim activity abated for the 2010 comp accident year? And is it too early to talk about whether or not any of that activity has manifested in the '11 accident year?\nBrian W. MacLean: So this is Brian. And again, you're talking specifically about comp year. So no, I think that we've seen the frequency dynamic relative to that business level off, and so we did not see any further activity in the first quarter on the 2010 year and are not seeing a similar dynamic through 2011.\nJay S. Benet: There's no change of any magnitude of -- in workers\u2019 comp reserves for either 2010 or 2011.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And then just last one. It was on the Slide 14, you mentioned -- what is the retention? What has been that sort of trend of retention over time, if you can? And I realize there's a lot of information in that slide, but are you seeing an improved retention of the business you want or stable retention of the business you want as you've taken rate over the past several quarters relative to kind of the retention of the business that you would rather not have that's on the higher side of the loss ratio spectrum?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, this is Brian. I would say, directionally, from a retention perspective, this is pretty consistent what we would say. It's the strongest retentions to the left here, and this one obviously, the middle bar, is slightly higher. But very solid retentions, in the plus 80% and the weaker activity on the far right. So I think, directionally, it's going to be similar.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, what we do from time to time is we look in our management information system for things that we use to manage the business and share them with you. So this is a slide that is prepared for many of our businesses on a monthly basis that we have just compiled for you to see the granularity in which we actually manage it. But it's not something that's showing a different view than what we would previously have had, had we been putting this together for you.\nJay S. Fishman: The analytics are not new. The analytics have actually been around for a long time. This is -- particularly just given the rate environment and some of the focus that some of you have had on rate and retention, we thought it would be helpful for you to actually see it and understand how granular you need to be for the strategy to be successful.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: A couple of questions. First, just on the Page 14 slide. The over-simplistic view of the world might be that you'd expect lower retentions as you go up in terms of the loss ratio bands, but when we look to 60% to 90%, it's a little bit higher than the less-than-60% band. I'm assuming a lot of that just has to do with mix, but would love a little color there.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, it's Brian. I wouldn't overly analyze the precision of the -- which bars are higher. It was meant to be pretty much a representation of something, as we've said over and over, that we actually manage on a much more granular basis. We also don't look at just the loss ratio and the loss performance, so it's -- you've got a lot of other things going on there. As Jay said, it's a long-term loss ratio, so...\nJay S. Fishman: I'd actually remind you, because this is I think a pretty good example. We have shared with you in previous quarters, this goes back perhaps a year, that when we bring on a block of new business, what that loss ratio performance looks like and largely through the implementation of our own loss management practice, we're sitting with a group of 750 professionals who are really dedicated to helping our middle-market customers lower their losses. So if we've come into a situation that's not been managed, that we've not had before, it's new and they are engaging with us in loss management practices so that we actually believe that we can help them lower their loss experience in a reasonably short period of time, that will have us have one view of the account versus another kind of account that simply doesn't do it. That's another example of an important variable that goes into what our thinking about price and return acceptability is. We're -- we -- the reason we give you a long-term loss ratio here, how we look at it, is because that's what we're trying to achieve: long-term loss ratio performance that creates real value for everyone, by the way, not just for us but also for the customer. So that's an example of a pretty good variable, an important variable that we consider as we go through the pricing analysis.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, that's fair. I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it right in terms of -- to the point you just made, there might be business in there you think shifts to a better cohort in terms of loss ratio over time to the actions you think you could take. There could be business in there that is Homeowners in the state of Oklahoma, which probably is suffering from last year, but you're making changes to try to -- I just want to get around some of -- I'm just trying to make sure I'm thinking about some of those things correctly.\nJay S. Fishman: You are, although, I'll point out this is just commercial accounts you're looking at. [indiscernible] This is just commercial accounts. So Homeowners Oklahoma, not part of this, but your concept is right.\nBrian W. MacLean: But your concept is right.\nMatthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Yes, okay. I could have said small business Alabama instead. Okay, no, that's fair. And then just on the dividend, I guess one of my questions I have is, if cycles have changed, and we've talked about this a little bit in the past, and we're now troughing out at higher levels of -- higher earnings return levels than we would have in the past, how do you change -- you just raised the dividend, but if I kind of look at the new dividend, it's only -- if 2011 accident year earnings with kind of a 3.5% cat load is the right way to think about kind of the earnings base, that would still only represent kind of a high-30s payout ratio, which when you think about historical trough payout ratios or peak payout ratios for all the trough earnings seems pretty low. So just curious how you -- how -- whether or not that impacts how you think about the dividend over time and potentially kind of what a dividend payout could look like.\nJay S. Fishman: First, I'll tell you that we analyze it here independent of any cycle dynamics. We just, as I -- we shared with you before, we're not big believers in the concept of some mythical cycle that carries everyone up and then carries everyone down. But the nice thing about our whole capital strategy is that our philosophy is to return it all, is to return all the excess capital, and it's really in a combination of share buybacks as well as dividends. And so we don't perseverate a lot about the payout ratio. We also recognize that you can have a 1 in 500 event tomorrow and then you could have another 1 in 500 event the following week, and suddenly our payout ratio would look real high. So we always stand ready to pay claims, have liquidity, be available to make the payments we need to make and yet have a philosophy of we're not keeping any capital here that we don't think we can use productively. And we could certainly have an interesting debate about whether dividends and share buybacks have preference. And I've talked to many shareholders and I would tell you that it's split about 50-50 as I talk to them. So it's not something that we spend a lot of time, really, dwelling on. As long as we have a competitive yield, an attractive yield for owning our stock and we're committed to returning the rest of the capital, we think we're in pretty good position.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Langen McAlenney.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: On the commercial auto reserve strengthening, you had strengthening last year for that line. It's continuing now. You mentioned frequency and severity. I'm wondering if, given how long this is persisting, whether or not it's become more of a severe -- severity issue on the margin for you guys.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, Larry, this is Jay Benet. The trends that we had been seeing, we factor into our loss specs. And what we saw in the first quarter, based upon the analysis of the fourth quarter results, was a higher level of frequency and a higher level of severity. In the physical damage area, we're just seeing higher costs associated with car repairs. And every time you get more data, you're trying to evaluate what the proper pick is. And in some respects, we're chasing it a little bit. The dollar magnitude is not very much. When you look at what we're seeing in commercial auto as part of the reserve development, it's like $50 million. So don't think -- on a pretax basis. Don't think of this as some very, very large item for us, but like everything else we're doing, we react quickly and decisively to the kind of information we see. And as Brian said, it does impact our pricing as we move forward.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Great, that's helpful. And then can you just give us a little color, if there's any to be had, on your lower advertising spend for your direct consumer? Clearly, the underwriting loss associated with debs [ph] also came down in the quarter. Has -- is anything changing on the margin with the strategy there?\nJay S. Fishman: Larry, no. Our strategy remains the same, and I think this is worth just 1 minute or 2. It's -- we made this investment as a long-term investment, and I'd just start off by saying that none of us feel differently about how we believe our independent agents' personal lines business is going to act. We know the customers we have. We know their socioeconomic dynamics. We know their risk management needs. It's hard for us to believe that, that class of customer is ultimately one day going to really want to take it on himself without someone advocating for choice and alternatives, but we also recognize that we could be wrong. And so we're going to -- we began to underwrite this with 2 concepts. First, a defensive one, which was, if we were wrong about the longer term and we wanted to be positioned to be able to respond. And then offensively, we also saw the possibility. And we do see who the customer is who buys direct, that's one of the real learnings of this. We understand now with real clarity who it is who's buying, that to the extent that change continued could we create a model that would build a successful business around it? And we started with nothing. We started without the technology or people in seats or an understanding or a marketing program. And over all these periods, I can tell you the things that have gone just terrifically. We have a technology platform that's solid and reliable. We have developed a marketing approach that actually does generate response, importantly, things that we learn. We figured, once someone would begin a quote process, they'd finish it. And we learned in the early days, not so. That in our early days, lots of the customers would start and then drop off. That required changes in processes and people and the rest, and ultimately, we now have solved that problem. We're pretty good at getting people to respond. We're pretty good at getting responders to get to a quote. And the next step is to get the quotes converted to sales. And so now, we're talking about not only process but pricing and competitive positioning and how the product is sold and the advice that's given. And we're going to gear our advertising spend now to when there's something to be learned when we're making a change, implementing a process and we've got to see what happens, so we'll go out and we'll be more active and we'll drive activity and we'll be able -- we'll be able to see what comes back at us. If we -- the great risk in all this, and 20 years ago, this happened to us once before, we had a great marketing success but a financial failure. And we're going to guard very carefully not to have that happen. And before we begin to really step down, we're going to make sure that there's a real -- a high likelihood of success financially that we can make the requisite investments, start to do the spending that's necessary to drive more activity and ultimately convert it, not only to sales but to sales that are priced and underwritten that produce an appropriate return. And we're just not there yet. We're not at that level. But we have a talented group of people who are driving the effort. It gets the attention of the senior leadership here. It's 1 of the 2 most strategic initiatives that we have. It's not a backwater activity, it's front and center. I'm proud of what we're accomplishing, but we're not going to make the real bad misstep of being convinced that we're ready to go before we are. So it's just going to be cautious, and we're going to keep learning and we're going to keep going. But I wouldn't read anything into the timing of our spending other than what's tied to the underlying process changes from which we're trying to learn.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Jay, could I add one thing? This is Doreen Spadorcia. And I just wanted to make one other comment. In addition to that, we will have a lumpy spend. It's not going to be a set amount of dollars that you'll see every month. For example, we're looking at local heavy-up in the next few quarters, so you may not even see us on national TV. But in particular states where we know we've got a broad product appetite and match, we'll be in those places. In addition, we are spending quite a bit of time on digital marketing. Again, things you might not see and the cost structure might be different but very targeted, again, to the kind of customer that we match with so, again to Jay's point, that we can push that conversion rate up. So you just won't see probably big national spends, but we are doing marketing. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Gabriella Nawi for any closing remarks.\nGabriella Nawi: Very good. Thank you, Tina. Thank you for joining us all today.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay S. Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we're very pleased to report a terrific fourth quarter to conclude a very impressive 2013. We posted full year operating income of $3.6 billion, coming from dramatic improvements in our underlying underwriting margins over the past 2 years, continued contributions from prior year reserve development, as well as more modest level of catastrophe losses than we've experienced in recent years. These operating results, combined with our strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders, led to record earnings per diluted share of $9.46 and an operating return on equity of 15.5%. For the fourth quarter, we generated $981 million in operating income, producing operating earnings per share -- per diluted share of $2.68 and an operating return on equity of nearly 17%. I don't think we could be more pleased than we are with these results, particularly given the challenges that our industry has been facing over the last several years including, historically, low interest rates and more volatile weather patterns. These 1-year results should not be viewed in isolation, but rather as part of the journey we've been on since 2010, when we articulated a clear strategy of thoughtfully and appropriately increasing the profitability for our products, particularly for those that were not meeting profitability thresholds. While improved rate, terms and conditions were our tactics, our strategy was, is and will remain all about producing superior returns. The returns of our products had deteriorated over a number of years from declining pricing, and the return deterioration was exacerbated after the financial crisis, when interest rates fell to historic lows. In addition, it was apparent that weather patterns, at least in recent periods, had become more volatile. With the philosophy of not reaching for yield in our investment portfolio beyond where the risk return balance is appropriate, our strategy was to improve the price and, where appropriate, the terms and conditions of products that we sell so as to improve the returns on an account-by-account or class-by-class basis, with the additional goal of not disrupting our agent's business or the relationship with our insureds. The results since then have been nothing short of remarkable. As Slide #4 indicates, underlying underwriting gain in 2013 was almost triple the amount it was in 2011 and demonstrates that we have way more than offset the decline in net investment income resulting from lower investment rates. Second, the impact on product returns, which is what drives us, has been impressive. Slide #5 in the webcast shows a summary analysis of our expected economic product returns and demonstrates that the impact on these returns has been consequential. On the slide, we show our analysis of expected economic product returns on a written business for 2 periods, the outlook for Q1 2013 as of that time and the outlook for Q1 2014. The numbers noted in red indicate the percentage of our aggregate premium from products where the expected economic return on capital allocated to those products is less than 10%. The numbers in black indicate the percentage of our aggregate premiums where expected product returns are in the range of 10% to 20%. And the numbers in blue indicate the percentage of our premiums where expected product returns exceed 20%. The progress, we believe, is quite remarkable. I should note that this analysis does not directly correspond to a GAAP return, and I encourage you to read the important explanatory notes on Slide #6. The significance of this analysis is that the very granular data we review played an important part of our pricing strategy and tactics and it is a critical element of our senior management analysis and review. We all spent a lot of time with it, and it is one of the most important tools. We have been on an analytical journey for a long time and have worked diligently on developing this analysis, and it allows us to be quite surgical in our marketplace strategy. The conclusion to be drawn from the summary analysis is that we've made tremendous progress in driving our returns closer to our long-term targets. However, closer to is not good enough. For those who will consider that this analysis suggests we are finished trying to improve returns, that is just categorically wrong. We will continue to take pricing actions on an account-by-account or class-by-class basis for those accounts or classes of business that continue to be in the poorer performing segments of our portfolio. While after 3 years of pricing actions, considerably more of the portfolio has moved from poorer performing to better performing classes, there is still enough business in the poorer performing classes so that successful pricing actions should continue to result in improved returns. Even for our better performing accounts, we will see great -- equal to or greater than loss trend when appropriate. We remain optimistic that we will be able to continue to execute this strategy successfully. Brian will speak more about rate and will provide some perspective on looking at the data on a segmented basis. And while we can't predict the future, the recent data as well as the most recent anecdotal observations from the field give us confidence that we will be able to continue to execute successfully. We have also been helped in pursuing higher returns by somewhat increased interest rates, and Jay Benet will speak more to that. While we are not explicitly contemplating further meaningful increases in the near-term, in interest rates, that is, we do believe that interest rates will eventually rise from here and will provide further lift to returns. We have commented before that we believe that many industry observers are putting inappropriate significance on the absolute number of rate gain, particularly the headline number that is so often quoted. While the number is interesting, it is not nearly as revealing as many believe, as the rate and retention in a much more granular basis holds the real key to success. It's also worth noting again that we are return-focused, and as long as our risk profile is appropriate, whether in underwriting risk selection or investment selection, we are agnostic about where product returns come from. Our goal remains a simple one, top-tier profitability, and if we generate more capital than is necessary to support our business, returning that capital to our shareholders so as to right size our capital base. To that point, since we started buying back our shares in the middle of 2006, we have returned almost $27 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an amount which is now approaching the market capitalization of the company when we embarked on our active capital management program. The strategy has worked elegantly by producing superior returns, and we remain committed to it. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks, Jay. By any measure, our fourth quarter results: record net income per diluted share of $2.70, record operating income per diluted share of $2.68, operating ROE of 16.8% and a GAAP combined ratio of 87.7%, were very strong. As has been the case all year, these strong results were built upon very solid investment and underwriting performance. Within the investment world, the recent rise in interest rates has lessened the headwinds that we and our industry have been facing due to historically low interest rates. Slide 10 shows how average after-tax yields have increased for the long-term fixed income securities that we actually purchased during each quarter of 2013. For taxable, that increase was approximately 45 basis points from the fourth quarter of last year, while for tax-exempt, the increase was 105 basis points. As we've done periodically, we've included in the appendix to this webcast the schedule showing our current expectations for maturities and calls of our long-term fixed income investments projected over the next 3 years, along with the expected impact on net investment income if reinvestment rates generally remain where they are today. All things being equal, while we still expect that fixed income, net investment income will decrease in the next 3 years, that decrease will be smaller than what we previously expected. Turning to underwriting. We continue to earn rate increase in excess of loss trends in each of our business segments. This drove 130 basis point improvement in our underlying combined ratio in BI as compared to the prior-year quarter, although in PI and in FPII, the benefits from earned rate increases exceeding loss cost trends were more than offset by normal quarterly fluctuations in non-cat weather, fire-related losses and what we define as large loss activity. Pre-tax cat losses were $53 million in the quarter, down dramatically from last year's fourth quarter, which included Storm Sandy, and pre-tax net favorable prior year reserve development remains strong at $259 million. As has been the case throughout the year, each of our business segments contributed to the favorable reserve development, which was driven by BI's general liability product line for accident years 2006 through 2012, FPII's Surety business for accident years 2006 through 2010 and by PI's Homeowners & Other business for both cat losses related to accident year 2012 and liability losses for accident years 2009 through 2012. As I've done in the past, I'd also like to share with you a preliminary view of what our combined 2013 Schedule P is expected to look like when it is filed on May 1. On a combined product basis, all accident years, other than accident year 2012, developed favorably and the unfavorable development for 2012 is truly de minimis. Looking at the data on a product line rather than on an accident year basis, our major product lines developed favorably across all accident years, except for relatively small unfavorable development in Auto liability and CMP. Commercial and Personal Auto liability developed unfavorably by a little over $30 million and $20 million pre-tax, respectively, each having a reserve base of approximately $2 billion, driven mostly by the 2012 accident year, while CMP developed unfavorably by about $60 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $3 billion, and that was spread out over several recent accident years. Of note, workers' comp developed favorably by approximately $85 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $14 billion, even after the $42 million pre-tax charge precipitated by legislation in New York related to the New York Fund for reopened cases for workers' comp that we disclosed in the first quarter and some very minor strengthening of about $60 million pre-tax for a few recent accident years. We continue to generate capital well in excess of what is needed to support our business and, consistent with our strategy, we've continued to return very significant amounts of capital to our shareholders. Operating cash flows were in excess of $900 million this quarter, bringing total operating cash flows to over $3.8 billion for the year. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $1.6 billion after returning almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $182 million and common share repurchases of $1 billion. And for the full year, we returned over $3.1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $734 million and common share repurchases of $2.4 billion. All of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total cap ratio of 21.3 was well within its target range during the quarter. Book value per share increased 3%, and adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, increased 4%. For the full year, book value per share increased 4% and adjusted book value per share increased 12%. The difference between unadjusted and adjusted growth rates was driven by the impact that the recent rise in interest rates have on net unrealized investment gains. Those net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.3 billion after-tax at the end of the year, as compared to $3.1 billion at the beginning of the year. So with that, Brian is now going to provide some further insight into our operating results.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. I'll begin with Business Insurance, which had a very strong fourth quarter, with operating income of $634 million and a combined ratio of 88.9. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, was 91.5 for the quarter, an improvement of more than 1 point year-over-year, and 92.2 for the full year, an improvement of about 2.5 points over full year 2012. As always, there were a lot of moving pieces in the combined ratios. In 2013, large losses were slightly higher, expense items were a net positive and mix changes were a net negative. Excluding these items, the pure margin expansion, that is the impact of rate increases in excess of loss trend, was 2.5 points in the quarter and 2.7 points for the full year. Turning to the top line, we posted record-high net written premium volume for the full year of $12.2 billion. Looking at the production trends underlying the premium volume on Page 13, retention was up slightly from recent periods at 80% while renewal premium change was in line with recent periods at about 8%. The 8% included pure rate increases of about 6%, down about 1 point from the last few quarters. The rate increases continue to be broad-based and were led by Commercial Auto. New business volume in the quarter was $435 million, and for the full year, new business was over $1.8 billion. Loss trend continued to run at about 4% for this segment, so on a written basis, rate gains continued to be significantly above our current view of loss trend. The aggregate production results were strong, but as Jay emphasized in his opening, our focus has always been on returns. And to understand the impact of rate and retention on returns, you have to examine the detail behind how we got to the aggregate results. We've talked before about how we measure our business returns on a very granular basis. By business, by line, by territory, in smaller accounts, by class and in middle and large accounts down to the individual account level. Looking at this data for full year 2013 and the fourth quarter, we're very pleased with our execution. Specifically, retention in our better performing business was very strong, with reasonable rate increases. But our real opportunity is to get significant improvement on our poorer performing accounts. For example, think of the below 10% ROE section on the chart Jay showed on Page 5. Obviously, we're not going to share with the public the full granular detail at all the levels that we manage the business. But we did want to give some insight into our performance, specifically for those poorer performing business. Slide 17 shows the renewal rate change over the last 8 quarters for the poorer performing segmentation bands in our middle-market business, about 20% of our total middle-market premium. And middle-market here includes commercial accounts, construction, technology and our public sector business. Intentionally, we didn't give you specific rate numbers, but they're all well into the double digits. So you can see clearly from this slide that over the last 2 years, we've been able to consistently get meaningful rate increases on the portfolio for poorer performing accounts. Although the rate changes move slightly quarter to quarter, in our view, there doesn't appear to be a clear trend which would signal any real movement in the marketplace. For example, we believe that the fourth quarter 2013 decline in rate and increase in retention is more a function of our execution than a change in the marketplace. And accordingly, we see an opportunity to improve pricing in this book of business in the coming quarters. So the main thing that this data tells us is that, at least through the end of 2013, for the lower returning businesses in our portfolio, our ability to take appropriate pricing and underwriting actions to improve performance in those accounts has not changed significantly in the last 2 years. Not all the segmentation bands have this level of consistency in rate change. But in each band, pricing gains continued to exceed the expected increase in loss cost and we continue to make progress in the accounts with the greatest opportunity to improve returns. The data underneath this graph, along with the other granular analytics we use to manage the business, gives us confidence that throughout 2013, our underwriters continue to execute well on our strategy, making the right targeted decisions, class by class, account by account. As we continue to execute on our strategy of improving returns, if we are successful, the aggregate headline rate will come down over time. The key for us, however, is not the headline number, but instead will always be why our rate and retention numbers are changing regardless of direction and whether these changes are consistent with our goal of generating mid-teens return on equity over time. Turning to our Financial, Professional and International business. Operating income of $171 million for the quarter was up 31% over the prior-year quarter. This increase was driven by a lower level of cat activity in the current quarter, as well as higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying GAAP combined ratio of 94.7 deteriorated 3.2 points over the prior-year quarter due to a higher underlying loss ratio, reflecting a higher level of large losses and non-cat weather-related losses for international, as well as the Dominion acquisition, partially offset by earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was partially offset by a lower expense ratio reflecting the inclusion of the Dominion. Net written premiums were up 29% in the fourth quarter of 2013, driven primarily by the inclusion of the Dominion for 2 months. Management liability premium increased as a result of our decision to discontinue the excess of loss reinsurance treaty for this business. In our Personal Insurance business, operating income was $237 million for the quarter and $838 million for the full year, an almost fourfold increase over full year 2012. A very strong result driven in part by lower catastrophe losses, but also reflective of improvement in our underlying Auto and Homeowner results. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 88.8, up about 2 points over 2012, due to unusually favorable fire and non-cat weather losses in 2012. On a full year basis, the underlying combined ratio of 88.3 improved 2.5 points over 2012 due to pure margin expansion. Looking specifically at Auto production, retention was strong at 81%, renewal premium change was 7% and new business volume was up versus recent periods, while net written premium was down year-over-year. The increase in new business volume was primarily the result of the rollout of our new product, Quantum 2.0. By the end of 2013, we had launched the product in 18 states, and while we are still in the early days of the rollout, we are pleased with our execution so far. To date, in these states, we are achieving the competitive position that we had modeled, both broadly in the marketplace and specifically in the comparative raters. In addition, in these states, our agents have embraced the benefits of the new cost structure and product features. Turning to Auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio was 102.2 for the quarter, an improvement of 3.5 points, and 97.6 for the full year, an improvement of 1.6 points. Earned rate in excess of loss trend contributed about 2 points of improvement for the quarter and about 2.5 points for the full year. Our current view of Auto loss cost trend is about 4%, mix adjusted frequency continued to be benign, while severity trend remains stable at a slightly elevated level. Specifically, bodily injury severity trend this quarter remained in line with what we've seen over the past few quarters. Turning to Homeowners. Production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of 10%, while retention ticked up to 84% and new business volume was up from the prior-year quarter. From a profitability perspective, our full year Agency Homeowners combined ratio was 77%, both on a reported and underlying basis. This outstanding result reflects the long-term strength of this franchise and the impact of the rate and underwriting actions we have taken in the marketplace over the last 2 years. We feel very good about our Homeowners results and the marketplace position of this business. With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Lina, we will now like to open up for question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions] Lina?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I have one on investment income. It ran higher in our model even counting the real estate and private equity partnerships, and you've made an illustration of kind of higher investment yield you've been getting. So I guess the question is were there any other one-timers in the net investment income line this quarter, like prepayments, et cetera, or was this a reflection of what the kind of underlying higher rate environment is helping with?\nWilliam H. Heyman: It's Bill Heyman. There were no one-timers in the fixed income portfolio.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: And where are you seeing -- I guess, where is the sweet spot of where you are investing now, I guess from a rating and new money yield perspective?\nWilliam H. Heyman: I think probably the municipal market. If you look at the differential spreads between book yields expiring and new money, it's closest in municipal. In fact, for a time in the fourth quarter, we were investing even yield with what was expiring, that's fallen off a bit. Generalizing, in order of attractiveness, municipals, corporates, mortgages.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: And the quick follow-up there, is that -- was that attractiveness in the muni market a function of people's expectations of a potential Puerto Rican sovereign default, and is that something that's affecting how you look at the market, and do you guys have exposure there?\nWilliam H. Heyman: Well, in order, it's not really affecting how we look at the market. As far as our exposure, I could go through it in some detail. I wouldn't say it's material. We haven't purchased a Puerto Rican obligation in 12 years and as a legacy portfolio, most is short-term insured or both. But I think Puerto Rico probably did affect the market as a whole. And frankly, speaking selfishly, anything that cheapens the market is good news for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: A question on the capital management outlook for 2014. If I do the quick math on 2013, add up dividends, share repurchase and then I guess M&A funded with cash, it equals about 105% of operating earnings. Should we think about that payout ratio level continuing in 2014 or maybe we should expect a slowdown, I see that exposure growth does seem to be picking up a little bit?\nJay S. Benet: This is Jay Benet. I think in terms of looking forward as it relates to capital management, the absolute level of capital that's needed to fund growth in the business is relatively small. So what we've said in the past is to look at operating earnings as a rough base as to what might be available for capital management activities like share repurchases, subject to what needs to take place with regard to, as we just said, funding the growth of the business, possibly making a contribution to the pension plan. Although I will say our pension plan at the end of the year was overfunded at this point in time. So that doesn't require, in our view, much in a way of funding next year. But it's always subject to all the things that might take place in terms of how the world will change next year. But operating earnings would be the base to look at.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. And lastly, a follow-up. So higher levels of non-cat large and non-cat weather losses appear to have materially impacted 2 of the main segments. I know this is tough to do, but can you help us think about the dynamics like, for example, were the losses a couple of points above historical levels or were they just much higher than prior levels which were very benign?\nBrian W. MacLean: So Mike, this is Brian. For starters, in PI, which I think had the biggest swing, the real driver there was how low the fourth quarter was in non-cat weather in 2012. And so this year was more consistent with kind of a normal run rate level of a non-cat weather. In BI, it was relatively consistent. And in FPII, Alan?\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Mike, it's Alan Schnitzer. In FPII, the small weather and the large losses compared to a very favorable result in the prior year. So that's really driving the difference.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital U.S.A.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: My first question relates to the new slide, Slide #5, and again, this is extremely helpful, the Slide 5 and Slide 17. What I was wondering is, using that Slide 5 as a backdrop, could you sort of help us understand what might be the range of earned rates in those different buckets?\nJay S. Benet: What might be the range of earned rates in those buckets? Yes -- no, I understand. I'm trying to -- I wouldn't know how to answer that actually, because it's aggregated by product, by business.\nGabriella Nawi: This is Gabby. That is -- those are returns on capital, so obviously, it's underlying margin and the investment component on those cash flows.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: What I was trying to understand is...\nJay S. Benet: This is Jay Benet. It is weighted by the premium volumes associated with each one of the businesses. So I think it's a proxy. You could probably look at those weightings as, rough justice, approximately what the earned premiums are. But keep in mind, what Jay said earlier, this is an economic product yield going forward, what the returns are going to look like. This is not a GAAP yield. That's why we're having trouble answering your question. So let me, as a proxy, you can kind of divide the earned premium.\nBrian W. MacLean: Amit, this is Brian. Let me go back, I think -- go back to my comments in the webcast. And you can kind of translate the ROE slide roughly into the poorer performing businesses, obviously, the bottom of the ROE chart and vice versa. And as I said, for the poorer performing accounts, obviously, we've got some that are still well into the 20s, but think solid double-digit rate increases. Now I'm talking written, and you mentioned earned. So I'd have to think through how everything's get earned in. And although there, over the last couple of years, there hasn't been a great volatility. In the better performing businesses, as I've said in the comments, we're still getting rate increases on a written basis that exceed our loss cost growth. So you can kind of approximate what that would be, about the 4 percentage, 3 percentage range. But we -- and then there are other things in between.\nJay S. Fishman: I think this will be our last comment on it, because it's an unusual question. The analysis is our best estimate of the economic capital returns of the products being sold, I'll say, today, but think about it over the next quarter. And so there really isn't much of a rate assumption in terms of change in written rate. It is largely an earned rate embedded in what has already been written and will be earned in the quarter. But it's looking at the returns on a fully discounted basis. And so we're discounting that projected investment income. It is an economic return concept based on allocated capital. But it is, as of today, as of the next 3 months, that's why we say for the quarter.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: No, actually, that color is extremely helpful. But the only other question I have is that of a quick follow-up on the opening comments regarding the modest adverse development in Workers' Compensation. I'm trying to sort of reconcile the $85 million modest development with the growth in that line if I look on -- at page, the level of the supplement, and then the loss cost trends, can be -- can you sort of talk about how do you think about the returns in Workers' Compensation line? And maybe address that development a bit more?\nJay S. Benet: What -- this is Jay Benet. Let me talk about the development for a second. First of all, I do want to correct one thing. Worker's Comp developed favorably this year. It didn't develop unfavorably. What you heard us talk about before is that we have a very, very granular by-business line approach to calculating and evaluating our reserves. So when one of our business units -- and these can be very relatively small business units, says they're seeing a trend, and maybe the trend is they have a few losses that went tabular, that were more than what they expect and, therefore, they feel they should be strengthening their reserves in that business line. That will bubble up through the reserves setting process, so I can't stress enough that when we're talking about a modest increase, it's against a reserve base or -- I'm sorry, a premium base of $3.5 billion in any given year. So I think it's more a function of our businesses looking at things that are taking place, not putting news in a drawer, hoping that it goes away, but just reacting to whatever they currently see. It's not an indication that if you have a negative development in 1 quarter, you're going to get more development of a negative type in the next quarter. It is just the normal variations that we see going forward, and the quarterly reserve settling process. And as I've said, overall, Worker's Comp. developed favorably. And we can see the same thing in all of our lines and in same kind of variation.\nBrian W. MacLean: So just -- and so I'll give you a couple of comments, this is Brian, on the -- from a business perspective how we're feeling about comp. And first of all, I'd say if you're looking at net written premium, the growth in net written premium is because of pricing, primarily rate. So that's been driving the growth there, not necessarily account growth. I'd also say, we understand comps very well. We understand this -- its challenges and its volatility. For the last 2-plus years, it's gotten the strongest rate increases across our portfolio. And I think we've got real competitive advantages there. So it's a state-by-state industry, class-by-class gain, and there are clearly some states and some classes that still need rate improvement, but in the aggregate, we feel very good about the returns.\nJay S. Fishman: I am -- Hi, it's jay Fishman. I misspoke on a comment about that Slide 5. Let me just correct it. I -- I'm told I said it's earned rate. It's not. That's a written rate analysis. It's the price, the rate at which the product is being written today. And so, again, just to correct the record on that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So I do have a question on Dominion. I don't know if it could be possible to know kind of what the underlying was for Dominion in the fourth quarter, I mean what FP&II would've looked like x that. And if you could just talk about the rate -- the actions that you're taking in that book, and whether there are any constraints from a regulatory or other perspective that could impact your ability or will -- that will allow you to push for rates that you need to improve that business?\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Sure. It's Alan Schnitzer. Let me try to take that. In the quarter, actually, the Dominion was all in neutral. It was adverse to the loss ratio, but favorable to the expense ratio, so that sort of netted out. But that was really the result of a couple of, I'll say, unusual things related to the transaction and just as an example, purchase accounting. So I think the way to think about that going forward is, for next year we expect the Dominion to have about a 2-point adverse impact on the overall FP&II combined ratio. Now I'll also say that we expect that to be offset by some other things going on in the segment, so the way to think about the segment for next year is for 2013, we had an underlying combined of about 92, and we're expecting that to be broadly consistent in 2014, so just to put the Dominion in perspective. Certainly, there are -- we're harder at work on that business and trying to bring all the Travelers sophistication and know-how, and working with our FP&II and BI colleagues here in our U.S. based business to try to bring all the Travelers benefits to that business. When you talk about regulatory constraints, you're probably referring to Ontario Auto. That's a fluid situation and, obviously, the regulators in Ontario were looking for some significant rate cuts. But we're also hopeful that, that will be combined with some commensurate reductions in loss cost. So it remains to be seen what the impact would be on the overall margins. But we are quite confident that even though we'll have that 2-point impact in 2014, that all the work that we will bring to that book over time will improve that result, and clearly, we'll evaluate that transaction as it impacts our ROEs for our international business over time, and we remain as optimistic about that today, as we did when we announced the transaction.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. Thanks. And then, I guess, on that front, I mean, did you expect -- anything we can glean from what you expect for on a top line perspective, in terms of how much of the book you expect to keep versus part of the business that may go as a result of the rate gain or the rate action that you take?\nAlan D. Schnitzer: It's right. I understand the question. I think given the size of the transaction and its significance to the segment in the overall business, we're not going to -- we're going to stay away from that level of detail. But I'll try to give you the combined ratio impacts to help you with the modeling as you think about it for next year, but I think, what we're trying to stay away from that level of detail on that side of business.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Great. And then just 1 if I could on the -- on BI. I know that non-cat weather has created some noise in terms of the evaluating the year-over-years over the last couple of quarters. How should we think about the starting point for margins next year when we're comparing to this year, either fourth quarter or for the full year, as we think about the rate actions on a written basis earnings through?\nAlan D. Schnitzer: So first of all, I'd -- you meant Business Insurance there, right?\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Business -- I'm sorry, Business Insurance.\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Yes. I think, well, because in Business Insurance, there really wasn't much of an impact of non-cat weather. Last couple of years were very comfortable. It wasn't exactly the same number, but around it. There wasn't -- when you look at the full year 2013 in Business Insurance, there was a little bit of movement in large losses and mix change. But nothing really material. So that's probably a pretty decent benchmark of run rate, combined ratio or loss ratio. And then you can see our written rate numbers and how they're going to earn in overtime. So I think you can -- as we said, loss trends holding at about 4%. So I think you can kind of do that arithmetic. There isn't a lot of unusual stuff that's really distorting that number this quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: So the first question was just a clarification on the Dominion acquisition. I believe it was mentioned that the acquisition would have a 2-point negative impact on '14 combined ratio. But I still thought that you said that the combined ratio will be flat '14 versus '13?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. That's right. And that's because while the Dominion transaction on itself has about a 2-point adverse impact, there will be other things that we expect to offset that. For example, a change in the reinsurance program in our management liability business, and as earned rate continues -- as written rate from that prior year and this year continues to earn in at a higher level than loss cost, so that margin improvement, together with the reinsurance program, on a segment basis we're talking about, should be about -- on an underlying basis x cats and PYD.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Sure. That's helpful. Okay. And then just looking at the Business Insurance segment. I'm looking at it for this quarter -- that's the fourth quarter. I'm looking at it on an accident year loss ratio x cats. It seems that, that number was relatively flat at about 61.2% this quarter versus the year ago quarter. Just curious, given the rate increases, I would have expected a 3-point improvement year-over-year.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. So in the quarter, there were some moving pieces, and there's always a little bit of weather and a little bit of large losses and a little bit of mix and are you talking this loss ratio, so expenses aren't impacting it. We saw about a 2.5 point, when we net through all of that stuff, the -- what we think of is kind of pure margin, the rate, x earned rate, x net to the loss cost trend was about 2.5 points in the quarter, down a little bit, it was about 2.7 points in the full year.\nJay S. Benet: Yes. One of the other things that's always going to impact the year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter look at the loss ratios, in particular would be mix changes in the business, which -- what products are of higher percentage 1 year versus the next, how much loss sensitive business there is relative to guaranteed cost, so I mean that's also impacting some of the quarterly variations that you're seeing.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay. That's helpful. And just one last question on pricing. I just wanted to get a clarification that you mentioned that the slowdown in rate is not because of market conditions, but more the actions that Travelers is taking and more of your businesses adequately priced. I just want to get a clarification on that?\nBrian W. MacLean: So several comments there. I mean, clearly, in the poor performing business, we feel very good that our ability to get price improvements, terms and conditions, whatever we need to approve the account is pretty consistent with where it has been in the last couple of years. So there, we don't see a lot of -- a lot of market movement.\nJay S. Fishman: And this Jay. To the point that Brian made in his comments, what you'll see in the fourth quarter on that graph is a slight deterioration in rate and an increase in retention in those poor performing classes. So the comments about our own actions is that we would look back on that and say we didn't execute to allow retention to go up and rate to go a tiny bit down, a little bit down, in the poor performing classes. Not perfect, not perfect. It would have been better if we had achieved flat retention and rate have moved differently there. So Brian's comment was more specific to the management of those poor performing classes. The question that I always ask when we're talking about marketplace competitiveness is, do our field underwriters think that if an account in a particular class came up for renewal today versus 1 year ago or 2 years ago, would the opportunity for rate improvement be viewed differently by a field underwriter today than it would have then? And I've asked the question many times in a lot of ways, and the answer that I get routinely is, in the poorer performing classes, no, no difference at all. In the best performing classes, perhaps a little more difficult. Perhaps a little more difficult is quite literally the words that we hear. As we looked at the numbers, our rate gains, even in the best-performing classes, more than offset loss costs. And so that continues to be pretty good. The point about the headline number is that as business moves from poor performing classes to the better performing classes, by definition, the headline number is going to go down. And it would be, I think, inappropriate to make a direct conclusion that, that number going down, therefore means that rate opportunity has peaked. What you're seeing much more is a change of mix within the classes than the ability to get a rate improvement in a particular class. And lastly, Brian mentioned that the poor-performing classes, that graph that's in the materials still represents about 20% of our...\nBrian W. MacLean: Middle-market.\nJay S. Fishman: Middle-market business. So there's not -- it still represents a meaningful portion on which to improve rate. Now, I wish the answer for rate peaking or not peaking was a lot easier to say than that. It's just not. It's a complicated business with a lot of moving parts, different business, different lines, and after 3 years, different levels of profitability. But that's the most fulsome response I think that we can provide.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question then.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: And 2 good new slides this quarter, and I guess just trying to synthesize them. The point you're keen to -- seem to be making is that the mix of accounts sort of how much you need is, you're taking, is stable, but as accounts naturally improve, they're sort of fewer, fewer on which you need to take weight. I guess if we could, just to belabor the point then -- just to set expectations for headline run rates, though. Should we as investors expect them to continue this sort of this slow downward trajectory into 2014 or -- 2013 was reasonably stable for most of the year after you guys sort of set a trajectory at the end of 2012. And I'm wondering, if you think it's going to look more like last year, or if the recent trend for the next -- for the past quarter or 2 is likely to persist, of pricing slowing as we work our way through the year?\nJay S. Fishman: I think it's very difficult for us to project in the short term, because it's a function of which accounts in particular come up for renewal in a given quarter. So it's difficult to compare a third quarter to a fourth quarter or a fourth quarter to a first. They're not the same accounts. It's a different batch. So in the short-term, I'd -- we would struggle to answer that. We just don't have the insight that I think you all think that we do. In the longer-term, if we continue to be successful, I would say with certainty the headline number will continue to go down. As accounts move into our best-performing business, our goal changes to the highest retention possible consistent with maintaining margin. That's very, very different than the philosophy in the poor performing accounts where lower retention, if we're unable to achieve meaningful rate gains, is just fine. Our goal is always to improve product returns. And once accounts get into a range that are consistent with the highest levels of profitability in our industry, we begin to move much more to retention. And so if we're successful, my expectation is that our retention will slowly tick up over time, again, I'm not speaking about quarter-to-quarter because the mix will change, and that the headline rate number will continue to come down over time. If it doesn't, there's really something that we're executing that's not quite right. Now, again, quarter-to-quarter because the accounts themselves are different, not nearly as predictable, but as an overall trend, that's really is -- that's the way that we look to the business.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: Great. So, if I ask if one kind of final question, growth. You guys are starting to get some results from Quantum, separately, it looks like in a commercial lines business, you might be seeing significant growth in the targeted risk section a bit. I'm interested in your thoughts of both in sort of success of Quantum and maybe more qualitatively what agents are really -- sort of what sort of feedback you're really getting from agents, as well as if there's anything that we should be inferring from sort of rising growth in a couple of your smaller Business Insurance lines?\nJay S. Fishman: It's Jay Fishman. I'll start with Quantum, and I'll ask Gregory Toczydlowski to chime in and provide perspective, and then I think we'll look to Brian for comments and Bill come in as well on Business Insurance. Our goal in Quantum, remember we shared with you that we had back tested it and had a view of how the product would be positioned in the comparative rating engines, our goal was to achieve a meaningful improvement in its positioning in those comparative raters. That doesn't mean a reduction in profitability because of cutting price, you got to absolutely remember that Quantum's premise is a lower cost, lower commissioned product and, therefore, could support the same returns at a lower price. That's the entire philosophy of it. As of year-end, we were in 18 states. The -- we do know, were it's positioned in the comparative rater. We get the data. And its positioning so far is consistent with our back testing modeling. It is doing, from a comparative rating positioning, just what we had hoped it would. Now, no idea what competitor reaction will be perspectively, or what will happen. Our goal initially was to do the analysis thoughtfully and see that we have the product positioned in the comparative rating engine correctly, and the price was what we had contemplated it would be. In that regard, so far, so good. It, obviously, you don't get -- we have an analysis, an assumption of loss content. We will find out as losses begin to develop, how good that is. We don't have a point of view, or view on that yet other than the analytics that we did when we developed Quantum 2.0. So we're not yet declaring victory that the underwriting margins coming from it will be consistent with what we modeled. We're hopeful. We will know more of that relatively soon, I suspect over the next, I don't know Greg, a couple few quarters we'll begin to have a view on the loss content. In terms of agent react -- why don't you, one of you go through the agent reaction, anything else you want about that.\nJay S. Benet: Yes. I think just as you said, the agent reaction has been very positive. We're 3 months in to the big wave that went out in October and we're actually not surprised on that. We have a lot of co-development with the agents that were right here in Hartford in helping us to design the structure, the features of it, and so we got a lot of feedback from them in helping build the product. And the 2-key metrics we're watching right now are we seeing an increase in flow, the amount of at bats or quotes and we are seeing that. And then the actual success of our competitive position of those quotes that we're seeing a meaningful uptick there. So when we put both of those together, we're very encouraged and as Jay said, the loss experience will be the third leg of the stool, that we're not waiting for a full loss ratio to develop. We're spending a lot of time looking at surrogates or leading indicators, including the profile of the business. And again, we're encouraged on that. So across-the-board, we're going to continue rolling it out with the same level of discipline and we are very enthusiastic as we do that.\nBrian W. MacLean: On the BI front, as Jay mentioned as, were about returns and as returns improve, we're going to be more interested in retaining more business and we feel good that we had record net written premium in BI. It is clearly being driven primarily by pricing actions. Independent of price, there are a lot of things that we're doing to leverage competitive advantages and various strategic initiatives to grow and we've got a lot of that. The thing that we won't be doing is trying to grow through playing a price game. So we're not going to run a sale in the hopes of increasing our market share at the expense of returns, so.\nJay S. Fishman: I think that's important. The questions that we get on many of these calls seem to center on the impact of pricing and growth. We do have a series of initiatives in our Business Insurance segment that are designed to produce growth, including in 1 case, more salespeople. And hopefully, it actually turns around and has an impact, but we will find out. Because we have a disciplined view of price, doesn't mean that we refuse to think of, or abdicate responsibility for finding growth opportunities that are there by product, by people, by expertise, by underwriting skill, and we remain committed to that. As a business that generates 20-odd-plus billion dollars of premium a year, it's a challenge to generate numbers that are consequential in the total. But it doesn't mean that are -- we don't have serious effort and work to try to find those opportunities. We do.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: On the explanatory notes, on the expected economic return table, you talked about $2.5 billion of statutory surplus that was not allocated in this analysis. Should we think of that as excess surplus? Or if not, why wasn't it allocated?\nJay S. Benet: Jay, this is Jay Benet. First of all, there is some fluidity in what the statutory surplus balance is going to look like each quarter, because we have earnings and those earnings will get dividended up to the holding company. So that's part of it. But we also have, as you know, asbestos and environmental reserves and some other runoff businesses, so there's capital that supports that as well. So what we've done in this model is we've allocated all the capital that supports what we've referred to as The Business, to those -- to the products associated with the business. So we think it's a -- in that regard, a full allocation of the capital that we have for the businesses.\nJay S. Fishman: And the majority that is not allocated is attributable to what we also would call these runoff businesses, meaning specifically asbestos, environmental and such.\nOperator: And we have a question coming from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: A couple of quick ones here. First, can we chat a little bit about the Homeowners Insurance business? It looks like your underlying combined are in pretty good shape there. And I guess my question is, what point do you think you're going into pull back on some of the rate that you're getting in Homeowners, and maybe, to potentially look to grow that line of business? And could that help at all with some of the Auto insurance growth?\nBrian W. MacLean: So, Brian, this is Brian MacLean. The -- clearly, the Homeowners combined on a -- on any basis you look at it, we feel very good. There's obviously been a huge story of weather volatility that we're still -- so there's still a decent number of places around the country that we are still taking some underwriting actions and looking at managing that. Broadly speaking, you can look at our rate filings and see that our rate there is tempering a bit. But in the aggregate, still haven't a need. We do expect that we will get some lift through the Quantum product. We are very much an account-focused personal lines company. So we sell more combined Auto and Home than any of the other major competitors. And so we should be getting a lift as our Auto product moves out into the marketplace and get some of the traction that we were talking about before.\nJay S. Fishman: And I'd love Greg [ph] to comment on -- I'd just make an observation, we take it for granted. Our pricing, terms and conditions profile in Homeowners is not anecdotally driven. Right? It's not as if it's instinctive. We're basing it on the data and the information that we have.\nUnknown Executive: Yes. And as Brian said, that really does have a local story underneath that. When you're following the perils across that product line. So as Brian said, based on some of the weather trends and the perils, we've got various strategies across the country right now.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then my second question just quickly here, on Business Insurance and FP&II, are you seeing any loosening at all in terms on [ph] conditions and from a competitive landscape out there, anything that we should be concerned about as investors?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. In the aggregate, no. And that's something we're put [indiscernible] encouraged with, so we feel good about that.\nGabriella Nawi: And this will be our last question for today.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: I have 2 questions. The first is, so far in the first quarter, there's been some pretty severe freezing temperatures. I'm just wondering if that could lead to elevated non-cat weather from things like burst pipes in the first quarter.\nBrian W. MacLean: I think, Jay, the honest answer is it's too soon to tell. But no question, when you get the severe temperature changes that you get, we get claim activity from that and we've seen some of that. We can't really assess the magnitude of it and forecast here in Northeast is another round in the next couple of days. So we will watch it. But -- and it's actually maybe less about the Northeast and more about when you get those severe temperatures in mid-Atlantic and down south, where you really start having some challenges. But there will be claim activity coming. There is claim activity coming out of it, but we don't -- we haven't scoped it.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: And the second one, on a broader issue, as the economy recovers, we're seeing the benefit of increased exposure growth, but I think there's also the looming issue of potential increase loss cost inflation, both on frequency and severity. So when you talk about is -- 4% for baseline loss cost inflation and Business Insurance, to what extent could we see that move up as the economy recovers?\nBrian W. MacLean: So I think, again, this is Brian, Jay. Things we worry about all the time, we are seeing a little bit of exposure movement from a positive kind of GL and comp driven, which are good things. Nothing dramatic. But there's a little bit of movement there.\nJay S. Fishman: Good news.\nBrian W. MacLean: It's quite positive news, right. And on the -- so supporting your comment about signs of some economic growth, we -- all I can tell you is we obsess over looking at every metric we can about what's going on in loss trend, and we continue to be encouraged that we're not seeing anything out of pattern, that probably the biggest thing that we look at that we've been talking about for years now is the Auto BI trend, bodily injury trends, and -- across all of our businesses. And that continues to run at elevated level, but it hasn't been getting worse in the last several quarters, so -- but we look at it closely.\nJay S. Fishman: And I think that it\u2019s -- we still far fear to say, broadly speaking, I'm not speaking about the insurance industry now or us [ph], but broadly speaking, there remains not yet a meaningful change. In fact, but argue there isn't any change in actual inflation, at least by the traditional measures by which it's reported. We pay a lot of attention. We read everything we can. But it\u2019s very much kind of an outlook question, and who the heck knows. I think it's the answer there.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: As long as overall economic inflation remains benign, should that be a pretty decent indicator on loss cost inflation if you boil it down?\nJay S. Fishman: I think we have -- I think the property-casualty industry has some specific areas where we have a little bit of, what I'd call, inflation concentration dynamics. So wage inflation as it relates to Workers' Comp, medical inflation as it relates to Workers' Comp. Tort inflation as it relates to general liability. Building products as it relates to Homeowners and to some extent, Select. Like, we're not about food, we're not about energy, really, there are some pockets that are more relevant to our loss cost trends than the basket kind of dynamics that you'd pick up from traditional economics. So we rely pretty heavily on our own look, our own ability to look at the data, the actual data, the emerging data on those areas that affect us, and look, you can speculate on a lot of things. You can speculate that perhaps medical inflation will actually continue to decline. I don't know, you could also speculate that it will go up. There certainly more than enough economists who share an equal number of views on that. The tort environment takes a long time to change. Things don't change so quickly in that regard. So while it's always on our minds, because it's important for us, it's not something that, that's going -- I don't -- we don't think -- I don't think personally, in my point of view, that it will be something that will occur quickly, or be a great surprise when it occurs. It will begin to evidence itself slowly, and I hope that we'll see it and be able to react from a pricing standpoint with respect to it. Now I could always be wrong, it might not be the right assessment, but that's how we think about it.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you all for joining us today.

Welcome to the third quarter results teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, October 22, 2013. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may now begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Tina. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks and responses to questions, we may make mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay S. Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our financial results this quarter were really strong. We posted quarterly operating income of $883 million, a 15.2% operating return on equity and record quarterly operating income per diluted share of $2.35. Net income was $864 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, producing a 13.9% return on equity. In the quarter, we returned nearly $1 billion of capital to shareholders, continuing to deliver on our long-term financial goal of producing strong profitability and returning excess capital to shareholders. While the current quarter certainly benefited from low weather-related losses, most importantly our underlying underwriting profitability continued to improve across our businesses, largely the result of the successful execution of the pricing and underwriting actions we have been pursuing over the last several years. While we are really pleased with our financial results not just in the current quarter or year-to-date but over now more than 5 years, we continue to expect to be confronted with more volatile weather patterns and historically low interest rates. As it relates to weather, notwithstanding the fact that in this quarter we had very low catastrophe losses, on a year-to-date basis, our pre-tax cat losses now stand at nearly $540 million. To put that in perspective, that number, again a 9-month figure with a fairly benign third quarter, approaches the $600 million of catastrophe losses that we provided at the end of 2009 in connection with our full year 2010 guidance. It is worth noting that over that period of time, we believe that our catastrophe exposure has not changed meaningfully, but losses have risen as a result of increased frequency and severity of weather events. An interesting way of observing this phenomena is through the data on Slide 4 of our webcast where we have displayed the number of extreme weather events with economic losses over $1 billion by year over the last 30-plus years. While this data does adjust losses for inflation, it does not take into account exposure growth over time. Nonetheless, it is hard not to take notice of the trend. We, of course, evaluate weather over the long term and continue to believe that more recent weather patterns are different and cause us to anticipate higher levels of frequency and severity of weather-related losses. As to fixed-income yields, we continue to believe that interest rates will remain at historically low levels, at least until 2016. Although the long end of the yield curve has moved somewhat, it is not yet enough to make a difference in the return profile of our business in any significant way. Total yields remain just off historical lows. Consequently, in our commercial lines businesses, we will continue to pursue improved profitability and product returns by seeking higher rates on an account by account basis so as to continue to minimize disruption to our agents and customers. So far, this strategy has worked exceptionally well, and we expect that at least for some time across our portfolio, we will be able to continue to achieve written rate gains in excess of estimated loss trend. In Personal Insurance, we're excited about the launch of our new product, Quantum 2.0, during the fourth quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this lower cost, lower-priced Auto insurance product will allow us to improve volumes at attractive returns. We will know more as we get into 2014. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thank you, Jay. Let me begin by saying that our third quarter results, operating income of $2.35 per diluted share, a record level, and operating ROE of 15.2%, were very strong, having benefited from solid investment and underwriting performance. Our combined ratio of 88.9% was also very strong, reflecting earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends in each of our business segments, a relatively low level of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses and $158 million of net favorable prior year reserve development, which was net of an increase to our asbestos reserves. As has been the case in recent periods while the underlying asbestos environment has remained essentially unchanged, payment trends have been moderately higher than what we had expected. For the quarter, excluding the asbestos provision, which, in a 10-year table, would be included in the prior to 2004 accident year row, each accident year developed favorably, and each product line developed favorably or was essentially unchanged. We continue to generate capital in excess of what is needed to support our businesses, and, consistent with our strategy, we have returned a very significant amount of capital to our shareholders. Operating cash flows in excess of $1.6 billion were extremely strong this quarter, bringing total operating cash flows to almost $2.9 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion after returning almost $1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $185 million and common share repurchases of $800 million. Year-to-date, we returned almost $2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $552 million and common share repurchases of $1.4 billion, leaving us with only $759 million remaining under previous share repurchase authorizations as of the end of the third quarter. Since we may exhaust this amount before the end of the year, as announced today our Board of Directors authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases. All of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total cap ratio of 21.4% was well within its target range, although up slightly in the quarter due to our successfully issuing $500 million of 30-year, 4.6% senior debt at the end of July. Book value per share increased 2%, and adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, increased 3% during the quarter. While year-to-date, book value per share increased 1%, and adjusted book value per share increased 8%. The difference between the unadjusted and adjusted year-to-date growth rates in book value per share was driven by the impact that the recent rise in interest rates had on net unrealized investment gains. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter as compared to $3.1 billion at the beginning of the year. So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian, who's going to comment further on operating results.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. In Business Insurance, we had a great quarter with operating income of $526 million and a combined ratio of 93%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, improved by about 1 point year-over-year and reflected about 2.5 points of margin expansion due to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends. When comparing the combined ratios quarter-over-quarter, any one quarter can be lumpy. This quarter, the comparison was negatively impacted by an unusually low level of non-cat, weather-related losses in the third quarter 1 year ago and, to a lesser extent, a couple of non-run rate adjustments that helped last year's combined ratio. On a year-to-date basis, the underlying combined ratio improved nearly 3 points due primarily to the earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends, and this is a better indicator of how the business is performing. Looking at the production results for the segment on Page 10, retention and renewal premium change remained strong and in line with recent periods at 80% and 9%, respectively, while new business volume was up slightly versus the prior year. The renewal premium change was driven by pure rate increases of 7.1% and exposure and other of about 2%. Rate increases continued to be broad based and range from 6% to 10% across all lines, led by Commercial Auto and Worker's Compensation. So in the aggregate, the production metrics in the quarter were very stable across the segment, and we continue to be pleased with this result. But as we've emphasized in the past, the detail behind how we got to the aggregate result is what's really important, and we remain very pleased with our granular execution as well. The segmented rate and retention results remain largely consistent with what we've discussed in prior quarters. For our best-performing business, retention remained very high with written rate gains exceeding loss trend, while we continue to get significant rate increases on our poor-performing accounts. So overall, a great story in the segment. We saw meaningful underlying underwriting margin expansion due to earned rate gains that continued to significantly exceed the loss trend, which remained consistent at approximately 4%. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our strategy of improving returns by maximizing the rate and retention trade-off at a very granular level. In Financial, Professional & International Insurance, operating income of $160 million was very strong, though down 11% from last year. The prior year quarter benefited from a particularly low level of large losses, which, along with year-over-year lower net favorable prior year reserve development, drove the decrease. Similarly, the underlying combined ratio of 92.5% deteriorated by 1.1 points due to the higher level of large losses in the third quarter of 2013, largely offset by earned rate that exceeded loss cost trend in both our bond and financial products and international businesses. Written premiums in this segment were up 6% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by continued favorable rate in Management Liability, strong construction surety results and higher new business in International. In Personal Insurance, operating income of $262 million was up 27% versus the third quarter of 2012, while the underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved nearly 6 points year-over-year, driven by lower weather-related losses along with nearly 2 points attributable to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends. Looking specifically at Auto production, retention of 81% kicked up from recent periods, renewal premium change was over 7%, while new business volumes and net written premiums were down year-over-year. Turning to Auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 97.6% was an improvement of 0.5 point versus the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio improved about 1.5 points, primarily reflecting earned rates that exceeded loss cost trend, while the expense ratio was up about 1 point due to some unusual items, including a charge related to the expense action we discussed last quarter. Excluding the impact of these items, the expense ratio would have been about flat quarter-over-quarter. Auto loss cost trends remain stable at about 5% overall, mix-adjusted frequency continue to be benign, while severity trend remain stable at a slightly elevated level. Specifically, bodily injury severity trend this quarter remained in line with what we've seen over the past few quarters. I'd like to take a moment to talk about Quantum 2.0, our new Auto product which we began rolling out this week and will be rolling out in approximately 15 states during the fourth quarter. Our goal is to offer a lower cost, highly sophisticated and segmented auto product that successfully competes in the marketplace and generates an appropriate return. Quantum 2.0 helps us to achieve that goal by leveraging 8 years of data and experience from Quantum 1.0 to create a more granular and highly segmented product. It will also benefit from a significantly lower cost structure, thanks to both the expense reduction that we announced last quarter, along with a base commission rate that is approximately 2 points slower than Quantum 1.0. When fully realized, the combined impact of these savings will be about a 12% reduction in the non-loss cost base for the product. So a significant impact. We're very excited about this product. We believe that Quantum 2.0 will allow us to improve our competitive position, drive increased business volumes and deliver improved returns. Turning to Homeowners, pricing was also very strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of 11%, retention stable at 83% and new business volume that was up slightly from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio for Home was 71.6% in the quarter, an improvement of over 7 points year-over-year. The primary driver of the improvement was lower non-cat, weather-related losses, but we also saw over 1 point of improvement due to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trend. So a very strong underwriting result for the segmented in the quarter as we continue to see the positive impact of the underwriting and pricing actions we've taken. With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Tina, we're ready for the question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tina?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Randy Binner of FBR.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: I wanted just to go to Page 10. And given that there's so much kind of focus on the red line there, the renewal rate change, I wanted to understand why the previous historical numbers in that chart can kind of adjust down a little bit each time we see this presentation. What drives kind of a revision to those prior quarter numbers each time you update this illustration?\nJay S. Fishman: Right, Randy, this is Jay Fishman. I'll start, and then I'll have Brian chime in as well. First, to your -- we enter into a month's production period. Policies renew, policies don't renew. But it doesn't end as of the reporting date. There can be transactions, cancellations, endorsements, changes in pricing even that occur after the reporting date. So we're always going back and making not adjustments but truing up the reported numbers to what the most recent data actually is. Now I'd make a point that the rate change, the rate change actually is far less than the exposure change will be in a given period. Exposure has audit adjustments embedded in it and, as a consequence, as those are reflected, they will have more change. The rate change, if you look back, has actually been relatively modest and generally is a result of cancellations, early cancellations midterms or other endorsements. But I'll ask Brian to chime in a little, too.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. And one of the things I'll just emphasize is that at the top of the page, it says, \"Illustrative Business Statistics.\" So this isn't an accounting number that's getting booked into the financials. This is us looking at our written production results. And it's -- but it's exactly what Jay just said. When we close the books at a given period of time, we try to make our best assessment of what the production is going to be, but there's also always movement in the accounts. And the adjustments tend to be fairly consistent, but they move around. I don't know, Bill, any -- yes.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Just one quick follow-up. And I appreciate that you think that the market's focus on this is too myopic, but I guess relative to the number of 7.2% that you gave at Barclays versus 7.1% now. Is it more just kind of the chatter of those adjustments that Jay mentioned? Or was there actually kind of a lower rate in that last month for the quarter?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, the Barclays number was a 2-month number. At least it was as of whatever date that conference was. This is obviously the full quarter. What I don't know is, if we had updated those 2-month numbers, whether they would have reflected any change for midterm cancellations or endorsements. So I honestly don't know, and I agree with your assessment that you're looking at it too myopically. I don't know the answer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: In the Business Insurance segment, the underlying loss ratio, not the combined ratio, it looks to have incrementally deteriorated year-over-year. I would have thought it would have improved given pricing continued to trend in the high single digits. I know high or non-cat weather losses were cited. So is that the main culprit? Or are loss cost inflation rates creeping higher as well?\nBrian W. MacLean: So this is Brian and then I'll let Jay Benet comment. But no, loss cost trends are not creeping. They've remained really flat at right around 4%. Obviously, little pieces move up and down, but the overall loss trend has been very, very consistent. The biggest driver in there is the non-cat weather. Jay, I don't know if you want to go through more of the detail, but that's the biggest change that flows through that.\nJay S. Benet: Yes. No, I would add only a little bit to what Brian said. I mean, if you're looking at quarter-to-quarter comparisons, you're always going to see some variances associated with things like non-cat weather impacting the data, which is why in Brian's comments he really provides the information as to what underlying is -- underlying the underlying loss ratio is taking place with regard to the margin expansion relative to earned pricing versus loss trend.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. And then lastly, could you update us on the gap between the new money yields and the existing portfolio yield? And I ask because the fixed-income portfolio yield has actually been steady for 3 sequential quarters now.\nWilliam H. Heyman: Well, the gap is -- there still is a gap between new money yields and...\nJay S. Fishman: By the way, this is Bill Heyman speaking.\nWilliam H. Heyman: Oh, hi. Sorry, yes. And yields on securities which are maturing. It's closing. It depends on which asset class you're looking at, corporates and municipals. But in -- let's take long-term municipals. The raw yield, which is an after-tax yield, of new money is still probably 0.4% lower than what is maturing.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, so the fixed-income portfolio stayed steady, though, in recent quarters. Is that just due to some nuances in the portfolio?\nWilliam H. Heyman: I think the -- I mean, we analyze the change in the book yield of the portfolio to the basis point every quarter, and the change in the first 9 months of this year was 11 basis points. Now in terms of the raw returns from the portfolio, that doesn't really amount to much.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, and this is Jay Benet. Just -- let me just add a couple of points. If you look in our -- in the Outlook section of the 10-Q, we are projecting about a $25 million-per-quarter drag on earnings associated with the reinvestment of the portfolio -- pieces of the portfolio that are maturing at the lower rates. And I think part of what you're seeing or not seeing is the impact of just rounding to the nearest tenth as opposed to going out further when you look at those yields.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: For the $5 billion share repurchase authorization, if I think about for 2013, the company is essentially running at an annualized retained earnings less shareholder dividend pace of around $2.5 billion annually. So based on that, should we assume that, that buyback could take place of around 2 years?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, we've been saying for the last several years, Jay, now that return of capital is ultimately going to be tied to earnings. And so it really is a question of weather and catastrophe losses and all of the various elements. You pick the earnings -- and by the way, Jay always reminds me that we always need to take into account dollars to make pension contributions if necessary or to pay off maturing obligations that we might want to -- might not want to refinance...\nJay S. Benet: Essentially to support the growth of the business.\nJay S. Fishman: Support the growth of the business. So there's always an additional call. But you figure the earnings, divide that into 5, whatever the number is, it's probably not an unreasonable assumption. Include dividends when you do that, by the way.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Okay. And then that $5 billion authorization, given the magnitude of that potential buyback, it appears that signals a strong degree of confidence in your overall reserve position?\nJay S. Benet: Our reserve position is always our best estimate of what our reserves should be, and I think you can see how the reserves have been playing out over the last many years.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Right, okay. And then any thoughts you'd like to provide on the proposed accounting changes from FASB on GAAP for insurance companies given that they could be substantial in terms of the -- and also somewhat adverse relative to how insurers present their financial positions?\nJay S. Fishman: We'll always do what regulators ask us to do. And however we're asked to report, we'll report. We don't have a view. We follow directions.\nJay S. Benet: Okay, and if I can add a couple of things to that. Certainly, we are always very compliant. This is a draft that's been issued. And like other companies, we are responding to the draft, talking to the FASB about what we think is good about it and suggesting areas to be improved.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just one question in BI. It looks like property grew the most this quarter. It hasn't happened for a while in terms of year-over-year premium growth. Just trying to understand. Given that, that doesn't appear where pricing is best, is that a deliberate area of growth for you? Are you seeing exposure growth? Or is that just -- or is that new business? Just a little context on that would be great.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. So this is Brian. So if you really get underneath what's driving the growth in premium, it's very strong retention and it's pricing. So we're not growing our risk count there anything dramatically. And in fact, our overall pricing in the property line, our results throughout this year have been strong and actually a little bit ahead of what the total BI average is. So retention is very strong, pricing has been solid and we feel good about it, so.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Okay. And then I guess the year-over-year has been a bit of a focus in BI in terms of the margin. You cited non-cat weather there being a contributor. It sounds like it went the other way in Homeowners. But I guess the question is, is the fourth quarter -- what's the setup for the fourth quarter? Just given that the sequential -- the comp averages improved sequentially in fourth quarter versus third quarter last year. Is it going to be tough comps again because of non-cat weather in 4Q?\nBrian W. MacLean: Well, let me go back and just clarify the non-cat weather story across the place. So it was, from a meteorological perspective, a light weather quarter. That came through very clearly in Personal lines. In Business Insurance last year, we had an adjustment that we put through in the third quarter to our current year prior quarter property loss pick last year in the third quarter, and it was a light weather quarter in BI. Remembering that Business Insurance is always going to have a little more volatility to the actual losses you could get from an event, you can have large exposures in one year. You have an event, you don't get hit. In the next year, you have one. So that's just to clarify what sounds like a difference in weather patterns between our segments. The bigger story last -- was -- in BI was the last year number was so low. The fourth quarter, I think, we're -- I don't know, Jay. We -- we're not going to get into projecting what we see. Through -- broadly speaking, the thing I would emphasize is the year-to-date, we continue to see something like 2.5, 3 points of margin expansion running through the underlying combined ratio and expect that for the full year, we're going to be somewhere around 2.5 points of margin expansion. So that's, I think, the -- what we're still looking for. And then the results in the quarter will be what they are.\nJay S. Fishman: Particularly, weather.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. that's right.\nOperator: And our next version comes from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I wanted to just follow up on the Quantum 2.0 initiative. You mentioned it's being rolled out in the fourth quarter in 15 states. Can you talk about the average price decline? I mean -- or have you filed yet? And can you talk about how that's going to impact pricing in those 15 states?\nGregory C. Toczydlowski: Sure, Greg. This is Greg Toczydlowski. We look at Quantum on a state-by-state rollout basis. Brian referenced some of the expense reductions across the non-loss component of the business at the minus 12. If you think of that across the country, that's somewhere in the minus 10 to minus 13 range from a pricing perspective or the lower price of Quantum 2.0. Of course, that will vary at a very local territory level. But in aggregate, that's a good sense for you to understand what the pricing disparity will be.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. And specifically, you asked have we filed. We're in the process of doing that. So as we roll out states, obviously -- obviously we've filed in a lot of places. And as we get the approvals, we're rolling out. And our plan is that by the end of June, by the end of the second quarter next year, we will essentially be fully rolled out, which means that there will always be those few states where we have a kind of a unique regulatory environment and work with a different product.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, that's very clear. So just to come back, so the average price decline for this product versus before is 10% -- so this is 10% cheaper to your clients then than what they were getting before, is it? Nationwide by June, that's what you're going to have on the shelf?\nGregory C. Toczydlowski: That's correct, Greg. And again, that's a generalization. All states have variations, but that's kind of the high-level math.\nJay S. Fishman: And Greg, I'd make just 2 points. First, that is literally across the entire book. So you will find we have prices -- we showed you a graph previously, we have prices in 2.0 that are higher than 1.0, and we have prices in 2.0 that are considerably down more than 10%. I would draw your attention back to last quarter, the webcast where we gave you that...\nGabriella Nawi: The chart.\nJay S. Fishman: That spot diagram...\nGabriella Nawi: Yes.\nJay S. Fishman: That we have out there...\nBrian W. MacLean: The Barclays presentation.\nJay S. Fishman: The Barclays presentation. But that's -- so it's important to remember that it's a big divergence. It's not 10% for every account. Plus, we really don't know how quickly the renewal book will move over to -- so this is -- it's new only, but at -- available to agents for renewal business where they opt for it. We just don't know yet how quickly that renewal book will roll over either, so we're in a wait-and-see pattern there as well.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Understood, understood. And what are you doing on the Homeowners side? Will Quantum pick up Homeowners business at all? Does it focus on Homeowners? Or what will you be doing there?\nBrian W. MacLean: Well, the Quantum product is purely an Auto product. The majority of our business is account business, though, however. So we believe we will absolutely see a lift in the Homeowners production side as we roll out a more competitive Auto product.\nJay S. Fishman: And I'd make the observation that the decline in policies in force in the Homeowners book is meaningfully tilted towards catastrophe-focused areas where losses have been more challenging in the context of a changing weather environment. It's being driven by higher deductibles, higher pricing, but it's not -- meaning it's not uniquely a pricing issue in Homeowners. It's also a catastrophe management dynamic that sits around it. We were hopeful that it wouldn't have had as much decline as it has had, but it is what it is and we're going to price for catastrophes appropriately and manage our book accordingly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: So just to follow up on the last question on Quantum 2.0. If the pricing changes approximately 10%, how should we think about sort of a commensurate impact on margins?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, so this is Brian again, and [indiscernible]. But we are targeting the same returns on this product that we do in our overall business. So as we look at the expense actions we're taking and the underwriting and risk selection that we're refining on the product side, we -- that'll be partly driven back to the consumer in lower prices and partly driven to ensuring appropriate margins. We're looking at both -- accomplishing both objectives. But the fundamental target returns on the business have not changed.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: And what...\nJay S. Fishman: We may experience -- it's entirely possible that we may experience in the early days of Quantum 2.0 a return that is lower. There is -- I don't like the term because it's often confused. There is a new business penalty. It's not a premium penalty. We don't charge less for the product new than renewal, but there is a loss dynamic that takes some time to sort out in the underwriting profile. So it's very possible in the early days that the returns may not be at the level that we'd like them to be. We fully anticipate that, and we'll manage the book accordingly as we make adjustments. But Brian's point about not -- about having it priced to be the same return over time is exactly right.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Okay, that's helpful. The only other question I have is, I guess, going back to Slide 10. Has the source of new business changed? I guess what would be helpful is, is it coming from issues at your competitors? Is it a function of the economy? Or is it new niches?\nGabriella Nawi: Yes.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes.\nGabriella Nawi: Sorry, Amit. Just to clarify it, when you're saying Slide 10, are you asking about the new business dollar amounts? Are you asking about... .\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Yes, the source of the new business on Slide 10. Has it changed over the past few quarters? Or has the mix changed? I guess that's what I'm asking.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, I would say the short answer to that is no. There hasn't been any fundamental shifts in where we're getting our new business from and lines of business and industries, et cetera, so.\nJay S. Fishman: Over a longer period of time, there has been some shift in lines. But in the context of the last several quarters, no.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: The first question is on the Quantum 2.0 product. I believe you're rolling it out this quarter. What are the indications right now you are getting from the agents on the new business side from that product?\nJay S. Fishman: We don't -- it's just -- it -- we don't have any yet, really. It's just too early.\nBrian W. MacLean: I mean, literally, we just started rolling out this past weekend.\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, in 2 states.\nBrian W. MacLean: So we're out, like, 3 days. And so it's a handful of states so far. And like we said, it'll be 15 or so by the end of the quarter. We will, in the next coming weeks, begin to get a better answer to that.\nVinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division: Okay, that's helpful. The second question was on the Select Accounts in that -- on Slide 11. The new business dropped off a little bit there. Just curious about the pushback you're getting from your clients because it seems that we might be running into headwinds in terms of the amount of rate increases you can get on that business. So I'm just curious about your strategy in this line.\nBrian W. MacLean: And so Select Accounts -- and I think we've mentioned this on previous calls or at least, I think, the last call actually. Select was an area -- first of all, we think of that business as the Express world of the really small accounts and then Plus, Express being a little bit more than half of our portfolio. And that's an area where, going back a couple of years ago, we felt the returns in that business were very challenged. We were fairly aggressive in what we were doing from a pricing perspective. We feel better about the returns in the Express world now, and that is one where we are starting to shift our strategy to wanting to, first and foremost, retain more of that book. And then we'll see where the new business appetite goes. But...\nJay S. Fishman: I'd make just 2 other observations. First, retention in the line has been absolutely consistent. So there's -- notwithstanding renewal rate change, that's been in those -- in that high 6 area. Retention has been absolutely solid. And the difference between $97 million of new business and $89 million in the third quarter of this year versus third quarter of last, those are pretty small numbers. I -- there isn't anything that we've seen that would suggest any fundamental shift any real change going on in Select relative to the pricing environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.\nJoshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: On personal auto, the nonrenewals compared -- or at least the -- policy counts down 12% from 1 year ago, and you have 9% to 10% rate increases. I would think the margin improvement would be better that you're weeding out the unprofitable drivers, getting great increases on the newer drivers. When do we have to wait for this to come through?\nBrian W. MacLean: Josh, this is Brian. The first thing I would say is we've talked a good bit over the last probably 1.5 years to 2 years now about loss trend in personal auto and the -- particularly the bodily injury severity side. And that has been running at an elevated level, the aggregate 5% loss trend we've talked about for the last couple of quarters. So as we've earned in the rate increase, the margin expansion hasn't been quite as dramatic as it has in other businesses. So that would be the first point I'd make. The other, on the overall growth, the retention has remained pretty solid and has actually picked up a little bit the last quarter. And the real strategy here is the new product and having a more competitive product in the marketplace and, as Greg went through, the biggest lever in that is what we've done on the expense side. Historically, our loss ratio performance in this business is top quartile, the expense ratio, and that's all in with commission has been the challenge. And so we think the new product will deal with that pretty effectively.\nJoshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: So when I think about the new product and the legacy drivers on the older iterations. Where should we see expense ratio 1 year from today? Will it be higher or will it be lower than it is right now?\nBrian W. MacLean: Well, expense ratio, we're -- we fully expect will be lower. So the expense actions that we took, the $140 million that we're taking out of our operations, is not product specific. That's coming out of the business. About $100 million of that $140 million, I think, was Auto, and some of it is in the personal lines franchise, so it will affect the other products as well.\nJay S. Fishman: I guess I'd look at 2 other things. First, even 1 year from now, the percentage that Quantum 2.0 makes up of our total book is still going to be a relatively small percentage. And so relative to the commission component, there will still be a meaningful portion of Quantum 1.0 that will still be on the books. I don't know if the expense ratio will be lower. I don't know what's going to happen to premiums. I don't know how effective the product is in restoring new business. We know what we've done in terms of expenses. That we've done, and we can be very clear and very certain about that. What happens in the marketplace and what percentage Quantum 2.0 makes of the whole book, that's yet to be determined.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.\nMeyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: I'm going to ask this maybe in a more specific way that it can be answered, but if you had the Quantum 2.0 rate decreases in effect now, do you have any sense as to what the year-over-year PIF change would have been?\nJay S. Fishman: No. I can tell you what we did in looking at its pricing structure was to do a fair amount of back testing. And we went back with the product, and we went back with the pricing and we went back with the sales to determine at least to be able to have a perspective on competitive profile. Now we feel pretty good about that. The back testing results were encouraging. But that doesn't take into account competitive reaction or what other companies will do or not do. So we don't know. I can tell you that the back testing caused us to be encouraged, but we only control what we control. And so I -- we don't know what the PIF would be if we had rolled it out.\nMeyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Okay, I completely understand. In the 10-Q, you talk about favorable development, even on very recent years, for general liability because, in part, of the judicial environment. Can you talk a little bit about how you can tell, in the near term, whether that's actual benign emergence as opposed to just timing issue?\nJay S. Benet: Yes, this is Jay Benet. When you look at longer-tail lines, you're looking at what's taking place in the current environment. But when we think about the current environment, that's not a snapshot of the last 3 months. That's a snapshot of a longer period of time. So if you see some favorable development in a long-tail line that's taking place and -- relative to recent years, what we're really talking about is going back a few years, looking at the favorable judicial environment, in this particular case that you're asking about, and then saying, okay, now that we know that from the past, what does that mean rolling forward into the loss picks that we had for the more current period? So it's not a look at, okay, what was the expectation for loss in the 2012 accident year, what are the losses there. It's a more fulsome look over periods that preceded that as to what does that mean for our loss pick for 2012. I hope that answers your question.\nMeyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Yes, it does.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cliff Gallant of Nomura.\nClifford H. Gallant - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: I had another question on Quantum 2.0. You said that you were cutting your commissions, I believe, 2 points. I'm just curious, how does the agent take that? Are they excited about the reduced price? So they get volume? And also, I'm curious, when you think about your total relationship with your agents, how important is that 2-point cut on just that -- on just the Auto product?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, so obviously, it's a question we've thought about a lot. I'd start with, I think broadly, we. And by we, I mean the industry here. We don't give our agents enough credit and that, first and foremost, they fully appreciate the need to have a competitive product in the marketplace. And they are very aware of what's gone on in the private passenger consumer auto business, and they know they need more competitive alternatives. I'd also emphasize that we really built this product with lots of agent input. And hopefully, we've also been able to demonstrate to the agents that we are really committed to the independent agent channel. And this really gets to your last point of when agents look at us and what we do across the spectrum of our businesses. I think they appreciate that we are at the forefront of underwriters that are working aggressively to make that channel successful. So I think all of those things are very positive. With that said, every agent, all things being equal, would rather have higher commission than lower commission. But we feel really good about the dialogue we've had with them and the engagement, and we will see what the results are as they roll out.\nJay S. Fishman: And I'd make the observation that the comparative rating process, it's obvious to us, and we've shared that data with you, is trumping everything, that competitive price at the point of sale from a well-respected company and a quality brand name matters a lot more than whether commission is 1 point or 2 higher or 1 point or 2 lower. There are lower-paying commission companies that have grown value, grown volumes significantly, and there are higher paying that have not. It's not -- it's a factor, but at least, as we assess the marketplace, it certainly isn't the most meaningful factor.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Charles Sebaski of BMO.\nCharles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Following up on the Quantum 2.0 and the direct market channel. Given this level of an expense cut, is it too -- is this product going to be available in the direct-to-consumer? And do you expect that to grow that channel?\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, and we sure hope so.\nCharles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay.\nJay S. Fishman: It's certainly -- we -- one of the things that we -- and we've talked about this in the last couple of calls. We've been doing price testing in a couple of states, trying to determine elasticity of demand in a more granular way. And it became apparent to us that we needed a lower-priced product not only to be more successful in a comparative rating agent-driven world but also in the direct-to-consumer world. This will make a meaningful difference. I don't know what happens from the competitive reaction, but this will make a difference in the attractiveness of the product in the direct channel.\nCharles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay. The -- a question on pricing and the competitive marketplace on Management Liability. There seems to be increased focus from some of your competitors. I'm just wondering if you have any color on what you see going on there with pricing and just competition in general.\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Sure. It's Alan Schnitzer. There's always competition in these markets. And you really can't look at this as one broad Management Liability market. There are different geographies, there are different products, there are different lines, different segments, and each of them has their own dynamics. So as we've been approaching the market, we price as granularly here, as we do in the other lines that we talk a lot about, seeking to get rate on those lines and those accounts where we need it. And we've been successful doing that, and you see the RPC in the quarter having been the result of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So I wanted to continue with some comment -- questions around Quantum. And one of the -- I think in one of your presentations, you guys provided a scatter plot, a sort of new versus old price. I'm wondering if you could talk to us generically about the sort of the lift charts you've done where you compare loss ratios for -- against the price changes you're taking, much like the, I think, the slides you guys used a bunch of times now with your commercial lines of business as people how think -- people think about personal, a lot of changes. And I'm trying to just get a better sense of whether Quantum 2.0 is a big deal from the pricing segmentation perspective or whether it's really more about sort of the repackaging, the cost cutting and lower commissions into just a new business offering that you can use to drive volume.\nGregory C. Toczydlowski: This is Gregory Toczydlowski again. Anytime we bring a new product out, we constantly learn from the prior one. We take that experience, and we get a little more sophisticated and a little more segmented. So Quantum 2.0 will clearly have additional segmentation in addition to some product features that you talked about. But really, when we look at those scattergrams, that really is our understanding of what loss experience is in the marketplace of our quote business and our in-force business. And then we bring the new product out, where there will be, as Jay said, ups and downs across various customers, but it is because of that new segmentation.\nJay S. Fishman: And at the Barclays conference, we actually gave a couple of examples of specific underwriting changes that were incorporated into 2.0 as a result of what we had learned in 1.0, areas in which we had been too stringent, where we had set an underwriting standard that not only wasn't competitive but even when we sold the product turned out not to make a difference in the loss performance. So there's some of that as well in this. It's not just a lower price cranked into a new product.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: That's helpful. A broader question I'd love to ask is you guys very helpfully gave us guidance on pricing, if I can call it that, sort of your outlook in the Q, which I think I interpret -- can interpret as saying that you're going to continue -- you're going to do what you're going to do. And, I mean, the market will do what it does, but that you're going to continue to raise price for the next -- through the end of the year and well into '14. You guys actually have to plan the business many months ahead, rate revisions, product filings. You're probably doing an annual budgeting process right now. What guidance are you actually giving your staff? And what are you actually planning for in 2014?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, first, I'd disagree that we give guidance. We're giving you our outlook. We're required to give one. We do the best we can. We always say that we're going to attempt to do what we're going to attempt to do. We don't know what anyone else will do and, therefore, I don't know whether it'll succeed in the marketplace. We've said that over and over. And also, in the 10-Q, we really speak to renewal premium change in the aggregate, not just rate, but we talk about renewal premium change. What -- our instructions to the field organization in Business Insurance are no different today than they were 1 month ago or 2 months ago or 3 months ago. It's account by account; it's drive business from the right side of the segmentation to the left, meaning from the poor-performing categories to the best-performing categories; as we move left, focus more on retention and less on rate, although it's great if we can get rate in excess of loss trend even in our best-performing business; and at the right side if, and we've shown you this information before, if retention is comparatively low, that's just fine. You're talking about components of the business that are not building value but taking value. And our instructions to them are no different. We don't give them a target. Our experience has been, over a long period of time, that if you give a field force a target, you will get it, but you will not get it in a way that's designed to actually produce improved profitability. You'll get the rate that you asked for on the poorest accounts. You will lose the accounts that are best performing in the minimum rate thresholds. So we give them analytical data. We give them lots of information. And we are very return driven. They try and improve the returns on the accounts, and then we leave it to the underwriters to execute. And that is the way we run the business.\nGabriella Nawi: And this will be the last question, please. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Just a couple of quick ones here. First, you mentioned in the Q that the G&A expenses in the Business Insurance benefited from reduced assessments. I wonder if you can just quantify that for us?\nJay S. Benet: Hold on a minute.\nBrian W. MacLean: It's not a number we have off the top of our heads. You want to go to your next one while we look for that one?\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Sure. Yes. I guess the second one, I'm curious, when you closed the Dominion acquisition, do you plan on implementing the kind of Quantum 2.0-type pricing there as well? And in addition to that, what about -- with respect to kind of commission rates and stuff. Are you going to apply that to the Dominion personal auto book? Because I know they got a pretty big Ontario auto book. And how that's going to be impacted by the 15% rate reduction that Ontario is taking?\nAlan D. Schnitzer: It's Alan Schnitzer. We will certainly be applying all of our knowhow in technology and thought process from our U.S. experience into Canada. Whether that exact product, with those specific characteristics, translates or not will be a question for us, but we will certainly have all of our resources and knowhow martialed to bring to bear to that product.\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, the commission, the TL&F variance, that you're looking at is about 12 pretax. So it's relatively modest. But when you look at a quarter-over-quarter comparison, it does come into play.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us. And as always, Andrew Hersom and myself are available for any additional follow-up questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect all lines. Thank you, and have a good day."}, {"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 2, "year": 2013, "date": "2013-07-23 14:20:10", "content": "Executives: Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Member of Operating Committee Jay S.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, July 23, 2013. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Andre. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay S. Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our results this quarter, posting record net income per share of $2.41. We are particularly gratified that this is another quarter which demonstrates the very successful execution of the pricing strategy in commercial lines, which we embarked on nearly 3 years ago. Our granular active approach to improving profitability has been very successful. The aggregate rate and retention data that we showed -- that we show you for our commercial businesses demonstrate the success, but the data underneath tells an even more powerful story of improvement in profitability. This is important, and Brian will take you through that in more detail. But let me share with you that underlying margin improvement in our commercial businesses since 2011, which we achieved primarily through earned rate, our renewal business exceeding loss trend has, as of now, generated an increase in after-tax operating income of $650 million on an annualized basis. If we include Personal Insurance, and more to say on personal lines in a minute, the increase is more than $1 billion. Importantly, we have done so without disruption to our agents or customers. The relevant question now is where do we go from here? Since 2005, we have maintained a financial goal of producing a mid-teens operating return on equity over time. The over time aspect of the goal allows us to maintain the objective even when conditions are such that returns at that level are not immediately achievable on an accident year basis such as now. If you adjust our year-to-date operating return on equity of 15% to more of an accident year look by excluding the impact of net favorable prior year development, as well as the impacts of the favorable tax and legal resolutions, the adjusted ROE is approximately 8.5%. Also, to achieve a mid-teens operating ROE over time, there will be years where we must exceed the target because there will be other years when, due to any number of factors, we will fall below. So it is clear that we have more work to do to achieve our objective, and as a consequence, our strategy remains intact. We will continue to execute for improved returns, just as we have been doing. In Personal Insurance, we have also had a strategy of improving profitability through higher pricing. What has become apparent to us in the auto insurance line is that the combination of the rapid adoption of the comparative rater technology in independent agents offices, which now is the source of the substantial amount of the quotes that we issue and changing consumer expectations for this product have impacted our new business volume meaningfully. Consequently, we have concluded that to improve profitability and to create long-term value, we must have a more competitively priced product. By leveraging technology and taking other actions, we will make substantive changes to our business processes that we expect will allow us to meaningfully reduce costs without impacting service or quality. Brian will take you through the details, but through these actions we expect to be able to more competitively price our product and improve our profitability. Before I hand it over to Jay, I'd like to comment on our announcement in June that we agreed to acquire the Dominion of Canada. This was a strategic move, providing us with meaningful scale and market position in Canada. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity and are looking forward to welcoming the Dominion employees to Travelers. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks very much, Jay. Let me start by saying how pleased we all are with the second quarter and year-to-date results. And I do want to correct one thing Jay said, on Page 21 of the webcast, we do have a reconciliation of the operating return on equity year-to-date as reported of 15%. And when you do adjustment in net favorable prior year development and the favorable tax and legal settlements, it's actually 11.5%, would be -- what we consider to be the accident year kind of run rate of that. But with that, our liquidity and capital positions remain very strong, and we continue to generate capital in excess of what we need to support our businesses. Operating cash flows of approximately $722 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date were also very strong, notwithstanding the cat losses that remain very high relative to historical standards although it's significantly below the corresponding prior year periods. We maintained our strong cash position, ending the quarter with holding company liquidity of just over $2 billion, after returning $491 million of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $191 million and common share repurchases of $300 million. Our strategy of returning excess capital to our shareholders remains unchanged. As we've stated in the past, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed operating income over time. And in any given period, the difference between operating income and the level of dividends and share repurchases will also be a matter of timing. I'd remind you also the amount of common share repurchases will also depend on a variety of additional factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's ratings, our share price, pension funding needs, strategic initiatives and other market conditions. We've included an overview of our cat reinsurance coverage on Page 20 of the webcast, which has been structured in a way that is generally consistent with the prior year. Effective May 16, we entered into another 3-year reinsurance agreement with long-term -- Long Point Re III in which they issued $300 million of cat bonds, providing us with Northeast hurricane coverage on a specified -- on specified lines of business subject to a $1.25 billion retention, after which we can recover up to $300 million on a proportional basis until covered losses reach $1.8 billion. Effective July 1, we renewed our gen cat treaty with terms that look similar to last year, an attachment point of $1.5 billion and with covered losses of up to $400 million within the $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion level -- layer. Also effective July 1, we renewed our $600 million Northeast gen cat treaty with the same $2.25 billion attachment point as in the prior year. Given the current reinsurance pricing environment, all of this was accomplished at a cost that was lower than the prior year. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, which also includes a description of our gen cat aggregate excess of loss treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences, is included on our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today, as well as in our 10-K. All of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 20.1%. Due to the recent rise in interest rates, net unrealized investment gains decreased by $1.2 billion after-tax in the quarter, driving a 2% reduction in book value per share in the quarter or 1% year-to-date. This impact of higher interest rates more than offset the very positive impact on book value per share of our strong earnings, which was the major driver of the change in adjusted book value per share. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, increased 3% during the quarter and 5% year-to-date. I would note that the rise in interest rate does have a positive side. Going forward, if interest rates stay at their current levels, we'll be able to reinvest proceeds from maturing bonds at higher yields than we were previously assuming. I would point out though that at current interest rate levels, this will still result in a reduction in future net investment income, just not as much. The rise in interest rates also led to an $87 million after-tax realized investment gain this quarter due to our use of U.S. Treasury futures to shorten the duration of the investment portfolio. At the beginning of the year, given the interest rate environment and the economic outlook, we decided to increase our short position from its then nominal amount of $800 million. The position was increased to $2 billion by the end of the first quarter and further increased to as much as $2.7 billion before the position was closed by the end of the second quarter due to our outlook for interest rates versus the carrying cost of this strategy. Lastly, I'd also like to point out that the rise in interest rates has not been significant enough to impact our pricing strategy in any meaningful way. So Brian is now going to provide some further comments on operating results.\nJay S. Fishman: Jay, just let me interrupt one second, if I may. I understand I misspoke and I know you corrected it, but because it is so important, please just let me reiterate that the adjusted ROE on what I described as the more of an accident look is 11.5%. If I said 8.5%, it was indeed just simply an error on my part. It's 11.5%. Thank you. Brian, I apologize.\nBrian W. MacLean: No problem. Thanks, Jay. I'll go right to the segment results, beginning with Business Insurance, where we continue to be extremely pleased with the fundamentals of the business. The combined ratio for the quarter of 96.2% improved nearly 7 points versus the prior year, while the underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, improved over 3 points. Looking at production results for the segment on Page 9, retention and renewal premium change were both strong and in line with recent periods at 80% and nearly 9%, respectively, while new business volume was down slightly from the first quarter. Over the last 6 quarters, the production trends have been remarkably stable with retention running consistently around 80%, renewal price change between 8 and 10 points and rate around 7% to 8%. Slides 10 through 12 show a basically similar story of consistency for each of the businesses within the segment, and in each case, the compounding effect of rate increases is driving a meaningful improvement in our combined ratios. So the aggregate production results remain strong but as we've mentioned many times, the aggregate numbers alone don't tell the entire story. In fact, the detail of where we are getting the rate and what accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our pricing strategy. On Slide 13, we show our commercial accounts rate change and retention data for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the second quarter of 2012. The data is segmented by the individual account's long-term loss ratios, with the bars on the left representing our best-performing accounts and the bars on the right representing our worst performing accounts. We've shown this data before and I want to emphasize that it's a summarized version and the analytics we actually used to manage the business are at a much more granular level. The results show that for our better accounts, retention was very strong and rate change was solid and consistent with the year ago. For our core performing business, rate increases were up significantly year-over-year while retention was down meaningfully. Additionally, as you evaluate our results, keep in mind that our rate actions over the past 3 years have improved the returns in each of these loss ratio bands. So in fact, although the aggregate pricing improvements are very consistent over the past 6 quarters, an analysis of the underlying data reveals that our execution has, in fact, improved over time and is contributing to higher levels of profitability. So overall, in Business Insurance, very encouraging picture. The earned impact of these rate gains, along with loss trend across the segment that continues to run at about 4%, drove meaningful margin expansion. Going forward, our emphasis is continue to improve returns through maximizing the rate and retention trade-off at a very granular level. In Financial, Professional & International Insurance, operating income for the quarter was down 15% year-over-year due to higher catastrophe losses and less favorable prior year development. The cat losses in the quarter were primarily due to the unprecedented flooding in Alberta, Canada. Excluding cats and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio of 89.9% for the segment was strong and improved more than 2 points year-over-year. This improvement was driven largely by expanding margins in our Management Liability business, along with the impact of recent underwriting initiatives across the segment. Written premium was up slightly compared to the prior year quarter, driven by strong surety results, continued favorable rate in Management Liability and new business in international, partially offset by higher levels of written [ph] premiums. In June, we were pleased to announce our agreement to acquire the Dominion of Canada. The combined business will benefit from Travelers' sophistication in the use of data and analytics, as well as claim and risk control capabilities. The Dominion's extensive distribution network provides us with an exceptional platform for expanding our commercial lines business in Canada. In combining Travelers of Canada surety, Management Liability and commercial middle market products with the Dominion's commercial and personal portfolios, we'll create an organization with significant product breadth and a balanced mix of business. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2013, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. In Personal Insurance, operating income was up significantly versus the second quarter of 2012 due to lower levels of catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting margins. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter showed a 3-point improvement year-over-year with about 2 points driven by earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends. Looking specifically at Auto production trends, retention of 80% and renewal premium change of over 8% were both in line with recent periods. Net written premium and new business volumes were down year-over-year as a result of our pricing actions. Turning to Auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio of 96.4% was an improvement of over 1 point versus the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the earned impact of the rate -- written rate gains we have achieved over the past several quarters. Loss cost trends for Auto remain consistent with recent quarters, with mix adjusted frequency continuing to be benign and severity stable at a slightly elevated level. Specifically, bodily injury severity this quarter remained in line with what we've seen in the previous 3 quarters. In Homeowners, pricing was also very strong, with renewal premium change coming in at over 11%. Retention was consistent at 83%, while new business volume was down slightly from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio for Home was 81.5% in the quarter, an improvement of over 3 points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by a lower level of non-cat weather losses, along with earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends. So a very strong underwriting result, and we are beginning to see the positive impact of our underwriting and pricing actions. So overall, a very good quarter. But as Jay mentioned in his opening comments, the personal auto marketplace is changing. We remain committed to offering a product that is both competitively priced and delivers an appropriate return for our shareholders. And accordingly, we are taking expense reduction actions that will allow us to improve both pricing competitiveness and product returns. Specifically, we expect to reduce our claim and other insurance expenses, such that we realize a savings of $140 million pretax when fully implemented. This represents about a 10% reduction in our unallocated claim and other insurance expense base in Personal Insurance. We will begin realizing some of these savings immediately and they will be fully realized in 2015. The savings will be achieved through the consolidation of certain operations, along with other efficiency gains throughout the business. The majority of the savings will be driven by staff reductions, primarily through attrition, but we will also be giving notice to approximately 450 employees this week. We expect to take a restructuring charge of about $16 million, $10 million of which is expected to be incurred in the third quarter of 2013. While some of these savings will be realized in our Homeowners business, the majority of the impact will be in Auto, and these actions are clearly aimed at improving our strategic position in that line. We are pleased with the progress we've made in the personal lines business and we believe these actions will allow us to offer an even more competitive product in a challenging marketplace. I'll now turn it over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Brian. Before we open it for questions, I'd like to note that the management team is participating from several different locations this morning, so please bear with us as we coordinate our responses. With that, Andre, can we open it up for questions, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Two quick questions. First, it relates to pricing. In terms of the Business Insurance pricing trends, I'm looking at the renewal rate change. Do you think, based on where we are and what rates we have achieved in the past, does the RRC and Business Insurance, does it stay somewhat flattish from here? Or does it change meaningfully from here?\nBrian W. MacLean: So let me start. This is Brian MacLean. Let me start with an answer and then, Jay or Jay, chime in. I -- the first observation I'd make is when we look at the actual results, so we're not going to go far out in the crystal ball world, but if we look at the actual results over the last 6 quarters, from Page 10, it's incredibly stable. The red line there of renewal rate change is basically rounding off of 7.5% for all of those quarters. So what we saw in the quarter was very consistent with where we've been. Our view about it -- I would want to emphasize what we said in the presentation, that we don't have a target and it's not necessarily about attaining a specific level of rate gain, it's about achieving returns. So we're looking very granularly and obviously trying to retain the best business and drive the price increases on the weaker stuff. There can be a -- next quarter, a rate change number identical to the one that we just have, which might be generating much better returns or much worse, depending on where you get it. So we're very focused on the segmentation. As far out as we're going to go is what we saw in the quarter was very consistent. June was a pretty strong month. July looks like it's trending pretty consistently, but where the market's going to be in 3, 4, 5 months, we'll all see. But we haven't seen anything in our results that would say that the market is about to shift dramatically and the fundamental situation with interest rates and weather volatility continues.\nJay S. Fishman: Brian, would you agree that over the last 3 years as more of the Commercial Business has moved from the right side to the left side, and as a consequence, more as in the higher margin rather than the lower margin business? That achieving a flat rate in that same environment is actually net underneath an actual improvement.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. And what you mean by flat rate is 7.5% round number rate increase?\nJay S. Fishman: Correct. It's really the rate applied to the mix that is the important factor here.\nBrian W. MacLean: Right. When we look at our granular execution and the impact of now a couple of years of rate increases on the portfolio, we feel the round numbers, 80% retention, 7.5% rate we're getting today, is producing a much better result than the 80% and 7.5% renewal rate change we were getting 1.5 years ago. So we feel very good about it.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Got it. That's helpful. I'm sorry, go ahead.\nBrian W. MacLean: I was just going to say, but don't see any major shifts in what's going on in the market.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Yes. One quarter does not make a trend, but we'll see. The only other question I had is on...\nJay S. Fishman: I will just make an observation. It's not one quarter. It's been a lot of quarters. And just an observation as to the data. That's all.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Yes. The other question was on Dominion, Dominion's business mix and a combined ratio. And I know it's a bit too early. Just looking at their business mix and their combined ratios, could you just sort of broadly talk about what your strategy might be and how it might differ versus the current strategy?\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Sure. Amit, it's Alan Schnitzer. But when you're talking about the current strategy, I'm not sure exactly which one you're asking.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: I'm talking about the combined ratios, 106.1% for 2012, and their top line is $1.2 billion. Just sort of broader thoughts on that going forward. How does that change? Does it change near term? Or does it take somewhat longer to turn that around?\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Sure. Let me take a stab at that. So stepping back, the transaction really is a strategic transaction for us. It gives us important scale and competitive position in a big market that currently we're -- we don't have either in. So from a strategic perspective, we think it's important. In terms of what's driving that combined ratio, a lot of that is their personal lines Auto business. And we think that when we bring our data and analytics and claim expertise to that marketplace, we can -- and it'll take some time, but we think we can substantially improve that result. Also, they've got a small commercial platform that we like a lot. We think we can bring our expertise and analytics from that business into that marketplace. And one of the real benefits for us in this transaction is that they've got a terrific distribution platform in Canada, and we like the opportunity to expand our commercial middle market products through their distribution. So we think that there is good premium growth in the platform from that. So -- and looking overall in international, we've been, certainly over the last couple of years, focused on investing in that business and managing the loss side, which we've done very effectively over the last couple of years. So we're very confident that when we apply that same expertise to the Dominion, we'll be able to have positive effects on that. One of the impacts of what we've been doing for a couple of years is the expense ratio has ticked up, both from investing in people and data and analytics and also from, over the years, having shed some premium that didn't meet the risk and reward calculation for us. So the additional volume that comes on from Dominion really helps us from the expense side as well. So that's really sort of the outlook and the strategic positioning of the transaction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: In regards to margins, in the press release, I noticed that low levels of large losses were cited at -- within the international segment. And I also noticed that lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses were cited in personal lines. So I guess, does that mean we should build some margin cushion into our forward estimates given non-cat level large losses have been running below historical averages? Or am I thinking about that wrong -- the wrong way?\nJay S. Benet: Yes. This is Jay Benet. As we've said in previous quarters, any individual quarter is going to be impacted by things that go well beyond the general flow of earned rate versus what you'd consider to be the underlying loss trend. Now we spike out at least verbally because that's probably as good as it's going to get. We have things like large loss activity and some view as to, with the non-cat weather, favorable or unfavorable relative to the prior year and we try to give you that perspective. What we always suggest you do is look at the longer-term view as to what the combined ratio looks like x cat and few ID [ph], and with those words around and what others say, try to get a view as to what the weather looks like and build that into your models. I hope that's helpful because that's probably as granular as we can get with it.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay. Yes, it just stood out because I know in 2Q of last year, you also cited lower levels of large losses.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, because the other thing you could do is we wrestle with this as well. So we try to put some words into the outlook within the 10-Q that might also be helpful.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: Okay, great. Last question, in regards to investment income levels. I noticed the portfolio's average pretax yield actually rose a bit sequentially to 3.9%. And I think you cited duration increasing. Can you comment on how we should perspectively think about those dynamics, given the recent increases in new money rates?\nWilliam H. Heyman: Well, I think what -- it's Bill Heyman. I'd go first to what Jay said earlier and that is the recent increase in market rates obviously permits us to put new money out at better rate than we were before, but still at rates below the book yields on maturing securities. So I think I would simply take the projections which Jay has made in the past of net investment income going out 2, 3, 4 years and tweak them for this increase in rates, and frankly, I wouldn't tweak them much. If this is -- if what we have seen in June is all we're going to see in 2013 and some will think that may be the case, I wouldn't make major changes in projections.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, if I could add a couple of things. The -- we talked about the short position in treasury futures. And by eliminating that at the end of the quarter, that had an impact of slightly expanding the duration of the portfolio. Having said that, too the rise in interest rates also expands the duration of the portfolio, given the expected impact on bonds that would be called or not called under that circumstance. So the change in duration is really not a structural change at all in the portfolio. And as Bill just said, the rise in interest rates would have a fairly moderate impact on the reinvestment yields so -- given how much is rolling over versus what's enforced. And in our 10-Q, in the outlook section, we talk about all of this having an impact that would suggest about $25 million less in after-tax net investment income off of the fixed income portfolio per quarter going forward, if interest rates stay where they are, and I think before we said the out number was about $30 million. So it's a relatively modest impact.\nJay S. Fishman: And Jay, I would just make some one observation. You just -- you mentioned in passing that the gain was attributable to closing the position. That's actually not completely correct because it's a mark-to-market position, so whether we had closed it or not closed it, the gain would have been there. We closed it because of our expectations of interest rates and the relative cost of carrying the position. But the position is a daily mark-to-market position.\nJay S. Benet: That's entirely right. Thanks for correcting that, Jay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So obviously, we've all been very impressed for the past couple of years with your pricing leadership, pricing approaching, I guess, 20% at this point. You've helpfully done the math for us in 11% or 12% x your ROE. And there's obviously still some pricing yet to earn in and rates are moving higher and so I think we're all sort of sitting out here just scratching our heads, trying to figure out how much longer pricing will continue. You've given us some guidance, which is helpful in your Q. And I'm wondering if you can just expand the math a bit and give us a sense when you've actually worked with your actuaries and meet with your insurance regulators, and share them with your indications, how much more rate in some of your major segments do you actually need to take at these levels?\nJay S. Benet: Jay, you want to start or...\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, I was just taking about how to do that. First, I -- we've always said that one of the things we can't do is to, in any way, is to project or speculate competitive reactions. So just because we articulate pretty clearly what we intend to do, it certainly doesn't mean that it's going to happen or that we approach it with that certainty. But nonetheless, we continue to have a space to go. We've been saying for the longest time, and I take some pride in the fact that the objective, the financial objective, that we articulated now some 8 years ago is one that we stayed with consistently. It's not been remanufactured to be convenient to the environment. It is what we think long-term returns in our business should be and hopefully can be again. But our goal is to get back to the mid-teens return on equity over time, and at 11.5% now on an accident year basis, round numbers, we still have a ways to go. Not all products are the same, very important. Not all businesses are the same. And as a consequence, not all pricing strategies are the same. We talk all the time about the analytic grid that demonstrates high to low returns and our emphasis on pricing relative to that. But every time you take a step up, it changes, whether you're talking about an individual product line like Workers' Comp or property or whether you're talking about a particular business like construction versus our surety business. So the strategies are all quite different and they are all return-driven. But in the aggregate, we are going to continue to push as long as we can, until such time as we bring ourselves back to the long-term objective. And I think that's probably about as clear as we can be. I -- we've resisted, even internally setting artificial goals or targets or budgets, and rather always look at what we've always articulated as our long-term goals to be.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. So 2 things that I would add because, Josh, in your question, you put in there rates moving. I would just point out that the rate movement that we just saw in interest rate has really had virtually no impact on our pricing, and to some degree, because it was a relatively small move in rates. But even the 100 basis points, at one point in time, at the 10 year got a lot of play. The duration of our liability is significantly shorter than that. So you have to look at the whole yield curve and see where rates are moving. So that has had minimal impact. And we'd need quite a bit of movement in interest rates before started changing pricing significantly. And the other...\nJay S. Fishman: We -- actually, Brian, just in that regard, we asked, and I do think these 2 comments are important, most of our, call it, free cash, I don't mean to define that term, but most of our free cash is used in buying back share. So if you look at our portfolio position over the last several years, it's actually been relatively flat. And most of our investing is reinvesting. And so we're not -- it's not as if we're deploying significant amounts of new cash, we've been deploying it in buying back shares. We did ask our actuaries to make an estimate of what a 100 basis point increase would be in the entire curve if there was a shift because, of course, every product is invested -- the underlying products have a duration philosophy is tied to the -- that's tied to the asset. They're not directly matched but it's very much a philosophical match. And this is just an estimate and I perhaps even would call it a guesstimate. But in terms of returns, the equivalent of 100 basis point move in the yield curve would be about 2 to 3 points in pricing rate. So 2 to 3 points in price would be equivalent in returns to 100 basis point move in the entire yield curve. Brian, am I recalling that correctly?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, that's correct.\nJay S. Fishman: Yes.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. The other quick thing I'd point out is that weather volatility is still there. And although our second quarter cat number was dramatically less than what we have seen the last 2 years, it is dramatically higher than what 3 years ago we would have said was historical second quarter norms. So that is still out there and the marketplace needs to deal with it. So that's kind of our view.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: That's very helpful, Jay, Brian. Just one other question on strategy and distribution evolution. So your comments about the evolution of comparative raters, agents starting to use them for renewal business as well start to get sort of -- raise a whole bunch of questions and it's not obviously as good for the agents or -- and certainly more challenging for the company. I'm wondering if you can talk about how you think that your sort of broader sort of agency strategy evolves more if there's going to be changes in commissions or if you fundamentally try to change your position or approach to that market? And then just more broadly related to that same point, is this something that sort of starts in Auto and then moves to Home and moves the Select and ultimately as sort of a Pandora's box once it's opened?\nBrian W. MacLean: So let me -- this is Brian. Let me start with a couple of comments, and then Jay. And I'll go to your last comment first, Josh, which is, clearly, we look at this and say it doesn't have to be just a personal auto dynamic, but complexity of product is really significant in being able to build an efficient rater technology and business process. So even Homeowners is fairly more complicated than Auto and you get into the commercial products and much more complicated than Auto. So we watch it closely but we don't think we're on the verge of comparative raters everywhere. And then I'd say the big backdrop to the question is we're not looking at a fundamental shift across the board of how we deal with independent agents. One of the great strengths of our franchise is the position that we have with agents, and we have a lot of products and we have a lot of breadth and we're going to continue to leverage that, working with them closely on what their business process is and how we continue to together bring a value proposition to the customers is important. With that said, everything is on the table where we're constantly looking it all, the dimensions of it, but we feel good about where we are with agents. Jay?\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, I know, I'd -- just an observation. I think we have a well-deserved and well-earned reputation for being a low-cost-oriented company. We know from experience, I think, how to do that thoughtfully and in the best interest of the business. I think Brian's comment is right. We're determined to be successful in the business. We have an $8 billion premium combined personal lines business, and in fact, everything is on the table. But we do know how to do this. And the comparative rating technology, I get asked all the time, is the product becoming a commodity? And I'm always quick to answer, no. A commodity is a product where the only thing that doesn't matter is the price because all the prices are the same. Every -- oil, the price is the same. And that's not the case here. There are value differentiations and value perceptions and strength to agents and strength to customers, and there are differentiations. What the rater is doing, though, clearly, is increasing price competitiveness at the point-of-sale. The technology has introduced the ability of agents to see greater multiples of prices much more easily. And we do think that the onslaught of advertising over the last, and this is just an opinion, I can't prove it as a fact, but the onslaught of advertising in the space over the last 10 years has brought customers to the view that value is a more important component value dollars of the purchase than perhaps it was previously. So it's going to force a greater level of price competition and I think we're up to the task. And that's what we're going to do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: So one question I had for, I guess, maybe for Brian first is, just looking -- I know we look at this on a year-over-year basis but sequentially, the combined -- the underlying combined in business was up a bit. And then -- and even going back and looking at 1Q to 2Q, it's not clear that the second quarter is always higher than the first. And even if we'd look at year-over-year, I mean, you're 400 basis points better in the first quarter, 300 basis points-ish better here in the second. Just trying to understand that -- was non-cat weather an element of that comparison? Or any color there on kind of the margin in Business Insurance?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, Mike. I think there's always -- as Jay Benet was saying before, there's always volatility in the individual quarters. Nothing fundamental with the trend has changed over where we were with first quarter. And I know deltas have shifted a little bit. If you look at our data on Page 9, 3.1 points of underlying combined ratio better than last year and the first quarter was better than that. That was the movement in those other things. So we're going to have large losses go up or down or non-cat weather go up or down relative to the previous quarter. I think that we're still in the same place we were in the first quarter, where we think the core underlying margins here in BI are improving somewhere between 2.5 and 3 points for the business. And that is unchanged from where we were in first quarter. And everything has been, as I said before, pretty stable, both rate and loss trend there. So we don't see any fundamental shift. I know the numbers do move around a little bit.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Yes. And I'm just trying to understand given -- so that's great. So the 2.5 to 3 points remain so you had some noise maybe in second quarter. But is it possible to just give some parentheses around the rate-driven margin expansion that you saw in the first quarter versus the second quarter? Just because -- again, I mean, this is the first -- I mean, we've had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 consecutive quarters of sequential improvement in that underlying combined...\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, that's -- I think what I was trying to say, Mike, is the rate-driven margin improvement is the 2.5 to 3. When we try to back out the quarterly periodic volatility and what's the impact of the rate we're earning in versus the core loss trend, that continues to run at 2.5, 3 combined ratio points. And again, you have to do the arithmetic to get the -- just bring it through the combined ratio to get the math to work.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Got it. Okay, great. And then, I guess, one question on the actions in personal lines. Any thought around in this process, the direct business, and kind of cost rationalization or continued investment on that front?\nJay S. Fishman: The decision is certainly not being driven by the direct business, but the direct business will most certainly benefit from a lower priced product. So it will certainly help in that regard. I do want to reemphasize, so that everyone understands clearly, that the intention here is to lower cost and increase profitability. So the reduction in cost will, in effect, not be passed on entirely to the price of the product. Some of it will be retained in the form of improved profit. At least that's the plan. So it'll help. It'll certainly help the direct business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Just wanted to follow up on the personal lines segment. The policy counts are -- and I mean, you've admitted the policy count declines are pretty stunning and accelerating, it seems, at least this year. Homeowners back to 2006 levels, personal auto back to '04 levels, the direct initiative seems to have stalled. So you guys are losing a lot of share. You've admitted that. What I'm wondering is, is the cost plan enough? In other words, is there -- there's clearly a pricing problem in the marketplace with this segment. So is the cost plan enough such as you can cut your pricing or get more competitive to begin to stem the share losses? And then second is, what's the timing around when we'll see the tangible actions in the P&L from a PIF perspective? I'm sort of wrestling with how long to take the share losses down in my model?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. Let me start, Jay, and then throw it to you and so I'd -- several comments there. And maybe one of the things I'd say right at the front is that the actions we're taking today are somewhat -- the expense actions are somewhat a reaction to what's going on in our top line but more focused on reacting longer term to some changing dynamics in the marketplace. So it's not just a -- because the PIF is down 12%. I would look at -- so a couple of things, number one is...\nJay S. Fishman: Brian, can I also ask you to speak because Greg asked the question with Home, Auto, direct, and I think there is a distinction to be made there as well.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, so let me start with Auto where we -- on the retail auto business through our agent channel. For starters, retentions remain pretty solid and that's been a positive. So although it's down a couple of points, it's still running at a solid level and the shortfall has been in new business. And as we've said and maybe has been obvious, that's clearly been impacted by our pricing action. We feel good that returns have improved, that the -- and 6 months are consistent with our expectations. And our price changes, independent of the expense actions, would -- will be mitigating, as you've seen in the last couple of quarters with the Auto business. So hopefully, that will bring the us back in line. The industry did post the 104.5% combined ratio last year. So it is a product that is needed rate and we feel good about the actions we take. We've taken, we think, the expense actions. And as we said before, anything else that we need to do in this business, everything is on the table, is really -- are really focused on improving that and helping us deal with the changing marketplace. So the Homeowners business, we view as fundamentally different there. We think there are some real capacity issues. That was, I think, much more of a focused weather exposure kind of actions. And so it's not just the pricing we've been driving there, which has fundamentally been driven by the losses, the weather losses, that has been come through. But it's also other actions we've taken from underwriting, deductibles, terms and conditions that have really, really driven us. So we feel very good about where our Homeowners business is right now and feel like we're in a position to move forward. The tricky part of your question is, where do we think the impacts -- well, what's the time horizon? We don't really forecast that out. We're looking at, clearly, a different PIF situation for 2014. But we'll see what that is, okay?\nJay S. Fishman: And just a closing comment on the direct because, Brian, I think you got both of those just right. The dynamic in direct is very much what we've been intending to do. We've been doing a test, a test of pricing sensitivity. And so our -- and people have asked you, your advertising is down. Yes, our advertising is down very intentionally because we've been focused on testing price elasticity in a very limited number of markets and gaining some insight into what that means. So I would just observe that there isn't anything in our direct channel other than also seeing and observing, of course, that pricing really matters, great shock, pricing really matters. And so again, what we're going to do in the personal space here will most -- we hope, we believe, will certainly help the direct channel as well.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. And I guess, just to follow up on this because the answer is very thorough, but what I'm wrestling with is I love that you're getting good price in the business and the retentions are holding in. So clearly, the core client base is sticking with the Travelers once in the umbrella. Direct is so small. It just seems like -- it's like an experiment, in a way, in the P&L. But really, in the agency side of Homeowners and Auto, it's the lack of the ability to attract new clients in. And I'm wondering if it's more than just the expense side. I'm wondering if it's actually you need to start to ramp advertising a lot more. You need to re-architect the product which you mentioned. I don't know if that costs money. I don't know if that's technology. In other words, I'm just -- I'm trying to wrestle with the cost to fix the new business acquisition engine in the Auto segment and...\nJay S. Fishman: The analytics that we have indicate, maybe even more than indicate, that pricing sensitivity for new business through comparative raters is just significantly different than it was in the past. And we have all sorts of data that shows when you're lowest in the comparative raters space, when you're second lowest and when you're third lowest. And so we know what it takes to be successful. And so I -- we don't believe that there's anything, with respect to our product, that needs to be reengineered or -- I mean, we're always filing changes. We're always filing changes in pricing. We're always filing changes in underwriting and claimants. So there's always changes going on. But we believe this is the issue in the new business front. And you're right, the renewal business has been quite stable, and that is very encouraging. So we think we're on the right path here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: I have 2 questions here for you. First, Jay, I'm just curious, the acquisition of Dominion, nice, opportunistic acquisition. But given where your stock price now is trading on a price-to-book multiple, does it change at all your thought process with respect to capital allocation? Are acquisitions here potentially more attractive than share buyback?\nJay S. Fishman: No, I don't believe so. This was -- there were a couple of things about the Dominion transaction that were really appealing to us. One, is it gave us some real size and scale in a market where we just were lacking badly; two, there were some scarcity value up there. There are precious few companies to be acquired. They're either mutuals or subsidiaries of larger companies or very large companies themselves. So there is a scarcity value. And it provided a first-rate management team, we think, and a terrific systems and technology and a platform to do business. So it had several compelling reasons that really just had us think about it as a special opportunity but not thinking about it differently in the context of capital management, no.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Great. And then the second question, I wonder if you could chat a little bit about the small commercial business. It seems to continue to be a little sluggish there. Is that because of the economic environment? Is it because that there's maybe more competitive down there? Why is it tending to be a little bit slower from a growth standpoint, actually declining this quarter on a written premium basis than some of the other lines?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, Brian, this is Brian MacLean. I'll start. There's several things that going on there. We've talked a while back about what was going on in the larger end, plus we talked a little bit about Auto trends that we were seeing in commercial and specifically in the Select world. So there were some targeted underwriting actions that we were taking, which we have now pretty much worked through. And it was a business, if you think of -- it's almost a great example of the segmentation concept that I was talking about in commercial accounts. If you looked across our spectrum of businesses in Business Insurance a couple of years ago, Select would've been one that, from a return perspective, we were struggling with more than others. So it would've been on the writer side of the graph of our businesses. And if you look at the pricing that we've gotten there, and in that business, RPC is really driving to the bottom line, we've gone to the point where we feel pretty good. We've worked through some underwriting actions, and that's one that we would be hopeful expecting that as the return picture has improved, we're going to be retaining more of that business going forward. So it is -- it's -- we feel good about how we've executed but we think the trajectory there should be changing in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: I guess, a couple of things. First, I guess 2 questions on pricing. The first is, the good news on pricing was, on the international side, it looks like there was an inflection point to the positive side. Can you talk about what's happening there?\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Yes, Jay, it's Alan Schnitzer. Certainly, it did pick up a little bit. I wouldn't call it an inflection point. And I'd say that the pricing dynamics outside of the United States continue to be very different than what we see in the United States. I think what you're seeing in our results, in particular, come from our efforts recently to increase our use of data and analytics and manage the portfolio and profitability. I wouldn't say there's an overall shift in the market though.\nJay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Got it. And I guess getting back to Business Insurance. You described the pricing environment over the past several years as quite stable, and clearly, that shows up in the graph. This deceleration that you've seen, modest as it is in the second quarter, investors are very sensitive to this. And I'm wondering -- I think, Brian, you had mentioned July being reasonably good. If you could give us some indication of where July stood relative to June or relative to the 2Q that would be helpful because, again, people are very sensitive to this issue. You stock is up 2.3%. Any color would definitely be helpful.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, and I think -- so I completely get it. I'll, on one hand, admit that we obsess over fractional movements in these things, but I think we and the marketplace are obsessing a little too much. And I know, we've got a better window into the detail than you do. So if you look at -- we ticked down a little bit from last quarter, literarily rounding off of 7.5%, which had ticked up a little bit from the fourth quarter. So the numbers have really been about, in the aggregate, 7.5%. Within Business Insurance, June was the strongest of the 3 months in the quarters. But again, I'm talking about fractions of a point here, of the difference between 7.2% and 7.4% in total rate. And July looks like -- right now, our look of July looks like it might be a little bit better than June. But again, I'm talking about rounding a couple of cents of a point. So I don't mean to overemphasize it. We get the sensitivity. I think we're all watching the market closely. But it's been about where it's been for a while. And then the last point I'd make is we're really actively managing the business. We're trying to make sure we're getting it in the right places and...\nJay S. Fishman: Yes. Brian, I was actually just going to interrupt because I do think that's so important. These conversations, there's almost a backdrop as if somehow pricing is magically obtained from a third-party source from somewhere. What we're getting is what we're trying to get. I ask the question all the time, are we trying to get 12% and we're getting 7%? And the answer is no. We're managing this process very thoughtfully, always with a focus to not having disruption to agents or customers. We're in the business for the long term. We look at returns over time and will continue to march in improving returns. And as long as we're moving that way, we feel pretty good. And by the way, the retention remains as solid as it has and you can see from the more detailed graph how strong that really is.\nJay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: So I guess, really, the main point based on this conversation is that the monthly data trend does not suggest any sort of slip-off, any notable slip-off? And what you're saying is the market to you does not feel like it is softening at this point despite this modest deceleration in the 2Q?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, first, it's only July 23, I think, so it's a little -- always a little reluctant to declare anything. We're only 3 quarters of the way through the month. So what we're getting is, to some extent, anecdotal with some data around it. So it's early. It's early. But if you -- on a more anecdotal basis, if you speak to people in the field, you don't get the comment back that there's any substantive change or receptiveness to our strategy. Brian, would you agree with that?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes -- no, I completely agree. And Jay, basically, I think the way you asked the question, yes, we'd agree with that, that what we've seen in our results and what we see and what were out in the marketplace quoting on, the market looks the same to us as it's been for a number of quarters now. We hear the same rhetoric but what we see and what we hear from our people is that it's continuing to move at about the same pace.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Clifford Gallant with Nomura.\nClifford H. Gallant - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: There's been talk in the reinsurance marketplace that some of the new capacity that's come in has perhaps structurally changed the business, maybe made reinsurance permanently cheaper or at least more stable. I'm curious, how do you -- how will that affect your business over time and how you manage things?\nJay S. Benet: Yes, this is Jay Benet. Well, first of all, as we've said in the past, we operate the business as a gross under -- gross lines underwriter. We don't rely on reinsurance to be in a particular marketplace. And when we do have reinsurance, it's generally in the larger risk or certainly in the cat area. As it relates to our view of the market, and I'm sure there are others who have a more intense view with their utilizing the market a lot more than we are, but given our view of the market, it would seem like there's a lot of capacity that's come in on the upper level cat kind of coverages. And that's helped drive prices down. And as I mentioned, the cost that we had this July of renewing our coverages were favorable, so it costs us less. How that's going to translate or if it will translate into the working layer-type benefits to companies that rely on that, we don't have any great insight, but it would seem, to us at least, unlikely that that's going to be where this capacity would want to play. So it's not a big impact on our business for sure and we'll see what happens going forward in the marketplace. But it seems like most of this capacity would be for higher-level cat coverage where the expectation of loss -- of actual losses taking place would be very, very low.\nOperator: This does conclude our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Nawi.\nGabriella Nawi: Very good.

Welcome to the First Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, April 23, 2013. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Andre. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay S. Fishman: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before turning to our results this morning, I want to take a moment and comment on the events of the last week. No doubt, someone will ask about the cost of the events in Boston or in West Texas. While right now we don't expect either event will be meaningfully costly to us, my real answer is that the human cost is stunning, and we are reminded of the fragile nature of the world in which we live. Our sympathies go out to everyone affected in these horrific events, and we will do all we can to help them in the recoveries. As we are reminded of September 11, we wish only the best for the folks in Texas and embrace fully the sentiment of Boston strong. Now turning to our results. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2013, with operating income of $2.31 per diluted share, which is the highest quarterly operating income per share since Travelers' initial public offering in 2002. Both net and operating income increased 11% from last year's first quarter results to $896 million and $887 million, respectively, producing a return on equity of 14.1% and an operating return on equity of 15.8%. Our margins improved significantly, with a GAAP combined ratio of 88.5%. Importantly, underlying underwriting margins increased across all our business segments, in large measure the result of the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken over the last few years. Our 90.8% underlying GAAP combined ratio was an improvement of almost 4 points from the prior year, as earned rate increases outpaced expected loss trends in each segment. While we are certainly pleased with these results, we will continue our strategy of taking the steps necessary to continue improving accident year profitability and returns. Our focus is evident in the production statistics for each segment this quarter. Renewal rates were at or above levels achieved in recent quarters and exceeded expected loss-cost trends in each segment. In addition, retention rates remain at very high levels. We also saw modest new business growth in Business Insurance. And while new business in Personal Insurance remains meaningfully down from historical levels, it was consistent with fourth quarter 2012 levels. Brian will take you through the details by segment. Next, I'd like to comment briefly about our total return to shareholders as measured by the net stock price change plus cumulative amount of dividends over the same time period assuming dividend reinvestment. We've shown this information in the past and believe it is an important measure of our long-term success. The universe you see on Slides 4 and 5 contain the 20 largest S&P financial companies by market capitalization, as well as companies in our P&C insurance peer group. As Slide 4 demonstrates, our total return to shareholders for each of these periods is impressive. Slide 5 shows the return on a Treynor risk-adjusted basis. And amongst these companies, we are first on a 1- and 5-year basis, and sixth on a 3-year basis. These results are very gratifying. It's worth noting that over the last 5 years, the compound annual growth rate in our book value per share has been 9.4%; in earnings per share, it's been 8.6%; and in dividends per share, it's been 9.7%. If we include the dividend increase announced today, it's 11.5%. Before I turn it over to Jay, I want to take a moment and extend the best wishes of 30,000 Travelers' employees to our friend and colleague, Chuck Clarke. Chuck is retiring after 55 years, indeed a lifetime of service with Travelers. It is not possible to overstate the impact that Chuck has had on so many of us at Travelers, and we will all benefit from his powerful legacy for many years to come. He is the best in our business, and we all wish him the best in this next chapter in his life. I will miss him more than I can express. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay S. Benet: Thanks, Jay. As Jay said, we're very pleased with our first quarter results as well as our liquidity and capital positions. Operating cash flows of approximately $530 million. It was strong despite higher-than-normal claim payment related to Storm Sandy. We repaid $500 million of debt that matured in March and maintained our strong cash position, ending the quarter with holding company liquidity of just over $1.5 billion. We continue to generate more capital than what is needed to support our businesses, so we returned $476 million of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $176 million and common share repurchases of $300 million, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. And we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.46 per share to $0.50 per share, an increase of almost 9%. We also recorded on a consolidated basis, pretax net favorable prior year reserve development of $231 million for the quarter, which was lower than the $304 million we recorded in the prior year quarter. And each of our segments, once again, saw its reserves develop favorably. I should point out that this quarter's reserve development included an unusual item, a $42 million pretax charge, precipitated by legislation in New York related to the New York fund for reopened cases for Workers' Compensation. Business Insurance accounted for a little less than half of this quarter's total reserve development. Favorable development in BI was driven by better-than-expected loss experienced in general liability for accident years 2003 and prior, as well as accident years 2004 through 2010, resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected; and by property loss development for accident years 2010 through 2012. I should also note that BI reserve development was reduced by the $42 million pretax charge precipitated by the New York legislation concerning Workers' Comp that I mentioned previously. And excluding the impact of this legislation, our Workers' Comp reserves were essentially unchanged for all accident years. The rest of this quarter's favorable reserve development primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss development in Bond & Financial Products contract surety business for accident years 2006, '07, '08 and '10, better-than-expected loss development of several international businesses within FPII and better-than-expected cat and non-cat loss development in Personal Insurance Homeowners business for accident year 2011. On a combined statutory basis for all of our U.S. subs, accident years 2003 and prior as well as accident years 2004 through 2011, all developed favorably in the quarter, while accident year 2012 developed very slightly unfavorably. And finally, to update you on Storm Sandy, our current estimate of total ultimate losses is now $1.011 billion net of reinsurance and pretax, down $13 million from our fourth quarter 2012 estimate. Finally, all of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels at the end of the quarter. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $4.4 billion pretax or $2.9 billion after-tax, a slight decrease from the beginning of the year, due to the rise in interest rates that took place during the quarter. And book value per share was $68 or $0.07 -- 7% higher than at the end of the prior year quarter and 1% higher than at the beginning of the year. So with that, let's have Brian talk about the operations.\nBrian W. MacLean: Thanks, Jay. I'll go through the segment results in some details, but the overall headline from an underwriting perspective is the margin expansion that we saw in all our business segments. Beginning with Business Insurance. We continue to be extremely pleased with the fundamentals of the business. The combined ratio for the quarter of 89.4% improved slightly versus the prior year. While the underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, improved by more than 4 points. As always, there's some non-run rate items in the quarter, but 3 points of the improvement was driven by earned rate increases that exceeded loss-cost trends. Net written premiums increased 5%, with the largest increase in Workers' Compensation, driven by higher rate and exposure in our guaranteed cost and National Account businesses. Turning to the production statistics, starting on Page 11. Overall retention was in line with recent periods at 80%. Pricing remains strong, with renewal premium change over 10%, and new business volume was up slightly from recent quarters. Drilling into the pricing results. The renewal premium change was driven by pure rate increases of 8% and exposure of over 2%. The rate gains we achieved this quarter were up slightly from both the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2012. Rate increases ranged from 6% to 10% across all lines and were once again led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto. As we've explained before, when comparing the quarter's data with prior periods, keep in mind that the data develops over time and can bounce around a bit, and this is especially true of exposure. On Slide 15, we show our commercial accounts rate change and retention data for the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2012. This slide presents a summarized view of how we analyze the pricing and retention on our renewal book to ensure we are taking the right actions. The data is segmented by the individual account's long-term loss ratio, with the bars on the left representing our best-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratio of less than 60%; and the bars on the right representing our worst performing businesses, that is accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%. The results show that retention is stronger for the better business and the rate change is dramatically higher on the poor performing accounts. I would emphasize that this is summarized data, so don't overanalyze the precision on the page. But what this data continues to tell us is that our underwriters are making the right targeted rate decisions, class by class, account by account. So with the continued improvement in pricing and loss trends holding across Business Insurance at about 4%, we continue to see meaningful margin expansion. In our Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, the combined ratio for the quarter was 82.3%, an improvement of 5.5 points year-over-year. The underlying combined ratio improved nearly 4 points, driven by underwriting actions across the segment, along with increased rate in our Management Liability business. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of improving underlying loss ratios for the segment. Net written premiums increased by 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower reinsurance cost across the segment. Gross written premium showed a modest increase of about 1% in the first quarter, driven by strong rate gains in our Management Liability book of business, partially offset by a slight decline in surety premium. All in, a great quarter for the segment. In Personal Insurance, operating income was up significantly versus the first quarter of 2012, due to higher underlying underwriting margins, lower levels of catastrophe losses and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. The combined ratio for the quarter of 89.4% improved more than 8 points versus the first quarter of 2012, while the underlying combined ratio showed more than a 3-point improvement year-over-year. Looking specifically at Auto, we continue to be very pleased with both pricing and retention, with renewal premium change of nearly 9% and retention at 81%, both in line with recent periods, while new business volume was down year-over-year. What these results demonstrate is that we've been successful in achieving rate increases on the renewal book, but our pricing actions have meaningfully impacted our new business, and we are watching this trend carefully. Turning to Auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio of 94.4% was an improvement of over 1 point versus the prior year quarter, reflecting the earned impact of the written rate gains we have achieved over the past several quarters. It's important to remember that there's a significant amount of seasonality and losses for this line, and the first quarter loss ratio typically runs a little below the full year average. I would also note that the unfavorable prior year development in this line is due to a slight increase in our estimate of Sandy Auto claims. Regarding loss-cost trends, we've been talking to you about increasing bodily injury severity for more than a year, and we were encouraged that the bodily injury severity trend we saw this quarter remained consistent with what we have seen in the previous 2 quarters. In addition, earned pricing remains in excess of our current view of loss trend. And assuming loss trend remains at this level, we will see year-over-year Auto margins expand for the remainder of 2013. Looking at Homeowners. Pricing was also very strong, with renewal premium change coming in at 12%, down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2012 but up more than 2 points year-over-year. Retention remains strong at 84%, while new business volume was meaningfully lower than the prior year quarter due to the execution of our pricing, underwriting and deductible strategies. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter of 81.1% improved more than 4 points over the prior year quarter, benefiting from a lower level of non-cat weather and fire losses, along with earned rate increases that exceeded loss-cost trend. So a very strong underwriting result. But given the ongoing volatility of weather patterns, we will continue to implement improved underwriting pricing in terms and conditions. Overall in the segment, there was progress on the underlying fundamentals along with some benefit from the lower weather-related losses but still a work in process, and we'll continue to execute on our strategy in order to further improve our results. With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Andre, we're ready for the question-and-answer segment. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Just -- I have one question, Brian. In -- you talked about Personal lines, you talked about the rate gains you're getting both on the Homeowners and the Auto side. But I think in the Q, the outlook you mentioned that you expected profitability to be roughly in line with what you saw in 2012. Just trying to square those 2 items, and just one follow-up.\nBrian W. MacLean: So -- and specifically, I just want to make sure, that's a Homeowners...\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: I think you said in the Q, I think it's said the outlook for Personal lines, overall, was that profitability would be -- should be in line with 2012 or you would expect it to be in line with 2012. And just given that you're taking mid- to high-single digit, I think you said double-digit rate gains, I'm just trying to understand how -- why that number shouldn't be better next year than this year.\nJay S. Benet: Yes. This is Jay Benet. What we tried to say in the Q was that what we had last year were various quarters that had favorable weather, favorable fire losses. And as you can easily understand in the Homeowners, it's very difficult to predict what a normal level of these things are. So thinking about what the outlook for the year was in Homeowners, our view was well, they were favorable last year, so whatever normal is this year, sounds like it should be a little higher. So despite having this underlying concept of rate exceeding some view of loss trend, and that's a pretty difficult concept when you get into a business that has so much of its losses tied up in weather and fire-type events, we do feel that there's an improvement in profitability coming about through pricing versus this concept of loss trend, but that improvement will be offset if these other levels of losses go back to whatever a\"normal\" is. So it's a very difficult equation, if you will, to try to come up with an outlook for that business but that was our best shot as it relates to Homeowners. And then on the Auto side, the view was a little marginal improvement based upon pricing, where it is today versus in that business a much better view as to what loss trend looks like. So...\nJay S. Fishman: A better meaning, more accurate, more predictable. Yes.\nJay S. Benet: Yes, yes. So looking at the 2 combined, one getting better, one if things go back to normal in Homeowners, who knows whether they will, getting a little less margin, the 2 of them should kind of offset and the profitability should be roughly at the same level.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: Understood. Okay, great. And then just in Business Insurance, we certainly saw exposures kind of pick up in some of the reporting that you provided us with. Just trying to understand, so you've got -- so you've -- you're taking rate, you're expecting to continue to do that, your retention is not falling and you're seeing exposures lift. Is that exposures on the business that you had? Or is that potentially being impacted by new business or new endorsements on old business?\nBrian W. MacLean: Michael, this is Brian. So the exposure numbers we show are all on our renewal book, for starters, driven by a whole bunch of things. In Property, for example, there's been a lot of movement to improve insurance to value. So that would -- we could have the exact same building but getting a different insurance to value on it, and that would be driving exposure up. It can be more employees in Workers' Comp. It could be more vehicles, more receipts on a GL rating, so it can be a whole -- all of those different things. As I mentioned in my comments, too, I would also point out that the granular nature of the exposure data, in particular on Commercial Accounts, moves around a bit, as premium audits come in, et cetera. So there is a lift there but maybe not as dramatically as some of that data shows. It moves around.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: And the premium auto, it's been trending in which direction recently?\nBrian W. MacLean: For the last several quarters, they've been pretty flat. They rose dramatically as we came out of the 2008-2009 time period. But for the -- yes, and clearly, it's positive. Premium audits have returned to the traditional couple points of positive on average.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: So this is obviously a great quarter. And as we sort of -- as we work through results, we're starting to get -- see some players get more comfortable with margins. And obviously, Travelers has been the leaders thus far in raising pricing and talking about sort of accident years being not a target. I'm curious to get a sense of how far you think we may have to go on pricing. You're guiding to continued pricing in '13 in your outlook in the K -- in the Q and would love to get a sense of how much further accident year sort of margin expansion you think that the industry needs to get back to target.\nJay S. Fishman: Josh, it's Jay Fishman. I can't speak to the industry or any other company. I can tell you what we're doing. We're going to continue, and it's driven by 2 factors: First, the weather remains unpredictable and just more uncertain than it has in many years, and that's been the case for the last several years and that's been driving much of our action. But the other part is that as our investment portfolio continues to mature, the effect of reduced interest rates will continue to push the fixed portion of net investment income down over the next several years. We've provided those projections to you previously with -- or actually they're more than projections, they're almost the actual numbers, such as that bonds as they mature will be reinvested. So we will -- I would refer you back to that schedule to get some sense of that impact. So that net investment income will continue to decline for the next several years at least, unless interest rates change. The weather remains very unpredictable and uncertain, so we're going to keep going.\nJosh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division: That's helpful, Jay. The other thing that's surprising about this, just as a follow-up, a couple of years back, it was clear that it was easier to maintain margins and maintain sort of pricing in the soft market in the sort of smaller areas and in personal lines. But it sounds like if I'm interpreting what you guys are saying correctly that I think that there is more pricing momentum to continue in sort of the larger mid-market Commercial Accounts, National Accounts businesses as opposed to the smaller businesses in Personal lines. And I'm wondering if you can talk about one, I guess, if that's right but then also just sort of underlying what that -- sort of how those 2 different markets have diverged and what we all ought to understand about how they operate differently.\nJay S. Fishman: No worries. We tend to think of those markets really in 3 segments, and even that's an understatement of what's -- of what the real environment is, but we tend to think of small middle market individually underwritten accounts and then the National Accounts business. And certainly, over a long period of time, the competitive dynamics in the National Accounts arena, in particularly has been more dramatic than the level of competition in the smallest accounts. In fact, if I recall correctly, I don't think that renewal price change in our Select business actually ever went negative. We should check that but that's my recollection. I don't believe it ever did, and obviously, it did in middle markets. And for those who engage in the real National Accounts business, and I would observe that our participation in that segment is actually relatively modest, that's been the most competitive. So that's a historical framework, I think, around which to think of pricing. For what's happened over the last several years, we have been successful at passing along price increases, both in our small commercial business, as well as our middle market individually underwritten businesses. And I'm not sure that the differences in the ability to pass or at least as measured by rate gains or renewal price change in the small business, I don't think that there's been a significant difference in the ability to be successful in those 2 segments. The dynamics are quite different on the individually underwritten business, it's account by account. It is in many cases, loss driven. It's the experience of the individual account. In Select, you're dealing with class underwriting. And so you're dealing with -- think of it as one with personal lines, a price established for a class of business. So the nature of the underwriting decisions are different but the results are interesting in that we've been successful at getting rate gains in that small end, as well as the individually underwritten business that are largely in the aggregate the same. Do you want to talk about National Accounts at all? Or -- I'm looking at Brian.\nBrian W. MacLean: I mean, National Accounts is a little bit more of a service model. A lot of what we do there, the majority of what we do on the casualty side is all loss responsive. And the market conditions have been such that our service capabilities have been viewed very favorably, and so the pricings improved there pretty dramatically. But -- and we've done really well there. So we feel good about -- we're not a large casualty risk taker in that space.\nJay S. Fishman: And that is an important distinction. We -- our -- even our National Accounts business, we'll write national property on a guaranteed cost basis, we'll do that. Our casualty business, both in terms of liability as well as, in particular Workers' Compensation, is largely in one fashion or another, a fee-for-service business where we are managing a claim on behalf of the clients. So we are not -- as one would think of a guaranteed cost risk taker in the larger end...\nBrian W. MacLean: The risk we would take there would be excess [ph].\nJay S. Fishman: Yes, yes, exactly right. I hope that's helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.\nCharles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Just had a question about the Personal lines business and the change in PIF this quarter. While the retention seems to be holding constant on both the Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners, there's been a pretty significant decline in PIF year-over-year. Wondered if I could just get some more insight on it, just a rate change or a competitive dynamic shift?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, so this is Brian. I'll start. We're clearly watching that closely. So obviously, in our statistics, you can see the renewal book is performing well. We feel great about that. The actions that we are taking and we believe it's very directly tied to the actions we're taking from a pricing, deductible, underwriting perspective, specifically on the last point there on Homeowners, is impacting our new business volumes and our competitive position in the marketplace. And like I said, we're watching it closely and we're going to continue to manage it. But we're committed to improving the profitability there. Jay?\nJay S. Fishman: No, I think you've expressed it right. In the Homeowners business, our sense is and this is a more anecdotal than we can -- than factual. Our sense is, is that the increase in minimum deductibles, in particular, in not an insignificant number of states to really try and bring the policy back to its historical intent is having an impact on new business competitively. It had been our hope, I think, more than anything else that the weather changes that are -- that we're confronting, those are systemic. They're not unique to us. They are systemic in that any thoughtful underwriting-driven company would, in the long run, evaluate how you make a reasonable return in that business. So we've taken steps that we think makes sense for us. We're not going to allow our business to continue from a policy in force standpoint to decline in double digits for long without beginning to take other steps that we might have to take. Now one of those steps is not to reengage in the business and make substandard returns. So we'll have to wrestle with the strategy and how we implement that in the marketplace if what we're doing now strategically and tactically doesn't turn out to be competitively viable, and that's why Brian's comment that we will continue to watch this carefully.\nCharles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then I guess, just sort of a follow-up to that. Any thoughts on how the direct-to-consumer channel is sort of coming along? Or any growth plans to sort of push that line, either advertising or otherwise, accelerate the development of the business?\nJay S. Fishman: Not yet. We continue to -- the test that we're actually continuing to do internally, we refer to as Little America. Our Little America test is -- don't know whether it's 2 or 3 states, but we're actually doing pricing testing in those 2 states, taking states where our agency business was not nearly as prominent as other states, so we can determine the price elasticity of the product and what actions we take and what drives volumes. We're -- we also believe in learning about this that the notion of what I'll call traditional advertising, media-based advertising, that may have run its course. Meaning, we're just not convinced that taking a substantial amount of resources and applying it in traditional media channels actually is going to result in a growth strategy for a business. So we have been deeply exploring digital and the way to drive digital business around it, which we think, at least at this point, has more viability to it and a greater impact. So that's at least a learning in the process that it's possible that American eyeballs are just exhausted from auto insurance ads, and to become another name in that quest may not make a great deal of sense. And lastly, we watch with interest who responds, and we're always wrestling -- not wrestling, that's actually an incorrect word. We are evaluating, is perhaps better, the dynamic of who responds in that channel, the nature of the customer and always wanting to make sure that when we are ready to launch this more substantively, that we really understand the customer that's responding, and we like that customer. And so those are still learning points for us. And until we really feel comfortable that we know what we're doing and we have a likely successful outcome, we're going to keep testing and making sure we wire the thing up properly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: I guess 2 quick follow-up questions. First of all, if I look at Slide 14 for other Business Insurance, it seems that, that exposure rebounded meaningfully over the past few quarters. Can you just sort of delve a bit deeper into the cause for that?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, so this is Brian. A decent amount of that business is property. So it's got our national property business there, it's got our marine businesses there. As I said, insurance to values improved pretty significantly there, so we've had some movement. And some of the other activity in oil and gas has moved there, so it's a couple of specific things. I wouldn't read robust economic growth into it.\nAmit Kumar - Macquarie Research: Okay, that's helpful. I guess, the only other question is going back to the charge regarding to the New York fund for reopened cases. Can you sort of just expand on that? And is that the fund, which will close at 1/1/2014? I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is, is there a possibility as more new claims come in, could there be further adjustments down the line?\nJay S. Fishman: Sure, you're welcome. It's Jay Fishman. And yes, this is the fund that will close 1/1/14 as a result of legislation undertaken in New York. And your question actually is quite relevant. The $42 million pretax that we've provided is an actuarial estimate of the amount of reopened claims that we otherwise would have been -- that would have been seatable to the fund. And as a consequence, we did not build into original loss estimates, loss picks, if you like, in our Workers' Compensation business. And now that's the best estimate we have, given all the data that we have of the amount that will no longer go back to the fund, so we have to provide for the reserve levels. And if in fact the reserve -- the claim activity is different from that actuarial estimate, yes, we will have a variance to that $42 million. Perspectively, it can go up or down, obviously. And -- but the answer to your question is yes, that's correct.\nBrian W. MacLean: There isn't anything structural that will require us to take further action. If our estimate is right, we think we've appropriately assessed the liability.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: I was hoping we could flesh out the audit premiums impact during the quarter. I believe there was a component of healthy growth in at least 1 line. And I was curious if it benefits the combined ratio in a way that we should be cognizant of as well.\nBrian W. MacLean: This is Brian. I'm thinking through the question for a second, but I don't think it has any impact on the combined. As we say on the pages of -- well, I'm looking at the Page numbers, 11, 12, 13, those are illustrative production statistics that we use in managing the business. And particularly in Commercial Accounts, how the true-ups of audit premiums flow through that data develops over time. But from a loss projection -- from a loss ratio perspective, I don't think it has any impact.\nJay S. Benet: I mean, without getting into the details of accounting, we have this thing called earned but unbilled amounts on the balance sheet that's trying to take into account everything we know about the particular policyholders that we have. So there's nothing really about the audit premiums per se that are going to drive a major change to the combined ratio at any given quarter. It's just all part of the entirety of the estimation process. And then as far as the overall level of audit premiums, this year in the first quarter versus last year, there really wasn't a significant change in the dollar amount. So as it relates to premium differentials from one quarter to the next, it's not driving that either.\nJay S. Fishman: We actually make an estimate and accrue on a regular basis the amount of estimated order premiums that we project. And then obviously, as each policy ends and each policy audit occurs, we will make an adjustment to that accrual, either up or down, depending on it. In the financial crisis, what happened, the reason that it became a more substantive issue was that we had never actually seen audit premiums go negative. We were not accruing on the premise that they would be negative so we had significant adjustments then relative to that. But now it's more consistent with historical patterns and is -- so in answer, no. I need to correct one thing I said earlier. I'm reminded by Bill Cunningham who is here. I said that I couldn't -- I didn't recall that select RPC had ever been negative. And in fact, it was. In the RPC in the fourth quarter of '08, it was the -- the others were third quarter of '08, first quarter of '09, it was flat. But fourth quarter of '08, it was modestly negative. So apologies for sort of my memory not being perfect on that.\nMichael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division: That's very helpful. And lastly, so I see -- the Travelers stock valuation has increased fairly meaningfully. I noticed that share repurchases plus the dividend lag net income by a fair amount this quarter. Is that due to the debt repayment? Or should we -- or is there a change in philosophy, perspectively?\nJay S. Benet: No, there's no change in philosophy. As we've said before, there's a lot of timing differentials that take place, as to when you earn the money, what moneys are up at the holding company versus in the operating company, but there's absolutely no change in philosophy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: You guys are actually sitting at your targeted ROEs at least for 1 quarter. So I'm wondering does that -- how does that shift your thinking in terms of managing the business? You're -- even in a low interest rate world, you're getting where you want to be. So how did things change?\nJay S. Fishman: Yes. Greg, we reflect again sort of the same comment I made earlier. The fact is, is that on an accident-year basis, excluding the favorable reserve development, we are not at that level, are going to compounded by the fact that investment income in the fixed portfolio will continue to decline. That's a certainty, unless rates change. And then the third piece is, is that weather remains very unpredictable and the fact that we had favorable non-cat weather in one quarter is certainly not enough for us to conclude that anything is different. So our analysis is largely the same, and so we're going to continue to keep pushing.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay. So in a way, you're basically normalizing all that stuff when you talk about that mid-teens over time?\nJay S. Fishman: We -- I'm glad you said it. The slide is clear, it says mid-teens ROE over time. And I said several quarters ago that, that was not achievable in this environment. And on an accident year basis, I still don't believe that it really is. And as a consequence, we were going to leave it in place as an aspirational goal, I think are the exact words that we use. And that's where we sit today. And as a consequence, we'll continue to push.\nGregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: Okay, great. And then perhaps the only negative thing in a very strong quarter was just -- or just some clarification around the Workers' Comp reserve side. I understand the onetime charge, but there were no releases anywhere across the book in Workers' Comp. I'm wondering is that the first time that you haven't released from Workers' Comp reserves? And should we be concerned that the last couple years have developed unfavorably there?\nJay S. Benet: This is Jay Benet. What I did say was that there was no change, really, in Workers' Comp. I mean, this is the first quarter of the year, and Workers' Comp has a long tail line, as you know. So we're not -- while we look at everything on a quarterly basis, we don't necessarily have adjustment to all of our reserves on a quarterly basis. So I wouldn't read into that other than we put up reserves in the fourth quarter and we still feel very good about where those reserves are, and we'll see how they develop going forward.\nJay S. Fishman: I'd make an observation even though it's not the question that you're necessarily asking. We're sure that somebody was going to ask us about frequency in Workers' Compensation and the loss trend and kind of where things are in that regard, just reflecting back on our comment a couple of -- I think it was actually 2 years ago, 1.5 years, 2 years ago, which is that the frequency dynamic has indeed returned back to its long-term trend line, which is really good. It was the blip that we saw. I think it was in '10. We attributed it to late filed claims, as a result of the financial crisis. But that frequency line has now returned back to its long-term trend line. There's absolutely no guarantee that it will stay there. It may change next quarter, but we were just prepared for that question. We thought someone would ask. So we feel actually quite good about the Workers' Compensation business. We obviously do have a view on what the accident year returns are in the Workers' Comp line across all the businesses, and we are very much on track there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Brian, I know you said not to microscope Slide 15 of the deck on the pricing changes by band. But I'm just curious, for the middle band, retention is down a decent bit versus a year ago, where the -- with the outside bands, it's improved a little bit. I'm not sure it matters, but I'm just curious, do you have any theory what's going on there?\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, I think so. So part of it -- the honest answer to that is probably the middle bar there, in blue, was a little too high a year ago. And as we looked at marketplace opportunity and the profitability on that business, that's 60% to 90% loss ratio business. There's a wide band within that. So as I -- as we try to emphasize, this is a real simplification of how we look at it. And in every one of our businesses, it's at least quintiles. In many, it's deciles. And we're looking at all the stuff in between. So I wouldn't read too much into that dip. A piece of it was I think as we looked at the data a year ago, we began to execute more granularly there and push on the right account. So we actually feel good about the progress there.\nJay S. Fishman: Bill Cunningham actually a year ago said that there was real opportunity or so he thought, particularly in that -- in the right side of this graph the over-90 segment. And if you take a look at what's happened since, it's just -- I mean, the results are just -- you couldn't have scripted them much better. Retention remains at relatively, let's call them, low levels but rate is even higher. So again, just an analytical validation of the strategic and operational approach that he described a year ago.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: Right, very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the direct business. I mean, your statutory underwriting loss there actually declined pretty significantly this quarter. Clearly, part of it was driven by less expense spend. And I'm just wondering relative to your comments earlier, might we be looking for kind of a new base line underwriting result there, thinking about it holistically?\nJay S. Fishman: The result very specifically is a function of reduced national media spending, advertising. As we pursue this Little America strategy, and Greg shared with me it is 2 states, that our media and digital spending has been very targeted because we're trying to generate activity and results in those states so we can learn about price elasticity. And as a consequence, the aggregate amount of spending is down. I wouldn't overreact on a permanent strategic analysis as to what we've been doing these last few quarters. This is a very targeted moment for us to determine pricing sensitivity. And as a result, less advertising spending is needed to generate the results.\nLarry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney: So there's no top-down decision at this point that we want to cut our losses, not eliminate them, but we want to bring down our underwriting loss from this initiative?\nJay S. Fishman: No, no, no. Quite the contrary. We remain -- the best way to answer is we remain committed to the strategy. And as I've said before, we want to make sure that we know that we have a financial success. It is far easier -- I'm not saying easy, but it's easier to have a marketing success and a financial disappointment, and we are guarding carefully against that. And as a result, we want to make sure that not only do we have a pricing profile that is competitive for our brand, but that the pricing strategy there can produce a reasonable return. So that -- it just takes time for sales to occur, losses to emerge and to evaluate the performance of the business. And I mean, we are in no rush. There's -- we're just not. There'll always be another 25-year-old generation that's coming of age that needs insurance, and I -- it's -- granted there's certainly activity today. But we feel strongly, having years and years ago now had a marketing success and a financial disappointment that we're just not going to go down that path. And we just -- just urgency is not -- to go quickly is not the measure here, it's to go successfully.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: Question on reserves and the commentary that the legal environment is better than expected in the '10 to '12 accident years. I just was wondering that's still -- we're seeing that across a bunch of companies but it's still surprising to me that the legal environment was so good in that time, given the economy. So I'd appreciate any color on kind of your thoughts on why that's been the case. Why you've had less exposure legal-wise on casualty lines in that period of time?\nDoreen Spadorcia: This is Doreen Spadorcia. I'll try and answer your question. I'll tell you, we had exactly the same assumption. When the economy started to turn, we were worried about not only that but political environment. So we watched down to the county, what's happening around jury award settlements, et cetera, et cetera. And the best I can give you is we think that the financial crisis probably encouraged people to want their dollars faster. And so there were opportunities for settling some cases that maybe in the past they would have waited to see what the amount would have been. We also took very targeted approaches in certain jurisdictions that we thought we had the ability to set some good precedence. But we've just found that the willingness for people settling has been they want to do that sooner rather than later. Whether that will continue, I don't know. We've also seen cases that have gone to verdict. We saw, again, that there might be some views that this is a bad economy, people need the money, where people on the jury have said, \"This is a lot of money given this economy.\" So even the things that have gone to verdict on some of the kind of GL and other things, they've been more reasonable than we anticipated going into this kind of economic environment. But again, that's just our view.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: But it's not for a lack of effort by the -- on the part of the trial bar though, right? I mean, they're very well kind of financed right now and very aggressive. So it's more people wanting their liquidity. Is that -- I guess, that's the takeaway?\nDoreen Spadorcia: I can tell you there's a lot of advertising still for the plaintiffs bar, looking for different kinds of cases. There's unique financing tools that people are using around big kinds of lawsuits. So you're right in that regard. I just can tell you what we're seeing. So I don't know if that's across the board.\nRandy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division: That's very helpful. Just one more on reserves. And that is on -- it was '10 to '12 that developed most favorably from the commentary but not kind of '08 and '09 and prior. So time marches on and those years are getting seasoned. Is it -- are we getting to the point now where kind of the '08 in prior accident years kind of stopped giving as much from a redundancy perspective?\nJay S. Benet: This is Jay Benet. I just -- we -- I'll answer the question by saying, every time we provide information on reserves, it's our best estimate and we don't have a crystal ball as to how these things are going to develop. I think that if you think of the arithmetic associated with reserving, as years mature, more and more claims are paid, more and more claims are settled. So it's logical to believe that as the accident years mature, there's going to be less development, but you just have to wait and see how these things actually take place. I mean, we certainly carry IBNR for all the years you mentioned. And sometimes, you have large cases that you think are going to cost you x, and they cost you less or more, whatever. So we just have to see. But I think essentially, the less IBNR you have, the less uncertainty you have, all things being equal, the less development you'll have.\nJay S. Fishman: Some of -- this is Jay Fishman. Some observers in the -- of the industry spend a lot of time commenting about reserve development from hard years, hard cycles or soft years or soft cycles, and people who embrace that thinking can come to view that particular years will be more productive than others. We just -- we don't agree with -- at least for us, I'll speak about Travelers. We just don't believe that, we don't do it. We make our best estimates all the time. They are estimates for loss -- for loss estimates are not driven by the revenue strength of that business. They're just not. And so we don't look at any years necessarily as being more potentially productive than others. And as an old year rolls off a new year comes on, and it just keeps going. So it's -- we just don't spend a lot of time obsessing about individual accident years and what they're producing.\nAlan D. Schnitzer: Randy, it's Alan Schnitzer. I would also add to Doreen's response that over that period of time that you mentioned, we also had other developments like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that was really pro-defendant and made some cases harder to bring. Other developments like the Class Action Fairness Act, there's been some important cases in the Supreme Court that I think have been some setbacks in some cases for the trial bar. So I think all those things contribute. We, for example, just had an important win at the Supreme Court on an interpretation of the Class Action Fairness Act, in Standard Fire versus Knowles. And so the cases go both ways, of course. But I think if you look back over the last 5 or 6 years, you'd -- probably on balance and maybe just at the margin, but on balance, a slightly improving environment from the defense side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division: My question had been answered.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with KBW.\nVincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Back to one of your earlier comments about Auto loss-cost trends maybe stabilizing a bit. I'm just curious if you think that this is going to drive -- just that the new found rate competition in the Personal Auto industry. I mean, to your earlier comments, maybe not with Travelers. But is that something you might be able to expect the industry to ramp up on?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, it's Jay Fishman, then I'm going to turn it over to Brian. But my comment about loss stabilization was -- at least mine was specific to Workers' Compensation and it was a frequency comment, where we had seen a tick up in frequency, and it generated a lot of questions over the last several quarters. So I was just commenting that, that, frequency trend was now back in line.\nBrian W. MacLean: And maybe you're referring, Vince, back to my comment where I was talking about Auto severity. And so just to be crystal clear, we had been seeing for -- and this goes back a little over a year ago now, we started talking about a ramp-up in Auto severity. The good news is that, that has leveled off third quarter, fourth quarter this quarter at about the same level but it is still higher than historical norms, so it's not the -- the rate of increase isn't increasing anymore, but we still got severity trend.\nJay S. Fishman: That's actually an important point. When we say leveled off, we don't mean that severity has gone to 0.\nBrian W. MacLean: Sure.\nJay S. Fishman: What we mean is that the rate of increase is more consistent with our own expectations, and to some extent, historical trends, but it is still increasing.\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes. So we would -- we obviously don't know what our competitors are planning to do. We do know that the line, the Personal Auto line of business, has gone from a 94 to 102 combined in the last 6 years in an -- for the industry, in an environment with declining infrastructures. So from a return perspective, it's not the healthiest line of business for the industry. And we do look at the publicly available rate filings of our competitors, and that may indicate some movement upward in pricing, but we'll see what actually happens in the marketplace.\nVincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division: Great. And then winter storm Nemo was -- I mean, at least from a Northeastern standpoint, it was a fairly large storm event but we haven't heard anything about Nemo from really anybody yet this quarter. So is it safe to assume that from an industry standpoint, or for Travelers standpoint that, that was basically a nonevent?\nDoreen Spadorcia: [indiscernible] Is the cat 96 [ph]?\nBrian W. MacLean: I think yes.\nJay S. Fishman: 96 [ph], yes. Cats, 96 [ph], I believe.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Yes, let me just -- I'm going to look that up really quickly.\nGabriella Nawi: You know what, in the meantime, why don't we go to the next caller, and then we'll come back on that.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: Brian, Jay, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your distribution. And kind of what their mood is right now. We're going to the third year of price increases, are they just getting tired of it? Are they accepting of it? What's kind of the new reaction?\nJay S. Fishman: Well, I think the numbers largely tell the story of where [ph] it will go. The senior team here spends a lot of time with agents and with brokers. If you had to do a short summary, you'd say on the commercial line side, the agents feel terrific. They're just -- they're feeling really good and really supported and solid. They believe that they can talk to their customers, explain the rationale. The best remind their customers how long pricing went down and actually do a pretty good job comparing, where even in a lifted environment how that compares to historical premiums. And so they're feeling pretty good. I don't know if you agree with that, Brian, but that...\nBrian W. MacLean: Yes, I do. And we've spent -- in recent weeks, we've been out with agents a lot and talked to a lot of them. I think, again, not to overemphasize the data on Slide 15, but how we execute in the marketplace and really doing it on a granular basis works with them. The more we're having specific conversations about accounts or classes of business, the more focused that is, the better it will be received. The more it's viewed as just a broad-brush approach to the marketplace, the more challenging it will be.\nJay S. Fishman: And on the personal line side, what we're hearing from them is what you see in the numbers, which is that our minimum -- our change in minimum deductibles, our change in underwriting or to some extent, our changes in rate are making us -- causing us to be less competitive on new business. They share with us that the renewal book is fine. And I would say -- I don't know that, that really reflects the mood, but this is a conversation that we have with producers and agents all the time that they're certainly confirming to us that for the moment, the strategies that we're taking in home and in Auto, on the new business side, I would say only, on the new business side only, at least for the moment, is causing us to be less competitive than historically we've been. And we certainly listen to that. We see it in the numbers, and no great surprise to us at the moment.\nBrian W. MacLean: Just -- and so just to circle back on the previous question, just a couple quick comments on the big winter storm that we had a couple months ago. We've clearly gotten some claim volume out of that. It hasn't been outsized. It was obviously contemplated in what we booked in the quarter. A couple of comments: From an Auto perspective, at least up here in Connecticut, Massachusetts and the Northeast, they really shut down the roads a lot, so there wasn't a lot of activity. And the type of claims that we get, the really damaging winter storm claims we get tend to be when there is either really extended events, when the snow sits for months on top of roofs and you get damage there or you get collapses. And fortunately, in this event, although we got lots and lots of snow in a short period of time, it warmed up. It got cleared. And so it just wasn't a tremendous event for at least us, and it doesn't appear to have been in the industry either. So...\nGabriella Nawi: All right. We will -- it looks that this concludes our call for -- I don't think we have any more questions in the queue. So if anybody has further questions, as always, Andrew Hersom and I are available in Investor Relations. Thank you, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, January 22, 2015. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Tina. Good morning, all, and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alan Schnitzer, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Business and International Insurance; and Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond and Specialty Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website, travelers.com. With that, Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you have already seen from our release this morning, we closed out this year with record results. We achieved record levels of net income per diluted share for both, the quarter and the full year of $3.11 and $10.70, respectively. Our return on equity and operating return on equity were also very strong quarter, bringing our full year return on equity to 14.6% and operating return on equity to 15.5%. Just as important is what's behind those numbers. Across the organization, we couldn't be more pleased with how we have executed on our business strategies, including our approach to the marketplace in domestic business insurance, the introduction of Quantum 12.0 and moving our personal insurance business to be better positioned, the continuing evolution of our international footprint and our exceptional positioning in Bond & Specialty Insurance. Just as important is our capital management strategy. In 2014, we returned over $4 billion in capital to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while still maintaining our significant balance sheet strength. Reflecting on our performance over the last 10 years, now a decade since the merger, a few things stand out. When we introduced our long-term financial strategy in 2006, that is creating shareholder value by producing superior returns, driven by building meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages, generating top-tier earnings and capital substantially in excess of our growth needs and maintaining a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and growing book value per share over time, we were confident that it has been successful in the broadest sense beyond our expectations. Over these 10 years, our cumulative operating income has been approximately $31.6 billion and we have reduced our share count by more than 61%, returning $30.7 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and amount exceeding the then market capitalization of the company, and we did this while still making investments that were important for our business and acquisitions that were opportunistic for us along the way. Consequently, we have produced a very strong average annual operating return on equity of 13.3% over that time. Our shareholders have benefited from superior total returns as shown on Page 4 of the webcast, where you can see the 1, 5 and 10-year performance of travelers compared to other U.S. financial companies. Obviously, we posted top-tier returns, but even looking globally we have identified only a small handful of large financial service companies, whose 10-year performance exceeds ours. We remain optimistic about our ability to successfully execute these strategies. Our own observation is that the markets in which we do business remained fairly stable. For the last several years, we have shared with you that while we recognize that we could be wrong, we were skeptical of the concept of the old-fashioned severe insurance pricing cycle, where a bell to go off and it would be a few years of very high price increases and then another bell would go off and there would be significant price declines. Our view was and remains that there are no substantive differences in the way business is conducted that have and we believe will continue to change the characteristics of our markets. We have talked about the stability of the market as evidenced by the high levels of retention, the fact that we are not the only company returning significant amounts of capital as well as the focus of the industry on returns on capital. Advanced analytics and a more demanding regulatory and oversight environment have also meaningfully contributed. While there will always be changes in pricing both, increases and decreases in response to changes in loss costs, expense , interest rates or changes in real or perceived risk, as there are in many industries, we continue to believe that the amplitude of the cycle has narrowed substantially. Beyond the insurance market dynamics, we have real confidence that our organizations is well positioned to successfully navigate whatever set of challenges the external environment may throw our way. With our relentless focus on execution, deep and talented management team, highly analytical approach to underwriting and investment risk and a very high respect for our shareholders' capital, we remain well-positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value. With that let me turn it over to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thank you, Jay. By any measure, our fourth quarter results, record net income per diluted share of $3.11, record operating income per diluted share of $3.07, operating ROE of 17.7% and a combined ratio of 85%, were very strong. As has been the case all year, these strong results were built on very solid investment and underwriting performance. Within underwriting, we continue to earn rate increases in excess of loss cost trends, which was the driver of 100-basis point improvement in our underlying combined ratio this quarter versus the prior year quarter, while experiencing only a modest level of cap losses and very strong net favorable prior-year reserve development. Pre-tax cap losses were $41 million in the quarter, down $12 million from last year's fourth quarter and pre-tax net favorable PYD was $351 million, up $92 million. While each of our business segments contributed to the favorable reserve development, it was primarily driven by Bond & Specialty Insurance's as contract surety business for accident years 2012 and prior. By business and international insurances, general liability product line for accident years 2008 through 2012. As I have been doing in recent period, I would like to provide you with a preliminary view of what our combined 2014 Schedule P is expected to look like when filed on May 1st. On a combined stat basis, for all of our U.S. subs all accident years developed favorably. Looking at the data on a product line, rather than on an accident year basis, all of our major product lines developed favorably in the aggregate across all accident years, except for relatively small amounts of unfavorable development in CMP and in personal auto liability. CMP developed unfavorably by approximately $68 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $3.5 billion, spread out over several recent accident years. Our personal auto liability developed unfavorably by only $20 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $2 billion, driven by development on a small number of large PIP claims from accident years 2005 and prior. I should also point out that the personal auto in total; combining liability and [ph] reserved development was essentially a wash as physical damage developed favorably by $18 million pre-tax. We have taken advantage of the recent evolution in aggregate CAT reinsurance products to restructure our CAT cover, further focusing on severe events that on a single or cumulative basis could impact capital. Effective January 1, we replaced our previous GEN CAT treaties, our $400 million CAT, aggregate excess of lost treaty which expires as scheduled on December 31, and our $400 million GEN CAT treaty, which our reinsurers agreed to terminate early as of that date, with a new aggregate ex-OL treaty that provides coverage for both, single events and accumulation of losses for multiple events. It is a simpler structure that provides $1.5 billion of coverage part of $2 million excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It has a same broad pharaoh and geographic coverage of the former GEN CAT and ex-OL treaties and it positions the coverage layer to provide a significant buffer between earnings and capital. As an aggregate cover, there is a single limit with no reinstatement provisions, the cost is essentially the same as the previous program, but it provides greater potential recovery after the higher retention. Our Northeast GEN CAT treaty, or CAT bonds, earthquake and international covers remain unchanged and I refer you to Page 21 of the webcast for a brief description of the new treaty. Another subject I would like to touch upon relates to the recent drop in the price of oil. While this is not the first time that oil is trading at $45 a barrel, it was at today's levels as recently as 2009, we thought it would be helpful to provide you with the information appearing on Page 22 of the webcast, showing how much of our investment portfolio is invested in the low investment grade energy bonds and energy-related equities. As you can see, the sum of these investments is relatively small and we believe the exposure to be quite manageable. We continue to generate capital well in excess of what is needed to support our businesses and consistent with our strategy, we continue to return very significant amounts of capital to our shareholders. Operating cash flows were in excess of $500 million this quarter, inclusive of a $200 million discretionary contribution we decided to make to our qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows to almost $3.7 billion for the year. We ended the year with holding company liquidity of almost $1.6 billion after returning almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter alone through dividends of $182 million and common share repurchases of a little over $1 billion. For the full-year, we returned almost $4.1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $735 million and common share repurchases over $3.3 billion. One final note about share repurchases, since we began in 2006, the average price we paid for our shares was $57.56, approximately 60% of our current stock price. Once again, all of our capital ratios remain at or better than their target levels. Our debt to total capital ratio 21.7% was well within its target range. During the , book value per share increased 1% and adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was also up slightly. For the full-year book value per share increased 10% and adjusted book value per share increased 7%, while net unrealized investment gains were almost $2 million after tax at the end of the year as compared to $1.3 billion at the beginning of the year. Now, let me turn things over to Brian MacLean\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Alan and Doreen are going to go over the individual segment results. Before they do, I want to make a few comments about our business and I will start with a significant progress we have made in personal lines. Three years ago, we discussed with you that we would be aggressively pursuing improvements in our financial returns in both, auto and homeowners primarily due to weather and auto severity trends. As we close out 2014, we couldn't be more pleased with the progress that we have made. We have taken necessary rate in both, our home and auto products while maintaining strong retention levels and we have tightened underwriting guidelines and made changes to terms and conditions in our homeowners' book. We also discussed that the increased utilization comparative raters by independent agent had resulted in a need to improve our competitive position in the auto market. To that end, we announced our production initiatives that would support the rollout of our new more competitive auto product Quantum Auto 2.0. We have now achieved our expense reduction goal and Quantum 2.0 is live in virtually all Quantum states. The impact from these bold actions on our results has been significant. Our homeowners' returns are in line with our target range and our top-line trends are improving. In auto, our returns are operating in a range that is acceptable to us given current market conditions. Importantly, our auto business is growing again and the higher new businesses creating long-term value, so overall, great progress in the independent agent channel. In the direct-to-consumer business, our decision to enter that channel reflected our belief that a large segment of the personal insurance market empowered by increased transparency of product and pricing information, would choose to buy insurance via the direct channel. While certain customer segments of this market have quickly embraced the direct channel, the customer demographic that Travelers target has moved more slowly. With that said we remain committed to the strategic channel and expect that over time it will become a more significant portion of our personal business. It is important to note that as we have invested in this channel, we have consciously targeted that investment to help strengthen our independent agent channel, which we believe, will continue to be a significant channel for our customer demographic, so we feel very good about this investment. The final point I would make in personal lines is the growing importance of the home product. Our industry is built around protecting consumers against risk, the greater the risk, the greater responsibility and opportunity we have. In that vein, the extreme weather volatility has added risk to the home exposure, making our industry-leading capabilities in the homeowners' line and even more significant competitive advantage and critical with the customer segment we target. Accordingly, we are continuing to invest to make sure that we maintain and leverage our industry-leading product as a part of a total customer portfolio solution. All-in, we feel great about the progress we have made in this business, we are proud of the many employees that have had a hand in executing these initiatives and we are grateful to our agents who have supported us throughout. In our commercial businesses, we are equally pleased with our progress, specifically seen in the steady improvement of our product returns which have been the driven by our consistent execution. As Jay Fishman, mentioned in his comments, we are encouraged by the continued stability of the market as evidenced by the strong retention levels we continue to see both, in our book and across the market. When we analyze our results at a very granular level, we see that we continue to be successful executing our basic pricing strategy which is to retain a high percentage of our business that is meeting target returns, improve profitability where needed, and quote on and write new business that meets our target returns. You will see in our results that we have had a bit more success last quarter in new business, but I would emphasize that that is a function of the improved returns on accounts we are seeing, and not a change in our appetite for new business. Alan will comment on this further, so overall, great results in 2014 with stable market conditions, very strong underwriting results. With that I will turn it over to Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. For business in international insurance, our fourth quarter performance capped off a very good year, with operating income of $630 million in the quarter and more than $2.3 billion for the full-year. In terms of production results, in the U.S. retention rates increased throughout the year, stable renewal premium change reflecting gradual declines in renewal rate regain and improving exposure. We are very pleased with our execution in the field and I will comment more on that in a minute. For the full-year, the underlying combined ratio was strong 92.8%, a half-point improvement from the prior year. While earned pricing in excess of loss trend contributed favorably to year 2014 results, there was also negative impact of about 1.5 for non-catastrophe weather and large losses relative to the prior year. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 93.9%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. The underlying loss ratio improved 40 basis points driven by the earned impact of price increases exceeding loss trend, partially offset by large losses in non cat weather. Impact of large losses was about a 0.1 in the quarter, arising out of our international business. We see this as a normal level of large loss volatility. Expense ratio was a little higher year-over-year, due to the effects of some favorable expense items in the prior year quarter. Turning to production, we had a very strong quarter in PII with net written premiums up over 6% from the prior quarter, driven by our middle market business and inclusion of Dominion for the full quarter. In domestic BI retention increased to 83%, while renewal premium change increased somewhat from recent quarters and new business was up about 6%. These production results reflect what you have been hearing from us for the last year or so. That is, given the rate gains we have achieved over the past four years more of our business is achieving adequate return, and for those accounts or classes, our primary objective is retention. Importantly, in our domestic BI business, we are on average still achieving flat to slightly positive written rate gains on our better performing business segment. For the lesser performing segments of our business, we are on average achieving written renewal rate gains in excess of estimated loss trends. Let me comment on the growth on new business in middle market, both Jay and Brian commented on the stability in the marketplace. As a consequence of that stability, the number of requests for quotes on new business has also been relatively stable. However, given the cumulative impact of rate gains in the market broadly over the past four years, a modestly increasing percentage of the new business request that we did see in the quarter, where return levels that met our threshold. As a result, in the quarter we were able to quote successfully on more accounts. The new business growth in the quarter does not reflect any changes of our return thresholds or more aggressive new business pricing. Looking at the production statistics, I would like to highlights some further detail. In select, retention was over 80% for the second consecutive quarter, with total renewal premium change of a little over 8%. In middle-market, retention was above 84% for the second consecutive quarter and renewal premium change was strong and increased slightly from the third quarter, a great result. In our other domestic BI business, we were pleased that both rate and exposure increased from the third quarter, resulting in 100-basis point increase, sequentially, in renewal premium change. Also, our retention increased to 81%, the highest level in more than two years. Looking at our production results for international, retention was strong at 82%, slightly higher than recent quarters. Renewal premium change was higher than the third quarter as exposures improved. New business was down year-over-year, primarily because the new business we saw did not meet our return threshold. In December, we were pleased to announce that our joint venture with J. Malucelli in Brazil, agreed to acquire a majority interest in Cardinal, a start-up surety provider in Columbia. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. To sum it up, we are very pleased with our strong operating income and production results for the fourth quarter and the momentum we feel going into 2015. In terms of execution going forward, we intend to pursue more of the same. With that, let me turn it over to Doreen.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Thank you, Alan. Good morning to all. Bond & Specialty Insurance had a great quarter, rounding out a strong 2014. Both, the fourth quarter and full-year results, are record earnings for the business and we are very pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the fourth quarter, operating income was $216 million, 24% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013, while full-year income of $727 million was 27% higher than 2013. The increases from prior year were predominantly driven by the higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development that Jay Benet referenced earlier. The underlying combined ratio for both, the quarter and full year were strong at 84.1% and 82.2%, respectively. The quarter was slightly higher than 2013, due to a modest re-estimation of prior quarter losses. The full-year result was 2.5 points better than 2013, due primarily to benefits from existing our management liability excess of loss treaty. While there will always be some ups and downs in the year-over-year variances. I cannot emphasize enough how terrifically feel about the results, in particular the underlying fundamentals of how we achieved them. As with all of our businesses at Travelers, we remain committed to superior underwriting performance of our portfolios through aggressive management of risk and limits, including enhanced segmentation, underwriting analytics and claims management. Turning to production, net written premium for the quarter was $525 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year, due to the exit of our management liability excess of loss treaty in the fourth quarter of 2013, which increased that period in net written premium. The non-renewal of this treaty in 2014, together with higher surety volume, drove 4% increase in net written premium for the full-year. Across our management liability businesses, retention of 84% was consistent with recent period in the prior year, while new business premium of $36 million was generally consistent with recent period. Renewal premium change, which can be somewhat lumpy due to variations in things like limits, written liability, attachment point and policy duration, was 5% for the quarter. In sum, I would like to reiterate one more time just how great we feel about the business and our ability to continue to produce superior financial results. I will turn now to personal insurance, where I would first like to reiterate Brian's comments about the progress made in the business and how great we feel about our ability to have a vibrant consumer business that generates appropriate returns. We had a great fourth quarter rounding out a strong 2014. Operating income for the quarter was $242 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2013, while underlying income of $254 million was up 18% for the quarter from the prior year, driven by strong underwriting results. The underlying combined ratio of 84.3% in the quarter was an improvement of 4.5 points from 2013, while the full-year underlying combined ratio was 86.4%, an improvement of about two points from 2013. The improvement in underlying results from '13 for both, the quarter and full year, reflect continued benefits from earned pricing exceeding loss trends and our expense reduction initiatives. Before addressing the specific results for auto and homeowners, I wanted to give some detail on our expense reduction initiative. You will recall that our plan was to achieve pre-tax savings of $140 million on a run rate basis by 01/01/2015, and we are pleased to tell you that we have achieved that goal. As we have discussed in the past, about half of these reductions relate to claim management expenses, the impact of which shows up in the loss ratio. Since we started the program in the third quarter of 2013, there is about $100 million in cumulative pre-tax savings already in our earnings through the end of 2014. For the remaining $40 million, initiatives have already been executed and they will earn through in 2015. With this specific initiative met and now behind us, please rest assured that we will continue to manage expenses diligently as we always have. Looking at agency auto, retention remained strong and consistent at 83%, while renewal premium change was about 5%. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to drive improvements in production, with new business premium of $161 million in the quarter, 87% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and overall net written premiums increased 4% for the quarter. We have also seen increases in policies enforced on a sequential basis for two consecutive quarters now. Turning to agency auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 97.9%, an improvement of about four points and was 95.9 % for the full-year, an improvement of just over 0.5 for their comparable 2013 period. These improvements were driven by benefits from the expense initiatives and earned pricing exceeding loss trend, partially offset by the higher impact of new business volumes. In addition, the quarter included approximately 2.5 points of favorable prior quarter re-estimation. Lastly, on auto, our current view of the overall auto loss trend remains at about 3%, with no meaningful change in the underlying texture. Looking at agency, homeowners and other, production was strong in the quarter, with retention stable at 84% and renewal premium change of about 6%. New business premium of $83 million was up almost 40% from the prior year quarter and we remained focused on maximizing our market leadership position in the homeowners' line to provide broad consumer solution. From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 69% was an improvement of more than 5 points over the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by earned pricing exceeding loss trend and favorable losses including non-cat weather. Overall in personal insurance, a terrific finish to 2014, and we feel great about our momentum heading into 2015. Finally I would like to echo one of Brian's earlier comments, and this applies to all of our employees, in all of the businesses. We are very proud of the hard work of all of our employees and grateful for the partnership with our agents in achieving these results. With that I will turn the call back to Gabi.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Tina, we are now ready for Q&A. I would ask you all to please limit yourselves to one question and one follow. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Randy Binner of FBR. Please go ahead.\nRandy Binner - FBR: Great. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch on the commentary around rate increases now moving below the increase in exposures. I appreciate the commentary that, I think you think you feel like you are getting rate ahead of loss cost and you are more focused on retention there, but a couple of questions. One, I assume there is going to be competitive profits to keep retention, so any new initiatives there or any more color on how you plan to keep retention higher. Then, as far as the absolute rate increase number we all watch so closely, I guess, I mean, is by definition we have to see that continue to moderate if you are achieving the rate adequacy.\nJay Fishman: Hi. This is Jay. Alan and I, I think, we will tag team this. First, just to be clear about rate gains, first, I assume you are speaking about our business insurance segment. I think, what Alan said was in our best-performing segments of that business, talking really about the middle-market predominantly, but it goes even beyond that. In our best-performing business, we continue to experience, let's call it, flat to upper point in terms of rate. Now, relative obviously an overall loss trend for that segment, it is not keeping pace with it. I would tell you that we are not attempting to. That is not our principal focus. Alan also said that in the poorer performing classes that rate gains there continue to exceed loss trends, so that's where we are. The reason I said we are not uniquely focused on that is that we are a return-driven organization and we ask of folks who have managed this just excellently to remember its agency relationships, its customer relationships and it is how you manage your business over time that matters. We start off with returns over time, that translates to account management over time, so if an account has had, and I am speaking very, very broadly here, but if account has had three years of increases and they have been a good account and we value them, we tell our people that there's nothing wrong with renewing that flat. It doesn't mean that if there's an opportunity to do a little better because circumstances suggest it, claim activity rising or otherwise, but they should attempt to do it, but that we manage our relationships and returns on accounts over time, so I suspect report, I part that if we are right about the cycle dynamics that you will see more of a stair step in rate gains more than sort of a constant trend line and ultimately I suspect with it the granularity of our discussion our best-performing accounts versus our poorer performing accounts will become more relevant in perhaps the way you see the world. Now, that's first part. The second, you spoke about retentions. We are not doing anything differently with respect to retain business than we ever have done and I am sure Alan can give you more color and will, but the way generally business is renewed, if the agent is satisfied, the customer is satisfied, if the market is satisfied, the discussions take place pretty early, well in advance of the renewal date, the account gets resolved at whatever it is and it gets renewed whether it is down a point zero, up a point or differently, so it is [ph] the retention discussions have become as you described more competitive. That simply isn't how the business is done. Those conversations take place given the data and the analytic we have in the context of long-term account management and doing right thing for the customer the agent for the long-term. I let Alan give some more color on that, but there wasn't anything in the world of retention that we are doing differently.\nAlan Schnitzer: Randy, it is Alan Schnitzer. Let me also address both of those quickly. Industry observers tend to focus very narrowly on rate change and the long-term estimated loss trend we give you, and I would remind of comments during the quarter, which is there is a component of price change, which includes exposure that from a return perspective and from margins acts like rate, so we don't look at the narrow GAAP between rate and loss trend may be quite as precisely as industry observers do, and there is always variations quarter-to-quarter in weather and large losses and all those sorts of things that create volatility plus or minus within an expected range, so we are really in a pretty tight band. In terms of retention, I would have given you the same comments Jay did about our efforts, and I would highlight a real competitive advantage that we have. This is not us needing to do anything else. We have got an extraordinary deal capability, we have got great presence in the field, great tenure in the field, we have got great relationships, we have got great related services like our risk control and it is those sorts of things not developed this month or this quarter, but over many years that give us the ability to manage retention in a way that we think is most productive from a profitability perspective.\nJay Fishman: I would add. Again, that is exactly right. It is not uniquely a price discussion. It is important; it is only one element of long-term relationships and management. Lastly, at least through the third quarter, obviously with the first one out in the PC business this quarter retention is what I would consider all the quality companies they are all high. It is not that we are describing a set of circumstances that are unique for us. We think we manage it better than anybody else and maybe that is sort of our own pride in it, but the fact is that it is not our business that has been stable. It is broadly speaking, the industry's that has been stable and that is what so important.\nRandy Binner - FBR: Very helpful. Just one quick follow-up and that is for Jay Fishman on stair step comment on rate. I didn't quite follow how that fit in a conversation, but I think you are saying is the good part of the book becomes more rate adequate. The places where you are trying to seek rate increases may have kind of a bigger impact on a quarterly basis on what we see for rate change. Is that what you meant by the stair step versus the trend?\nJay Fishman: Yes. I did, but the second part of that is that at the account level you may see a year, two years where in an account renew is flat, and then there is an attempt to recover, if you will, some of that loss margin relative to loss trend on that account. We are not a company. We have not issued an edict to the field that says get trend on every account. That would be a dumb thing to do. We say to them manage the long-term return given everything you know about the agent, the account, profile of that account and manage it thoughtfully and if that means that account is going to renew flat for a year or two, that is okay, so that is really the comment about stair step that I was speaking to.\nRandy Binner - FBR: All right. Very good. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJay Gelb: Thank you and good morning. Jay, I know this is somewhat of a sensitive topic and I hope you are feeling well, most importantly. If you could update us on the health condition that was disclosed several months ago, along with any update in succession plans, that would be helpful initially. Thank you.\nJay Gelb: Sure. I appreciate the question. I have no sensitivity about it by the way, none at all, so first, thank you. I do continue to feel okay. I am here, I am on the job, I am still mobile. It's a little clunkier than it was and everybody here is helpful above and the call of duty and making sure that not only I can continue to do my job, but everybody here can continue to do theirs. As I disclosed, and someone asked me why did I disclose it, and the answer is because I needed to, to continue to do the job effectively. It was becoming apparent for those who were around me a lot that something was amiss and it was prior leave people in confusion and doubt or provide some clarity with respect to my circumstance. I have chosen not to be specific about the ailment really in respect of my privacy and my family's privacy and just do not think that it really matters a whole lot. Its relevance is I am 62, there isn't anything about my circumstance that causes me to change my view of my ability to continue work here as I did, I have something else to say, so the horizon is unchanged in that regard. We have been an active succession planning company for a long time and pretty transparently. If you look and see what we have done and what we have announced, it doesn't take a real genius to see what we are doing and what the next generation of leadership here is. I chuckled where 62 is kind of a magic number here Brian 62, I am 62, Jay Benet,62 Bill Heyman is 60-plus, so it is just that responsibility falls on us to make sure that we do this seamlessly, seamlessly. I would tell you that a board knows virtually everything. I have been completely transparent to them, and to the extent anyone really is interested, I have already begun to cut back fairly meaningfully on my non-travelers commitments and I will continue to do that, so that I can focus exclusively maybe, but there [ph] things are not going to give up, but to focus relentlessly on what matters here, so that's the news of the day.\nJay Gelb: I appreciate that. Thank you. Switching gears for Jay Benet, the capital return in 2014 for Travelers was 112% operating income, including dividends and buybacks. How should we think about that for the years going forward?\nJay Benet: There is really no change in the philosophy, there is no change in what we have said in the 10-Ks and Qs, earnings are going to drive what we are able to return subject to the number of items that we list and contributions being one of them. When you look at a particular quarter, you are going to see the ebbs and flows of what has taken place in terms of earnings from prior quarters, making the determination as to how much in particular in that quarter we will be able to return to shareholders, so there is no change in philosophy, no change in the kind of basis upon which it is done, all we were seeing is some excess capital actually that we ended the prior year with, working its way into the share repurchases in 2014.\nJay Gelb: Okay. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nannizzi: Thanks. Jay Benet, I was wondering if you could follow-up a little bit on the development, maybe give us a little bit more color, maybe the breakdown between surety and GL. I am more interested in GL but on the surety piece how much is the non-renewal of that management liability treaty. How much of the impact of that has already come through. Then on GL, just trying to some idea on that '08 to '12 accident years, where are the most recent alternates on those books of business as compared to where you are looking in that business today. Thanks.\nJay Benet: I think some of that is a level of granularity. You will probably see when we file the Schedule P. You know we are in the process of summarizing all that data, so to give a very detailed information at this point in time, I think, would be a bit of a mistake. What we are trying to do is, give the overall picture as to how things have developed and in terms of the individual products, the individual accident years, so what we are trying to communicate was yes there was major shift in anything that affected PYD. As far as your specific question on the surety reinsurance, that has no effect on development. That's a contract that was in place that was looked at in terms of its cost benefit and we decided that it was not really something that was achieving the objectives and from a profitability standpoint and a risk standpoint, we would be better off not having it, but that really had nothing to do with PYD.\nMichael Nannizzi: Okay. Thanks. Then just on expenses, the ratio in BI kind of dropped in the back half of last year and kind of stayed at that level first part of this year and now we have risen now to 32.5-ish range. Where should we expect to see that? I mean, is that where, you know, I am thinking about whether it is Dominion or something else? I mean, is there an opportunity to kind of bring that back down to what we were seeing over the trailing 12 months in the second quarter or is that where you expect to efficiently run? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: It is Alan again. If you look at the full year expense ratio, I think it was 30, 31.5 and that had a benefit in it from the first quarter that we disclosed then. That was on the year worth about half a point. If you adjust that first quarter event and have that half point again, round numbers that sort of what we feel like would be a fair run rate.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Sorry. The benefit, remind you also workers' compensation state assessment liability that we talked about\u2026\nAlan Schnitzer: We had a reduction in estimated liability that we announced in the first quarter and we quantified it, so you will see it in our press release and 10-Q for the first quarter, so that really was the anomaly this year, so if you add that back in and look at the full year, round numbers I would say, it is always going to be up or down a little bit for one thing or another, but that will give you sort of a ballpark.\nMichael Nannizzi: Got it. Great. Then last one for Jay Fishman. Is there anything that you think could happen in the reinsurance market as far as evolution or innovation that would allow you or how you to consider pursuing more growth in catastrophe exposed areas utilizing reinsurance or is that something at this point that is still not something that you foresee. Thanks again.\nJay Fishman: Sure. It is irrelevant question of course. First, we are engaged, involved and looking at lots of different things. The specific question you asked is, are you prepared to build primarily exposure and rely on a reinsurance profile that may or may not be permanent to produce an effective loss profile and there is the potential of mismatches there are substantial. Meaning, on the primary side very difficult to non-renew. Reinsurance, obviously, to be non-renewed instantly, when that happens, even if you pursue a primary non-renewable strategy, that 12 months where you had to think where the primary exposure sits and the reinsurance is simply not there anymore, so that is an arbitrage that I think as a potential mismatch to it that's concerning. Now, if reinsurance pricing were to drift low enough, in my judgment it is not there yet, you might sit there and contemplate doing that, but I would say that the mismatch risk there has real shareholder value attachment to it as well as regulatory. I mean, imagine trying to non-renew a significant enough book of business, where you would actually do this as a strategy as opposed to an operate tactic. It would be very disruptive, so I think not in that regard, but it doesn't mean that there might not be other opportunities and we are sure pushing it around. It is not obvious to us yet. Pluses and minuses, these things will have certain complexities to them, but it is not obvious to us yet that there is some magic, a dynamic there that has happened, the changes, the fundamental underlying economics of being the primary business. Now, maybe it keep going in that direction, but - not yet.\nMichael Nannizzi: Great. Thank you so much, Jay.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Stirling of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nJosh Stirling: Good morning, Jay. Glad you brought up the St. Paul Travelers' deal. I think it is really interesting topic for us to talk about today. Going back 10 years, people were not sure about the deal, but it has obviously been a fantastic success. As we are seeing a new wave of consolidation, I am curious to hear your perspective on the M&A we are seeing in the market today? When you think about the opportunities you guys are presenting, I am sure you have had a lot of opportunities to consider and debate this, and I am wondering more specifically, you have made a couple of smaller investments in the past couple of years. Should we expect you to do more of these as stock buybacks become more expensive in your multiple runs or alternatively should we expect you potentially to be more of a material consolidator in the small and mid-cap consolidation rate that seems to be starting? Just would love to get a sense how you think about capital priorities here.\nJay Fishman: It is a really good question, so let us break it into a couple of component parts. First, on the international horizon, to the extent and the Columbia situation was a pretty good one, I think, Dominion even though it was a $1 billion trade, to the extent there are opportunities to do things of that nature, where a business is either relatively new or underperforming and we think that collectively locally and what we bring ourselves, we can improve it, we will continue to look for those opportunities. It is they are increasingly harder to find, driven in some measure by the economics. Much of the economic environment outside the U.S., as well as the general competitive environment that exists outside the U.S. There are lot of areas where you would say kind of the last thing you want to do is, be competing there, and that was just not been in significant list, but nonetheless to the extent that opportunities present themselves in international front, we will we will most certainly look at them. I would not contemplate, by the way I could be completely wrong here. Meaning, you are asking me for an outlook, I am giving it to you today, that doesn't mean that we could change, but I would not contemplate that those would be large transactions. I do not know how one would look at Dominion. I do not think of it as a large transaction, meaningful, but I would not contemplate that international front, what would be that. We really have no interest in the reinsurance business in the broadest sense, so to the extent that there are the things happening in the arena Bermuda or otherwise, we largely do not pay attention to it and I do not really have a view on the value that has created there. I am not knowledgeable I am not close enough to it to have a thoughtful view. We have always said about acquisitions and this hasn't changed. It is very, very much the same. We are a return-driven organization, the principal view that we would take for looking at anything is what would it do to our return profile over time. Would it potentially improve our return dynamics and that could be either in magnitude or in volatility. To the extent there is diversification, geographic expansion and providing lower volatility returns that could meet the threshold also. The challenge for us in that regard is that, when you do something small in our business, you take all the risks of whatever it was, whatever undisclosed liability, whatever policy was written 20, 30, 40 years ago, you have got it. In many cases, the controls and procedures and knowledge base that exists in small companies just did not [ph] to warrant the risk they could take to getting into it. They just don't have the database that gives you a sense of comfort, when you are spending your shareholders' money that it is wise. In the larger transactions, given that we are such a high return organization, relative to the industry, it is hard to find at a price that can be achieved, a transaction that would meet that return threshold. They would [ph] for sure, but that is interesting, but not highly relevant. We are big enough, we do not need to be any bigger, but we are driven about returns, driven by them. If something significant were ever to be available, we would look and we would look hard. I do think that we are really good. By the way, at the front end at the back-end meaning - that goes on, when we look at something. Then, once we decide to proceed the execution side and a complex and complicated transaction, I think we are pretty good at that and I am speaking out for what is what people know in the marketplace, but also what you don't know. The things that we have looked at, the things that we have walked away from, because our own due diligence suggested no, that is not for us, so it's good. I think the challenge will be meeting all those standards. That doesn't mean we do not roll up our sleeves and dig in and we will continue to try, so but again that's my answers [ph] I can give you.\nJosh Stirling: That is helpful, Jay. Thank You. If I could sneak in a quick one on pricing, so look I get that it used to be very cyclical industry and you have become much more data-driven and the company is more disciplined. If you are in the trenches in you are an actuary and underwriter, should we be expecting that generally a good - be able to cover their cost over the next couple of years, raising pricing you know 2%, 3%, whenever that entails or is that just kind of unrealistic, but it is still competition and capacity still matters and basically the market price is going to be driven by the more aggressive guys who probably do not do as good a job managing their business and they cut the market price to reduce margins, and sales and shift top-line growth?\nJay Fishman: I am always hesitant to speak for any other company, because I can only from the outside in proceed how you are manage their business, but I can speak to what we do and how we run our business. Underwriters will do, good ones, will do with precision what you ask them to do, so you better be really good at knowing what you are asking of them. We have taken the view, when I might - from the outside looking in is that we are not unique in this regard others too. If you tell an underwriter grow, they will. We don't tell them that, we tell them to find thoughtful ways to deploy capital. If they cannot, it is okay. It's okay. No one will ever be asking you why they did not meet their volume budget, because first time you asked them that they will meet at the next quarter and all of us understand that you would never speak to loan officer that way at the back. You would not say to a loan officer here is your volume goal and the torpedo is full speed ahead. If we do not perceive that there is a lot of difference between that risk profile and speaking to field underwriter, so we value their judgment and their insight and the data and analytics that we have in front of them to make thoughtful decisions to own the account, to think about do I want that account in my portfolio for the long-term, and what will it do to the return of my portfolio in a collaborative environment of the type that we have here. Really I cannot underestimate, I cannot overstate rather, I am sorry. I can't overstate how different that is than it was 20 years ago. It is just quite different. I think most importantly is that the feedback loop between what goes on in the field and what is really - knowledge at the home office to ways going on is stunningly shorter than it was 20 years ago, so the ability to act and react to changes not just cyclical big time changes, but local changes on offices, on market, on company in a local place is just that much better. I believe, again, I could be dead wrong. I think that the cyclicality of our business is and will be meaningfully reduced. Anybody who has tried prices are up now let's grow, I can't think of one company that has successfully executed that strategy in any meaningful way. If you look at history, it becomes difficult to say, boy that is a smart thing to do. I think the people who manage our businesses understand what it means to manage your risk profile and as a consequence they will do so. Now, on a given year, where we seek a - we will receive if long-term, if loss trend is 4%, we would be stupid to tell underwriters they got to get 4% on every account. That means we are losing accounts that don't need 4% in their returns and we will get 4% on those accounts that we - so we say to them be return-driven with that account, be smart, be thoughtful and be return-driven and it has worked for us. I think if there is anything about our results over these particularly last five years, I think that many industry observers have not appreciated how productive that approach can be to profitability improvement. Getting the right rate on the right account is really what it is all about. I think more and more people are beginning to understand that.\nJosh Stirling: Thank you, Jay.\nGabriella Nawi: Tina, next question, please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJay Cohen: Yes. Two quick questions. Maybe the other one a little bit last, quick. Since we have had a notable drop in interest rates, if you can give us a sense of what the new money yields look like for your portfolio versus the portfolio yield today?\nBill Heyman: Well, Jay Benet has given you an idea of what our expectations would be over the next two or three years due to the drop in interest rates. We did that in the back of the envelope last night that is already, but last night the new money rates were about 50 basis points lower than the rates Jay was using in making his calculation which would equate to about $20 million after taxes of lower earnings, $20 million a year, the delta. This morning the tenure rate is up a little bit, but that $20 million is $15 million or $16 million, but there is no question that these rates are lower. Last year, as we look at our investment results, which including 2013 much to our surprise, they did so notwithstanding the fact that their rates were lower than our projections at the beginning of the year. We made for this year a new set of projections, which already looks 22 days in, but we are not [ph] in yet, but nonetheless about $20 million a year different.\nJay Fishman: That\u2019s was Bill Heyman speaking.\nJay Cohen: Right. The tenure is actually down a little bit today, but at the end of the call - who knows. Second question, if we could get more color on international price change. We saw the premium change, but obviously I think exposure, but what's happening from a pricing standpoint in your major international markets?\nJay Benet: I do not have this slide in front of me right now, but I think it is in the webcast. You are talking about rate internationals?\nJay Cohen: Yes.\nAlan Schnitzer: I would say what is there in RPC is split probably pretty evenly between rate and exposure.\nJay Cohen: Okay. You are still getting overall increased internationally?\nAlan Schnitzer: We still have an overall positive renewal rate change in international, yes. The other thing I would tell you about our international relative to U.S. is our outlook for loss trend in outside the U.S. it is lower in the U.S., because we do not have the same level of exposure to the medical inflation.\nJay Cohen: Got it. Is that being helped by Canada, the rate change?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. I would say the rate in Canada is a higher end of the spectrum.\nJay Cohen: Got it. Thanks Alan.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. Tina next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney Capital. Please go ahead.\nLarry Greenbergs: Good morning. Thank you. I am just wondering if you can characterize how non-cat weather and large losses came in for the full year 2014, relative to what would be viewed as normal?\nAlan Schnitzer: It's Alan Schnitzer. I do not know if you are talking about business insurance, but I will started in and turn it over to Jay maybe for a - if we grew cats, did you say cats\u2026\nJay Fishman: Non-cat\nLarry Greenbergs: The stuff that would flow into underlying...\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Certainly above expectation and above the prior year.\nJay Fishman: Yes. I think when you look at the entire company, because this is going to be yes, it is like what you are asking if that large losses non-cat weather, they are going to be episodic, there are going to be dependent upon geography and things of that sort. When you look at the entire company, I do not think that this year 2014 was all that unusual a year as it relates to weather. I am talking non-cat weather now. When you look at BI, when you look at, I am talking non-cat weather now. You know when you look at PI and BI combined, it was probably pretty normal although BI was a little higher and PI was probably a little lower in terms of what they might consider to be normal. I think when you make the contrast to last year, which gets you away from an expectation and gets you into the weather and large loss activity of last year, meaning 2013 versus 2014, now there are I think 2014 was a little worse than 2013, but still a good year. Hopefully that is helpful.\nLarry Greenbergs: Yes.\nJay Fishman: What we tried to do in the press release was to provide you not with the data, because it is difficult to measure these things but to adopt the phrase of normal variability in loss activity from quarter-to-quarter try to accommodate the sort of thought process and get away from the - Now, is it good is it bad, it is going to vary. Hopefully, when you get to a full year, some of the variances is less pronounced.\nJay Benet: It's a challenge for us to estimate normal non-cat weather. It is easier for us to speak about non-cat weather this year compared to last, this quarter compared to last year's quarter, but it has been exceptionally difficult for us to come to what would be a normal non-cat weather numbers, so we have a hard time speaking to it that way.\nJay Fishman: If I could just add, an example of what makes it difficult, you have times when given the granularity of what we look at, you will be looking an information and say well large losses activities is up somewhere. Then you get into and why is it up, well because slips and walls [ph] are taken, but the slips and walls, because of the weather. Yes. It is a very difficult bucketing process to end up summarizing all of this data and what we try to do is give you the concepts of what taking place.\nLarry Greenbergs: Great. Now, that is helpful. Then on direct, I listened to what you had said earlier about continuing to invest in that business. The last couple of years, you have generated statutory underwriting losses of about $100 million from the businesses growing top-line a bit, you are getting a little bit of scale economics probably. I mean, when we think about that over the next few years, is that sort of the normal run rate of what expectations should be? I mean, is there going to be a drop in investment spending somewhere out there?\nJay Fishman: Well, this is Jay Fishman. I do not have a better number if I were looking out and one we are experiencing now and. To the extent markets change, certainly have not changed, obviously our strategy will, but if we start off with the premise that - when we started this investment, we said it. We said we were less concerned than some industry observers if a typical Travelers customer would go to buying direct, but we were not ready to bet the trumpet [ph] and therefore ignore the trends, so the development has been important. It is not apparent to us yet that there are enough Travelers-type customers who choose to buy direct or a direct business is scalable on it owned. It is not that we don't know how to get people to respond or how to quote and had issue, we would become really, really good at that that. It is that the number of people that we would think of as the customer that we seek are not choosing to respond that way, now that may change three or four or five years from now. It is a trend. I don't think it is appropriate to ignore it, so we will continue to develop the expertise and the skill, so that if in fact things change and there is a market opportunity for us, we are in a position to respond and we are not\u2026 The other point I would make and I do not know how to quantify it for you, but I would tell you that the benefit to the agency business, the investment, the technology and the underlying customer reach attributes, the ways customer connects to us, our ability to respond as and as a, I will call it an electronic company, for lack of a better term that has just been invaluable. I don\u2019t know how any dollars it meant in the agency business, but I do know it is important. As I would remind everyone, I am not so unhappy that, that the Travelers' customer has not turned away from the agency channel as quickly as some people though. That is good for us. We have got a very big agency based business that is very profitable. If that change continues to occur more slowly, that is just fine with us, so this is a kind of a hedge your position investment that is necessary, because it is just not clear that it will continue this way, but I would say, yes. That is what I would certainly included if was..\nLarry Greenbergs: Great. Thanks for your comments.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. Thank you. Tina, this will be our last and final question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Thanks. Just two quick ones here. First, one for Alan and Jay, if I look at the business insurance business right now, and we look at the returns that are generating, they are pretty attractive right now. Is there any consideration or thought about having underwriters expand their risk profile right now kind of looking maybe into the E&S market a little bit, I know there are kind of ebbs and flows with the cycles. Also loss trend continues to be pretty favorable, so I think that is an area for growth?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Brain it is Alan. I guess the way we would think about that is, we are always challenging ourselves to think about whether there are new marketplace opportunities, but I would distinguish that from changing our risk profile to do it. If we could find opportunities whether it is in energy or whether it is in E&S or any other market, we would certainly look at it, but that would not involve any change in our return thresholds or our risk appetite.\nBrian Meredith: Got you. Okay. Then the second one is for Doreen. Just looking at the homeowners, continued to see the declines in PIF, any thoughts on when that could start to stabilize or maybe start to trend upwards and what impact do you think the decline in PIF in the homeowners business is having on your auto insurance growth here?\nDoreen Spadorcia: Brian. Good morning. I will answer that with a couple of different comments. We put some, as Brian referenced in his comments, due to some of the weather that we were seeing coming through the book and just where the levels of deductibles were and roof issues, we took some pretty strong actions in the homeowners' book. Some of our declines there were deliberate, whether it might be some concentration in some areas, so it was not unexpected to us that we would see some shrinkage. That being said, we feel really great of that we have come through the other side of that where our deductibles are, where the PIF is. The rest of the market probably was not as aggressive as we were in addressing property, but from where we are today and launching forward, we are very excited about that. We feel like we have got just a great launch point on that, because we look at account underwriting, there is no question that when there is pressure on one product, there might be some impact to the other product around either new business or retention. We have seen with QA 2 as we have become more competitive there, that we think that has allowed us to start growing the home line again. We are still in a negative position, but I can tell you that for 2015 and beyond that is going to be a very strong focus of ours, whether it is going to be how we do digital marketing, leading with some of our home capabilities, because we think they are industry-leading, whether it is to look at some different kind of practices in the quote process or an overall customer view, so we can utilize the strength in the property line to actually get not just more homeowners business, but more customer business for the Travelers. We knew that homeowners was going to be, the recovery was going to follow auto, so we are in the spot that we thought we would be and there is a lot of focus on that.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thanks for answers.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. Thank you all for joining us today. As always, I will be available for further follow-up. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read the results this quarter were just terrific, as demonstrated by our operating returning on equity of 15.2%. In addition to posting very strong financial results, the underlying dynamics in our businesses are showing very solid performance and give us continued optimism about our future financial results. Starting with Personal Insurance, Quantum 2.0 is proving to be a real success. New auto business is a clean double from last year\u2019s third quarter and loss experience well still early is very much consistent with our original plans. Retention on our entire auto book remains high, on a sequential quarter basis total auto policies enforce increased for the first time since the second quarter of 2011 and we expect to see sequential policy growth again in the fourth quarter. Lastly and positively, we believe our homeowners business is actually showing some lift from Quantum auto. In our Business Insurance segment its business as usual. We continue to achieve rate gains were needed and we see no fundamental change in the competitive environment that is trends remain generally the same. Retention is actually up in almost all of the business units and we remain optimistic about our ability to continue to successfully execute our granular pricing strategy and achieve improving returns. In our Bond and Specialty Insurance business, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased we\u2019ve navigated through the financial crisis in the great recession as successfully as we have as evidenced by consistently strong results. This performance demonstrates the underwriting thoughtfulness and skill that are such a part of the fabric of our organization. And we\u2019re particularly proud of our investment department performance in a challenging environment they\u2019ve maintained their investment criteria and done the right things, another example of our discipline. Well it\u2019s always nice to post a strong quarter; I think it\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re committed to running this organization successfully over the long-term. This results that we posted this morning were driven by decisions made years ago that have been translated to successful marketplace strategies. Our long-term performance is really the result of [indiscernible] analysis, our commitment to analytics, insightful discipline applied to a risk taking business and to be candid a little bit of good fortune. Our energy is going to be committed to two things, first more of the same, first rate execution of thoughtful data drive strategies; second notwithstanding the more of the same approach, we are also committed to challenging our own conventional wisdoms to identify opportunities and making the decisions today that are necessary perhaps even critical to making sure that our financial performance remains top tier. In addition to hearing from Jay and Brian this morning, Alan and Doreen will provide the commentary on the performance of their business segments. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jay. We were very pleased with our results this quarter with operating income per diluted share of $2.61 and an operating ROE of 15.2% driven by very strong underwriting and investment results. Underwriting results benefited from a slightly lower level of catastrophe losses this quarter, $83 million pretax is compared to $99 million pretax in the prior year quarter. In contrast to the lower level of cats, we incurred higher non-cat weather related losses this quarter, as compared to the prior year quarter, which more than offset the benefit of earned pricing increases that exceeded loss cost trends in each of our business segments and drove a slight 0.5 point uptick in our underlying combined ratio. Underwriting results also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of a $113 million pretax down from a $158 million pretax in the prior year quarter. Current quarter net favorable prior year reserve development included a $250 million pretax increase to our [indiscernible] reserves driven mostly by increases in the company\u2019s estimate of projected settlement and defense cost related to a broad number of policyholders due to a higher level of litigation activities surrounding mesothelioma claims than we\u2019ve previously anticipated. As well as a $77 million pretax increase in our ULAE reserves that the accrual of interest resulting from a recent court decision relating to the asbestos direct action litigation. On the positive side current quarter reserve development included a $64 million pretax benefit resulting from better than expected loss experience related to an old workers compensation reinsurance pool that we participated in along with another pretax benefit of $98 million that resulted from the final commutation of assumed and ceded reinsurance treaties associated with that pool. Current quarter reserve development also benefited from better than expected loss experience in GL, property and fidelity and surety in recent accident years. And year-to-date on a combined stat basis for all of our subs and excluding A&E, all accident years developed favorably. Overtime, we\u2019ve generated much more capital than what is needed to support our business. This has allowed us to return over $900 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, we pay dividend of a $186 million and repurchase $751 million of our common shares consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. And year-to-date, we returned almost $2.9 billion of excess capital to our shareholders, with dividends of $553 million and common share repurchases of $2.3 billion. Shifting from the current year; let me provide a historical view of how our capital management strategy is performed over time. The Board of Directors initiated the current share repurchase program on May 2nd, 2006 a little over 8 years ago. On May 1st, 2006 the day before the board authorization Travelers market capital was $30.2 billion and we had approximately 696 million shares outstanding. Since that time, we\u2019ve repurchased over 416 million shares at an average price of $56.50 per share issued a net amount of approximately 51 million shares mostly in connection with share-based incentive comp awards, and now have 331 million shares outstanding at the end of the current quarter, a 52% reduction in our common shares. And if you add in the dividends that we paid during this time period, we\u2019ve returned approximately 98% of our May 1, 2006 market cap to our shareholders. We accomplish this all throughout this period while maintaining capital and support of strategic business opportunities such as those in Brazil and Canada, very strong holding company liquidity and modest debt levels. Notably our ratings increased during this time period from already very high levels to industry leading levels. And even after returning all of this capital to our shareholders, our market cap stands at $31.6 billion today. Operating cash flows of over a $1.8 billion we\u2019re extremely strong this quarter bringing total operating cash flows almost $3.2 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $1.9 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total capital ratio of 21.3% was lower than its target range and during the quarter book value per share increased 1% and adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses increased 2%, while year-to-date book value per share increased 9% and adjusted book value per share increased 6%. Finally net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.9 billion at the end of the third quarter as compared to $2 billion at the beginning of the year. With that, let me turn things over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Before Alan and Doreen go over the segment results, I would like to give some perspective on how we view the overall market. And to do that, I will start with returns. We are a return-focused company and, as such, we are pleased with our reported ROE for the quarter and year-to-date. We are especially pleased that we were able to deliver these results and what continues to be a very challenging investment environment, one where 10-year Treasury yields continue to hover between 2% and 2.5%. When we look at our returns below this aggregate level, we are also encouraged. To understand our product profitability, we look at accident year returns at the line level; and at this more detailed level, we are very pleased both with the improvement that we have seen over the last several years and with the absolute level that those returns are at today. There are obviously differences line by line, but overall we continue to see signs of a rational marketplace. Doreen and Alan will go through the segment production statistics, but as we analyze our results at a very granular level, we see that we continue to be successful in executing our pricing strategy, which is to retain a high percentage of our best business, improve profitability where needed, and write new business that meets our target returns. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball and I am not predicting the future, but based on what we see today there is nothing in the market that would cause our ability to continue to execute on this pricing strategy to be meaningfully changed. We are also encouraged that as overall returns have become more consistent with our long-term objective, we have begun to see improving top line trends. We have said many times that volume is never our goal, but that we always seek opportunities to add business that meets our target returns. We have seen improved retention across most of the businesses and higher new business volume in many of them, and we believe that these trends are the result of our strategic focus on delivering meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages in the markets we serve. So overall through the first 9 months of 2014, fairly stable market conditions and very strong underwriting results. And with that, I will turn it over to Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. In Business and International Insurance, third quarter operating income was $552 million. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior-year reserve development, was 94.9 for the quarter, up 1.7 points over the prior year. The 1.7-point change resulted from an increase of 2 points, largely from non-cat weather in both our domestic and international businesses, as well as the impact of the inclusion of The Dominion, partially offset by the favorable impact of about 1 point from earned price exceeding lost trend. We also saw a modest uptick in our expense ratio, mostly attributable to a favorable item in 2013. Turning to production trends for domestic BI, compared to the second quarter, overall retention was up about 1 point and total renewal premium change was up slightly as the increasing exposure more than offset a lower level of positive rate change. Year-over-year, new business was about flat. In Select, we were pleased to see an improvement in retention to just over 80%, with total renewal premium change of nearly 9%. We wrote $92 million of new business, representing a 5% increase over the same period last year. In middle market, as a greater percentage of the business has achieved attractive returns, we have increased our focus on keeping the better -performing accounts. Accordingly, we were pleased to have achieved a 2-point increase in retention to a very strong 85% with positive rate change declining less than 0.5 point, and each case is compared to the most recent quarter. Lastly, new business of $236 million for the quarter grew by nearly 10% as compared to the same period last year. Overall, we feel very good about the production results; but as you\u2019ve heard from us many times in recent quarters, the aggregate numbers don\u2019t tell the entire story. The detail of where we are getting rate and which accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our production strategy. In our middle-market businesses, the data beneath these exhibits shows that on our best-performing business our retention has improved to around 90% and we continue to achieve slightly positive rate increases. On our poorest-performing accounts we are achieving low double-digit rate increases with meaningfully lower retention. These results are consistent with our marketplace strategy. Looking at production results for our International business, retention remains strong. Renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent quarters due primarily to lower rate and exposures in Lloyd\u2019s; and new business was up from the prior year due to the acquisition of The Dominion. Before I turn it over to Doreen, I would like to make an observation about margins. Many industry observers seem to focus overly so, in our view on the relationship between written rate change and lost trend. Particularly with rate change for the quarter of 3.3 points, dipping just below our current estimate of loss trend, which is about 4 points in the aggregate, I would like to point out that underwriting margins are impacted by a number of other factors including changes in exposure, underwriting actions, business mix, the impact of new business, weather, and so on. So particularly with written rate and loss trend in such a narrow band, we\u2019d caution you against drawing conclusions about the outlook for underwriting margins based solely on those measures. To wrap it up, I am pleased with our strong results for the quarter. And in terms of execution going forward, we intend to pursue more of the same. And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Thank you, Alan. I would like to begin by saying how excited I am to again work with Tom Kunkel and his leadership team in managing our market-leading Bond & Specialty Insurance business. Also, I am really proud of the progress we\u2019ve made in Personal Insurance and look forward to continuing to work with Greg Toczydlowski and his team. Now for the results. In the Bond & Specialty Insurance segment, operating income of $165 million was 38% higher than the prior-year quarter. The increase was driven by higher levels of favorable prior-year reserve development, along with improved underlying underwriting margin. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 81.7%, a 4-point improvement from the prior year, primarily due to exiting our management liability excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty as well as earned pricing in excess of loss cost trend across the segment. Net written premium for the quarter was $556 million, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year. Across our management liability businesses, retention of 84% was consistent with recent periods in the prior year, while new business of $34 million was down slightly from recent periods. Renewal premium change, which can be somewhat lumpy due to variations in things like limits written, liability attachment points, and policy duration, was 4.6% for the quarter, up somewhat from the second quarter. In sum, strong profitability through Bond & Specialty\u2019s continued underwriting discipline and market leadership. Turning to Personal Insurance, operating income of $239 million for the quarter was down 9% compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven by lower favorable prior-year reserve development in Homeowners. The underlying combined ratio was 84% in the quarter, an improvement from 2013 of more than 1 point, primarily due to the benefits of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, our previously announced expense-reduction initiative, and lower Homeowners commissions, partially offset by a higher mix of new business. As it relates to our expense reduction, to-date we have executed on initiatives responsible for about 90% of the $140 million run-rate savings target. As we have mentioned in the past, about half of these reductions relate to claim management expenses, the impact of which shows up in the loss ratio. We remain on track to achieve the full run-rate savings by the end of this year, in line with our original expectation. Looking at agency Auto, retention remained strong at 82%, while renewal premium change was about 6%. We also are extremely pleased with the progress we have made on new business production, driven by the impact that Quantum Auto 2.0 is having. New business premium of $166 million is more than double the third quarter of 2013, with 90% of the $166 million coming from Quantum 2.0. This increase in new business drove a year-over-year increase in net written premium of 3%. And, as Jay noted, policies in force increased from the most recent quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2011. As for the rollout, Quantum 2.0 is now live in all but a handful of prior Quantum states; and our expectation is that these remaining states will go live over the next quarter or two. Turning to agency Auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 96.1% for the quarter was an improvement of 1.5 points over the prior year, driven primarily by the expense initiatives and earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by the impact from higher new business volume. Our current view of overall Auto loss cost trend is about 3%, a slight improvement from what we communicated in recent quarters driven by some moderation in bodily injury severity and looking at the improvements in revenue and profitability, we believe our fundamental changes have made our auto product more competitive. Looking at agency homeowners and others production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of about 6%, while retention remained at 84%. New business volume of $95 million was up about 30% from the prior year quarter, due to some lift from higher volumes in Quantum 2.0 overall home production is in line with our expectation. From the profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 70.1% was an improvement of 1.5 over the third quarter of 2013, driven by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend as well as lower expenses. So overall in personal insurance a great quarter with both strong financial results and production metrics and we remain pleased with the results of the Quantum 2.0 overall so far. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Gabi.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Julian, we\u2019re now ready for the Q&A portion. I would ask participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is now open; please proceed with your question.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Thank you. I want to touch base on exposure growth in business insurance. It appears to be accelerating in the middle market, commercial business and select is showing more stable growth. Can you talk about the differences that are driving that?\nJay Fishman: Yes, the difference in middle market versus select?\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Yes, in terms of \u2013 the rate of change in exposure growth being stronger in middle market than select?\nJay Fishman: Yes, the exposure in fact really isn\u2019t from sales and payroll, its \u2013 and if you look at, look at the starting and ending point, you\u2019re probably looking at the webcast. If you look at the starting and ending points, it\u2019s actually a pretty straight line from those two end points. The way we calculate the number, the impact of audit premium creates a different quarter to after we report exposures in particularly in the middle market. And so, we would expect that to develop over time into more of a straight line.\nBrian MacLean: I think \u2013 this is Brian; the other point on select, lot of that exposure growth is values on the property component of C&P.\nJay Fishman: And that\u2019s been an affirmative effort on our part to try to improve the values.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Okay. So any other underlying difference in terms of exposure growth on the small business versus middle market?\nJay Fishman: No there isn\u2019t really, other than on the small side we\u2019ve really been working on the \u2013 the insurance to values and in middle market it really is a function of how we account for the audit premium in the exposures.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Okay. And then I had a separate question on capital return, so year-to-date if my math is right, share buybacks plus dividends are $2.9 billion, operating income $2.6 billion, so clearly capital return running well ahead of operating income on the order around 110%. Can you give and you had a prior comment also saying that there is a continued level of excess capital being generated. I don\u2019t know if you would care to update us on the capital management strategy in terms of could that that gap between capital return on operating income continue to grow over time similar to what we\u2019ve seen this year?\nJay Benet: Hi Jay, this is Jay Benet. Thanks for asking that question. What you\u2019re really seeing is a timing difference in the generation of the excess capital versus the timeframe in what is purchased, its repurchased. So and we look at, particularly year like 2014, one of the things you have to take into account is, how did the end of 2013 come out and it was a very strong fourth quarter and we did our year end capital calculations, we found that we had some excess capital that we carried into this year. So, we\u2019re playing a little bit of catch up now, but there is no change in strategy, there is no change in execution. It really goes back to the words that we used to describe, the program which is, we\u2019re generating it over time primarily through income and maintaining the capital we need to support our businesses. So that the ratings are maintained and the posture of the balance sheet doesn\u2019t change. And then to the extent, we have the excess capital that\u2019s getting generating we\u2019re buying that over time. But it\u2019s really, it\u2019s really driven by earnings. And you have to look at it, more broadly than just a nine month period.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Okay, so based on that we should still generally think about buybacks and dividends being roughly equal to annual operating earnings?\nJay Benet: I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s roughly equal, in our 10-Q and 10-K we talk about having enough capital to support the growth in the business, occasionally we make pension contributions to a qualified pension plan, so there are other things that will utilize capital in the place. But, the creation of capital is from the earnings.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, next question please.\nOperator: Our next comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Great thanks, just a couple of question, in terms of the auto business. We\u2019re trying to figure out, you talked about 6% rate increases and we\u2019re trying to square that with the rate declines that you\u2019ve taken and talked about taking on the Quantum business that you\u2019ve repriced. Can you help sort of square those two things?\nDoreen Spadorcia: Michael, this is Doreen. Are you looking at the webcast with renewal premiums change?\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Yes.\nDoreen Spadorcia: It would be and also our existing book on the renewal book of business.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Okay. So, for a business that you are Quantum is for new business only, is that so that\u2019s your, okay.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Quantum 2.0 is for new business only.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Got it, okay that makes sense. And then, one question on just on business insurance, kind of looking at the margins there and what is, how much of an impact the year-over-year comparison does Dominion having if at all? And how should we think about, I trying to \u2013 I know you mentioned some non-cat weather but, just trying to parse out sort of rate versus loss trend in underlying margin? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Hi its Alan Schnitzer. On the Dominion as we get \u2013 as we get sort of year end post close we\u2019re going to try to resist the temptation to breakout the impact of that in particular. I will tell you that at least in the current period it\u2019s, leaving out the unusual weather that we\u2019ve had in Canada, the hailstorm in Alberta and floods in Toronto. But leaving that out the Dominion was probably about a half a point on the loss ratio a couple tens on the expense ratio. But, we\u2019d really like to move away from quantifying the impacts of that transaction, just gets harder and harder to do as we enter there.\nGabriella Nawi: Sorry and its Gabi, just to be clear that\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t in the prior quarter, he is not setting a level of Dominion.\nAlan Schnitzer: That\u2019s right.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Got it, okay. Okay, thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Great, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.\nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Good morning and thanks for taking my call. Just on the margin, just to follow on that, is that you mentioned some non-cat largely like a weather related losses. Is that how much, if you can quantify that in terms of how much that to track on the 50 basis point deterioration year-over-year and also is that a pattern where I have seen in the past few quarters, because I guess your peers reported some sort of non-cat large losses in past few quarters as well?\nJay Fishman: We\u2019ve been observing for a couple of years with that the weather seems to be getting more extreme and so this is \u2013 is, consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing over couple of years in quarter weather was worth something like a point and a half on the delta.\nJay Benet: Its Jay Benet, I would add to that, when you\u2019re asking are there trends involved, we are always going to have quarter-over-quarter differences associated with things like non-cat weather or large losses, what we\u2019re trying to do is point that out to give you some insight into what\u2019s taking place. But, I wouldn\u2019t say that in all cases when we say the weather is higher it means the weather was terrible, I mean it\u2019s just higher than it was last year. So, I wouldn\u2019t call this a really bad weather quarter, but last year\u2019s third quarter was actually a little on the favorable side.\nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley: That\u2019s great. My second question is on the reinsurance side. Just given what\u2019s happening in the marketplace in reinsurance, basic pricing coming down, various alternative solutions, and just wonder what is your overall reinsurance strategy. Are you thinking about setting up some alternative structure, including internal or captive reinsurers?\nJay Fishman: Hi, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. We are certainly looking at everything. There\u2019s obviously a lot of activity in that space. We are not a big utilizer of reinsurance, broadly speaking. When you look at the amount of ceded premium that we put out to the marketplace, it really isn\u2019t enough to jump through a lot of hoops and incur a lot of cost to create something that looks snappy but doesn\u2019t really accomplish much financially. So that doesn\u2019t mean we are giving up. I am mindful of the fact that it is getting a tremendous amount of attention, so I have actually been spending some of my own time in making sure I can actually understand it and make sense of it. So far, without a lot of effect, to be completely blunt with you; but we will obviously keep looking. I don\u2019t anticipate for us \u2013 not to say that somebody else. I don\u2019t anticipate that the change in reinsurance pricing in any broad measure will have a meaningful impact on us. Again, not because \u2013 for example, our property cat treaty wasn\u2019t less expensive; it was. But it is just not enough on a premium base of our size to make a substantial difference. I have also been asked whether we would be interested in building a book of business and in effect arbitraging it against the reinsurance opportunity. And I am always mindful that when you take on a risk on the right side of your balance sheet, there is some permanence to it; and the reinsurance profile on the left may or may not be permanent. And you\u2019ve got to be very cautious and careful about not finding yourself in an unreinsured position or in a mismatch, which can happen and has happened. I think back to September 11 and what a bunch of reinsurers did shortly in the days thereafter; and lots of us found ourselves with primary exposure without underlying reinsurance to cover. So there is a lot of moving parts here, and we are sure looking at it pretty hard. But so far I would say nothing that really excites me at least a great deal.\nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Thank you so much for the answers.\nAlan Schnitzer: Michael, let me just clarify, just so we pull these two questions together and don\u2019t leave any confusion here. What we said was there was about a 2-point increase in the combined ratio due to both weather and The Dominion. That was 2 points all in; about 1.5 point of that is weather and about 0.5 point of it is Dominion.\nJay Fishman: And again, just speak to direction, please.\nAlan Schnitzer: Increase.\nJay Fishman: An increase of 1.5 point due to weather and an increase of 0.5 point due to Dominion.\nAlan Schnitzer: That\u2019s right.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Hi. Good morning. The first question is on pricing and loss cost trends. I believe you said not to focus too much on pricing being up at about 3.3% and loss cost trend at about 4%. But just thinking about it at a 50,000-foot level, should we expect a small amount of margin compression next year and also, looking at the loss cost trends, if you could help us understand. I mean peers are looking at loss cost trend in the 2% to 3% range; your 4% number seems a little bit high. Just wondering if there is some amount of conservatism in that.\nJay Fishman: Well, I think perhaps we will split the question between myself and Alan. First, the reason that we are just cautioning against evaluating 3.3% versus 4% is that that arithmetic is pretty easy to do, but doesn\u2019t take into account all of the factors that affect the profitability of our business. We have reminded people frequently that a not insignificant amount of exposure base \u2013 particularly, for example, in our small commercial business, will act as an increase in rate absent a change in loss profile. As an example, to the extent we collect more premium due to inflation adjustments on property, unless the loss exceeds what would have been the previous total insured value level, that increase in exposure functions exactly the same as rate. And so it is easy to talk about a widening margin and I am going to make up numbers here. It\u2019s easy to talk about it when you\u2019ve got, to make up a number, 7% rate and 4% loss trend. And I suspect it would be easy if we were talking about 1% rate and 3% loss trend. But in and around the number, it is just not that precise to conclude that within 7/10 of a point that margins will necessarily contract or not contract. Candidly, I am not \u2013 our 10-Q is going to say in Business Insurance or does; I don\u2019t know if we filed it this morning; we did file it \u2013 says that we anticipate margins to be flat, equivalent, in Business Insurance into 2015. And that is our best judgment at the moment. It\u2019s what\u2019s funny, people seem to think that there is a stunning amount of difference between talking about plus 0.2 versus minus 0.2, but they understand that there is no big difference between plus 2.2 and plus 1.8. It is the same 4/10; it just happens to be around a different baseline number. So our caution is simply to let you know that notwithstanding all of our analytical skill and insight into the numbers, this is getting pretty precise to make arithmetic calculations based on these numbers. We just caution against it.\nAlan Schnitzer: On the second question on loss trend, hard for us to comment on anybody else\u2019s loss trend. But I would suggest you might want to look at mix.\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Just as a follow-up, the Homeowners commission expense ratio was low. I was just curious to why that was. Thanks.\nJay Fishman: Can you repeat the question please?\nDoreen Spadorcia: I couldn\u2019t hear it. I\u2019m sorry.\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Sorry. On the Homeowners, I believe the commission expense ratio was lower this year versus last year. I was just curious why.\nDoreen Spadorcia: We did reduce the Homeowners commission rates. Yes; we implemented those in probably the middle of 2013, maybe a little bit earlier than that.\nBrian MacLean: And some of the expense initiatives we had from \u2013 relative to Quantum was also impacting Homeowners.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Well the \u2013 yes, exactly. So about 25% of our expense reductions fell to the Homeowners line.\nJay Fishman: But the Homeowners commission expense number fell because of a change in the rate that we pay on Homeowners business. We implemented that, again, in the middle of 2013. That is the driving factor there.\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Okay. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch: Yes, just a couple of questions. I guess maybe the first quick one for Doreen. You had mentioned, I think it was the Specialty and professional liability business that you had changed your reinsurance session there, and that helped earnings. Can you talk a little bit more about that? And then separately, asbestos. Surprised no one has asked you yet about it, but another very sizable charge. Can you talk about really what you are seeing there now? It just feels as if this is an annual sizable charge, and you\u2019re almost going on a pay-as-you-go basis, and we should almost expect this kind of charge going forward. I am wondering if you can give more insight into the asbestos.\nDoreen Spadorcia: This is Doreen. I will talk first about the Bond & Specialty Insurance reinsurance treaty, and then I will turn it over to Jay Benet for asbestos. But as I think we reported in the past, the decision was made to exit from our management liability excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty; and that decision was made at the end of 2013. And essentially what you are seeing is that, as we looked at our book of business both from a limit standpoint, the quality of the underwriting, we just felt like the ceded premium didn\u2019t make sense given the performance of the book. And so if you were to look at the underlying combined ratio being up about 4 points, it is about 3 of that underlying improvement. And it is really just looking at what premium you wanted to pay for your loss content. So a great decision was made, and we see it in the results.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Doreen.\nJay Benet: Hi, Jay; it\u2019s Jay. As it relates to asbestos, as you know we follow this very closely every quarter and we supplement the quarterly procedures with, what we refer to is the, very in-depth claim study that gets done annually and we\u2019ve completing it in the third quarter. So what\u2019s going on with the data, first of all every time we, put an asbestos reserve it\u2019s our best asbestos of what the totality of losses will be and as you know there are pages and pages in our 10-K and 10-Q describing all the uncertainties associated with asbestos and what\u2019s taking place, we\u2019re not taking place in the environment. So in terms of the overall environment, I\u2019d remind everybody that, we\u2019ve had the asbestos exclusion in our policies for decades at this point, the product is in use the way it, its formally used decades ago. And the assumptions that we\u2019ve build in to the reserves are that there will be tailing off claims over time based on the ageing population and all the other dynamics to go along with that. So, we are making these estimates and then, periodically looking to see are the estimates holding up in terms of the data that\u2019s emerging. And what\u2019s been happening in the last couple of years and we can come up with anecdotes to perhaps why it\u2019s happening, but what keeps happening over time is that our estimates which are the best estimates of the point in time are proving to a little short as new information emerges. And in talking to our claim people who deal at this and, asking the ageing question, why doesn\u2019t this stuff drop off at the rate that we had expected, some of the anecdotal answers tend to be and I underscore anecdotal that well perhaps we have a situation where, years ago given where, general medicine was at that point, people were dying of different things like heart attacks or forms of cancers and with medical advances, perhaps living longer and by living longer and not buying of those particular diseases, mesothelioma might develop and, suddenly now you have an asbestos claim. So, part of this is, the estimation process, part of this is just, trying to understand the trends that are going on, but I welcome the day when we can all watch a sporting event and not to see a point of certainty, adds you know saying if you ever heard the word mesothelioma call this number. But that\u2019s the environment, but I will say that there isn\u2019t a fundamental change in the environment that it\u2019s not new theories or anything like that its more matter of trying to estimate, what\u2019s actually out there. I hope that was helpful.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch: Yes that was helpful Jay, thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg of Janney Capital. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I respect that you don\u2019t want to get into too much detail on Dominion, but given the fourth quarter will be the first where we\u2019re on an apples-to-apples basis it would be helpful to just know what Dominion is growing at organically and I think when you did the deal, you expected it to be modestly accretive to 2014 and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s coming to fruition?\nAlan Schnitzer: Larry it Alan, I\u2019m just trying to process the questions here. In terms of, on Dominion I should just take a step back and say that we\u2019re very pleased with the transaction the integration is going very well, they are very pleased with the local team in Canada and the way the two teams are integrating and very pleased with the way that the both teams in Canada and our U.S. businesses are integrating. So, I should really start off and I think this is the important message about the Dominion its going very well, there is no surprises and we\u2019re enthusiastic about the deal today as we were and we signed.\nJay Benet: And let me just add in, because it\u2019s a great time to do it. I\u2019m not insignificant a portion of the rationale here was to export and make available in the Canadian marketplace, product and expertise that we had here in the U.S. that had not been developed up in Canada that is still very much the plan. So we are at the early days here, we\u2019re very much at the early days, I\u2019m sorry but that was helpful.\nJay Fishman: Larry in terms of your specific questions, I think we\u2019d really prefer on a business\u2019s size probably not to go down to that level of detail other than to say it\u2019s on track there is, whenever you do a deal of this size there is always some surprises that are a little bit good and a little bit bad that all of those are within the range of expectations and we\u2019re very, very pleased with the transaction.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital: Okay, fair enough.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Al Copersino from Columbia Management. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.\nAl Copersino \u2013 Columbia Management: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you all had available or were willing to share for the bond and specialty segment and for the personal segment. We have the renewal premium change in the slide deck, I was curious if you are able to give us the rate changes specifically?\nJay Benet: It operates on \u2013 Brian and I will chat here, but those businesses in particular, it\u2019s really quite difficult to parse the rate change and renewal premium change, because they operate so much together. For example the policy limits right so, if you got an inflation element in the underlying property for example that\u2019s going to well shift premium, but that happens in many cases in effect automatically. So we don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t track rate and renewal premium change at the granular level that we can in other businesses to provide that breakout. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not an appropriate question, it\u2019s with the business dynamics under it operate differently. And therefore really can\u2019t be parsed with quite as much precision.\nDoreen Spadorcia: And this is Doreen. We do look at it to Jay\u2019s point, but we find the combination of them with renewal premium change to be the more meaningful way to look at the business. And we\u2019d never really disclose that level. So we can look at it, but we just don\u2019t want to make sure\u2026\nJay Benet: In most, yes in most cases in our personal lines of business, the fundamental exposure is not changing and it is the total price change that is really reflective. And Doreen you could talk about the Bond.\nBrian MacLean: You can get, you get changes, but we just don\u2019t parse at that level.\nJay Benet: Bond?\nDoreen Spadorcia: On the Bond side, I would say and we\u2019ve talked a little bit about the in management liability in particular on RPC and rate such as again the Jay\u2019s point of combined concept of what the limits are the attachment point, the term of the policy so we look at them blended together. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t look at them or we just its more meaningful to combine them for us for the business performance.\nAl Copersino \u2013 Columbia Management: Okay, well thank you all. I appreciate it.\nGabriella Nawi: Great, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields \u2013 KBW: Okay great, thanks. Good morning. Doreen, as there been any change in the competitive environment for personal lines specifically auto over the course of the year?\nDoreen Spadorcia: What we\u2019ve seen and we\u2019ve watched this pretty closely to see particularly with our commission changes and Quantum 2.0, what\u2019s going on out there. And I would say in the independent agency channel, we\u2019ve seen some very targeted but, not broad follows in terms of a little bit of people changing commission, a little bit of targeting specifically on price reductions. What we haven\u2019t seen in that channel is anybody really address broadly the cost structure. And so, no it\u2019s not a major change, we just continue to watch it.\nMeyer Shields \u2013 KBW: Okay, that good news. Jay you talked earlier about the other factors that can drive margin improvement aside from the gap between rate increases and lost cost trends. I was wondering are those other issues is that expected trends changes it all?\nJay Fishman: Meyer I don\u2019t, is that \u2013 is that expected trend changing it all, help me, I don\u2019t understand quite the question.\nMeyer Shields \u2013 KBW: I\u2019m asking it for the, if the impact of other factors besides the rate loss trend gap and its impact on margin expansion, is that given the improvements you\u2019ve had so far for example in the granularity of pricing and so on should we expect less margin expansion from those other factors going forward that we have for the last couple of years?\nJay Fishman: I got it. The answer is, I sure don\u2019t think so. The reason for the caution is simply because it would be, I think, inappropriate to leap to a conclusion that 4% versus 3.3% will, in effect by definition, result in a narrowing margin. It may; I am not saying it\u2019s not. But there are other factors that go into whether the margin gets bigger or smaller, and you are in the range now of the gap between these two numbers that is, loss trend and rate to be such that these other factors, which always operate, they always operate, could actually produce a different outcome than the simple arithmetic would demonstrate. And again, the example I used before, with a rate of 7% and loss trend of 4%, this is just a loss treat of only [indiscernible]. It is an easy call. And with loss trend of 4% and rate of 1%, it would also be an easy call. But you are at a range now where it is not an easy call. I am not saying from the outside looking in, by the way; I am saying even from the inside it is not an easy call to absolutely say it is going to expand or it is going to contract. It is on the line, in effect, right now, and we don\u2019t know how to be any more precise than we are being with you. This is as good as we have to offer.\nMeyer Shields \u2013 KBW: Okay. I understand. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Good morning. Thank you and congratulations on the quarter. Just recently I was doing an agent tour, and they were talking about a little bit more aggressiveness in the spread between new business and old \u2013 and renewal business on the commercial business. I wanted to see if you perceived any change there in that, either in Travelers or in the marketplace.\nAlan Schnitzer: Hey, Paul, it\u2019s Alan. Let me comment on us; and I am not sure we are going to comment more broadly on the market. But it\u2019s always dangerous, I think, to take one conversation with an agent and extrapolate from that. I would say from our data we see that over the last couple of years, seven or eight quarters, there has been a pretty consistent gap between new and renewal. But if you look back over a longer period of time, I would say that gap is reasonably tight at the moment on a longer-term view.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Then as a separate question, it has been a long time since we have talked about some of the direct channels and other experimentation that you have been working on over several years. I would like to know if Quantum 2 is sort of where we are at with respect to what we are looking at for the future of Travelers for the next couple years, or if there are some ongoing efforts still to build out other channels.\nDoreen Spadorcia: This is Doreen; I will just speak to that. So I will tell you that Quantum 2 is definitely a positive for direct-to-consumer as well as the agency channel. It was a product that we thought would be attractive across channels. So as we look at our metrics around conversion and sales, we believe that Quantum 2 has definitely had a positive in that. In addition to that, we always look for process improvements. We have also been very focused on looking at digital marketing and how to use our dollars in a very targeted way for direct. We also have plans, and I think we have talked to all of you in the past. This is not just direct, but we will continue to look at where we can enhance the property products as well as looking at how we bring accounts together; and that will be both a benefit for the agency channel as well as direct.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners: Great. Thanks for the answers.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. And this is our last question. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Hi, good morning, and thank you. Congratulations on a great quarter and thanks for fitting me in. So Jay, pricing has been slowing. It\u2019s come off, what, 3% in the past year; and if you simplistically project forward another year, at last year\u2019s pace pricing probably would be zero or maybe even a slight decline. And so I think big picture, we are all just trying to figure out whether the industry\u2019s pricing decline is going to stop at something like inflation. Does it go to zero, or does it go negative? I recognize you guys don\u2019t want to talk about other companies. But to keep it focused on Travelers, if I understand all the back and forth around the margin outlook and Alan\u2019s comments, I think you\u2019re basically saying that you will keep pricing more or less in line with inflation over the next year or so. Is that right?\nJay Fishman: Well, I can certainly tell you what our strategy is. I have no problem sharing that. And obviously, the ability to execute in a business environment \u2013 we may succeed; we may not. We haven\u2019t changed anything about the way we are approaching individual accounts. I remind everybody of this all the time. Right now there is an underwriter in Kansas City, right now, who is sitting with an agent having a conversation about one account. And they are not thinking about the overall market; they are not thinking about inflation. They are thinking about the return on that account and how do I improve it. So you\u2019ve got to start with the premise that this really does start at the bottom and work its way up. As accounts have become \u2013 as increasing number of accounts have now had several years of increases and are now producing profitability, returns, however, you like to look at it, that really fall into the boy, we are glad we have that account category, we ask our people to be thoughtful, to be judicious about the way they approach every individual account. It doesn\u2019t have to be a straight line. It can be a stair step. It can be driven by the local market. It can be driven by the relationship with an agent. It can be driven by the size of the book that we have with the agent. It can be driven by whether there has been claim problems or not on that account. All of those things go into the pricing of an individual account. Now, what we are trying to get to is a point where over time \u2013 we come back to over time all the time that we manage to offset the impact of loss cost by either rising prices or self-help through efficiency or expense reduction. And I point to the kinds of things that Greg Toczydlowski and the group have done in Personal Insurance. That dollar saved in expense is as good as a dollar raised at the point-of-sale in rate, in fact, arguably even better. And now I will speak really just personally, because I am not sure I am speaking for the whole place. I am hopeful, maybe even cautiously optimistic, that we will not \u2013 and I said this by the way 10 years ago \u2013 maybe not 10, maybe 8 years ago. I personally believe that the property and casualty business will have a meaningfully lower level of cyclicality. Never said zero, but always said a less, lower amplitude of that cyclicality. There are a host of reasons why I believe that. Analytics and data are just one, but a very important one. And I think it has proven on the way down before we entered into this cycle. I think it has been proven here on the way up. I am hopeful, maybe even optimistic, that that will turn out to be true on the way down. We don\u2019t see anything in the way in which business is done at the point of sale in the market that would suggest that we are at a precipice, that would suggest that something fundamentally is going to change next month, next quarter, or frankly even next year. Now, we could be dead wrong about all this; it\u2019s possible we could be dead wrong. But we are focused on over time maintaining our margins. It doesn\u2019t mean that an individual account has to have a price increase every year. It doesn\u2019t mean that in a quarter the rate won\u2019t come under loss trend. I would like to know where the mix of business is that is coming up for renewal. The answer to success for us is in the granular analysis more than the headline numbers. So that\u2019s honestly how \u2013 we\u2019re never anything but honest \u2013 but that is how we see the marketplace environment. That is how we intend to operate. We will see if it sustainable. Again, I am hopeful and maybe even optimistic. There is a thoughtfulness. We understand \u2013 but we are not unique in this \u2013 we certainly understand the world of risk-taking. I have a lot of respect for a lot of other companies out there because I see how they operate, and they also have a great respect for risk-taking. And that I think is kind of different than it was perhaps 15 years ago. There is a different level I think of understanding and perception of what it means to commit your shareholders\u2019 capital to a risk or a series of risks and turn out to be dead wrong. And I think there is a healthy regard for that, and that has resulted in a set of industry-wide better analytics, better risk-taking profile that I think, by the way, is good for the customer; I think it is good for the agent; and I think it is good for the markets. Wild cyclicality up or down is actually bad for everybody. And better insight, better data, better analytics is actually better for everybody. You get better analysis, you get better, more thoughtful pricing related to risk. So that is a somewhat fulsome answer, but that is how I feel about it.\nJosh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: That\u2019s really helpful, Jay. I guess just one other question. Related to the personal lines business, you guys have made big inroads with Quantum 2, sort of stabilizing your volumes there, getting a more competitive product to market. I am wondering what your plans are for Homeowners. It\u2019s been \u2013 a decade ago probably wasn\u2019t a very good business, but it sure seems like a very profitable one now. But it has been shrinking for many years. I am wondering what \u2013 when maybe we see you guys turn the corner there and start to use it as a growth engine. Thank you.\nJay Fishman: I\u2019m going to ask Doreen to answer. But just because I am allowed to be so proud of what the organization has done. So as far back as we see the data having, I will say, integrity, and that is at least 10 years and maybe more on a comparable basis, we have had 1 year in our Homeowners business with a combined ratio over 100 and that was 2011. That was the Joplin storms and the Tuscaloosa storms. So whether it was Ike, Gustav, and Dolly or Rita, Katrina, Wilma, it didn\u2019t matter. The way that business \u2013 actually I will come back to my previous comment about risk-taking. I am just so proud, candidly, of the way that whole organization has operated and thought about risk-taking. So we love the business, and it has been a terrific performer for us. And actually I personally think in the future as the potentials shift between Auto and Homeowners, I think it could very well do some shifting over the next 10 years. I love where we are; but with that, Doreen, you can take the rest.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Oh, thank you. And obviously, following on what Jay said, I will tell you that we spent and it goes back to I think one of the earlier questions, just about looking at weather. You probably recall we looked at pricing, we looked at underwriting, we looked at concentration, and we feel really that we are operating now from a position of really great returns. And we see that when we have a competitive Auto product that also helps drive Home, and we are going to look for those opportunities where we can tune the product, so that in those areas that we think it makes sense to grow, that we will. So again, we weren\u2019t planning just, we talked about Auto where we thought we were going to be flat to comparing ourselves fourth quarter to last year. We knew Home was going to lag a little bit behind that. So everything we are looking at with production is really according to what our expectations were. But as Jay said, we really were a property underwriter; we like the product; and we\u2019re going to look for the opportunities going forward.\nJosh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Great, Doreen, Jay. Thank you so much.\nGabriella Nawi: This will conclude our call. As always, I am available in Investor Relations for any follow-up questions. Thank you for joining and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the Second Quarter Results teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 22, 2014. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President and Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our second quarter 2014 results. Hopefully you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Other members of senior management are also available for the question and answer period, including Alan Schnitzer, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Business and International Insurance. Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Personal Insurance and Bond and Financial Products. Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re quite pleased with the strong results we posted this quarter, particularly given the magnitude of our catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses. Operating income was $673 million or $1.93 per share. Operating return on equity was 11.04% and we continue to make great progress on lifting our returns, largely in response to continuing very low interest rates and continuing volatile weather. Who would have thought that we\u2019d be talking about a polar vortex in July and at 2.5% ten year treasury in 2014? As demonstrated on slide four of the webcast, comparing this quarter\u2019s earnings to last year is more than accounted for by the tax and legal settlement gains of $122 million, recognized in last year\u2019s second quarter as well as the difference in catastrophe losses quarter-to-quarter. The short story for each of our business segments is good. In Personal Insurance we are really pleased with the marketplace response and production trends. The manual personal auto program Quantum 2.0. While we need more talent, more time and data, the very early on loss indications are encouraging and consistent with our expectations. Our financial, professional and international insurance segment produced record results, with good results from both the bond and financial products business and the international business. In Business Insurance, we continue to generate strong returns as underlying, underwriting margins on an earned basis, continued to expand and written rate gains in the quarter approximated loss trend. Because there was so much interest in our assessment of the rate environment in Business Insurance, we are going to spend a few minutes on that this morning, before I turn it over to Jay. At our recent Investor Day, we were struck by the fact that one analyst asked a question about rate, but started off by saying that he knew we didn\u2019t like talking about aggregate rate indicators. That\u2019s just not so, but the critical caveats in discussing the headline rate, are that first we do not manage rate in the aggregate. We manage it account-by-account or class-by-class, and the actions that we take ultimately add up to a single number. This granularity is evidenced on slide 15 of the webcast, which we\u2019ve shared with you before. The slide is the distribution by rate gain of our commercial accounts business for the second quarter of 2014. And Brian will talk more about this analysis later. Second, we believe that there can be an incorrect assessment of the competitive environment, based upon the direction of the headline number. Let me say again what I\u2019ve said many times before, we are a return driven organization. We have talked with you before and have shared with you data, which demonstrates that the success we are having in improving returns, is based upon achieving rate gains on our poor performing business and maximizing retention on our best performing business. And we\u2019ve also said before, if we are successful, the headline rate gain will inevitably decline over time. There is a conventional reaction amongst many industry observers that this decline reflects as many we put it, a more competitive environment. We just don\u2019t see it that way, given our ability to continue to achieve strong levels of retention at increasing returns approaching our targets. If we have an account where we\u2019ve been successful at increasing returns over time and that account has now reached an appropriate level of profitability, it would be unwise of us to attempt to continue to increase rate significantly on that account and risk the relationship with the agent and customer. Consequently, we just caution everyone from reacting to the decline in the headline number as an indication that the environment generally has become meaningfully and broadly more competitive. At least for us the environment has become more rate adequate and we are executing account-by-account and class-by-class. So now after three plus years of actions resulting in improved returns and profitability the question is where from here. We\u2019ve been reluctant to use the phrase soft landing because we believe that the phrase is often mischaracterized to mean that somehow we have finished attempting to improve the performance of our portfolio. Nothing can be further from the truth, we remain concerned that weather volatility remains problematic and we are not convinced that each of our catastrophe exposed property accounts is priced to reflect that volatility. In addition not every line or every class of business is performing at the same level. For example we are not satisfied with the returns on our commercial auto book particularly in select and we will continue to analyze that portfolio and take the actions necessary to improve it. So we have more work to do, but there are lots of accounts that after years of successful rate and underwriting actions are now at return levels that are consistent with our return threshold and our expression of the soft landing relates to that portion of the book what we have achieved so much. We don\u2019t see anything in the marketplace that suggests that we are at a precipice whether the increased churning of accounts were significant across the board, the rate of declines are imminent. Of course we could be wrong about this, we know we operate in a fragmented marketplace with lots of competition. But we can only share with you our strategy. From our view it is more or the same and as we share with you at Investor Day we are going to relentlessly leverage competitive advantages. It should allow us to out select and out price our competition. We expect to produce earnings and capital substantially in excess of what we need to support our business and we will continue to return that excess capital to shareholders. In short, nothing new and no shift, we feel very well positioned to continue our mission to creating superior shareholder value. And with that let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jay. Let me start by saying that we are very pleased with our results this quarter particularly taking weather into account. Our investment results continue to be very solid driven by private equity returns as were our underlined underwriting results. Within underwriting earned rate increases continue to exceed loss cost trends in each of our business segments. Al though the benefit to earnings into loss ratio was partially offset by higher non-CAT weather related losses this quarter versus the prior year quarter. Underwriting also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $183 million pre-tax down slightly from the prior year quarter and was negatively impacted by CAT losses of $436 million pre-tax up $96 million from the prior year quarter. We provided two analyses in the webcast this quarter to help you better understand the relationship of operating income to both the prior year quarter and to analyst estimates. Jay already discussed the first analysis shown on page four of the webcast which provides insight as to why operating income decreased from the prior year quarter. The second analysis shown on page five of the webcast provides insight as to why operating income was less than the consensus estimate. The CAT loss estimates contained within the consensus estimates where significantly lower than our actual CAT losses. We hope this type of analysis is helpful to you. Each of our business segments once again experienced net favorable prior year reserve development and BI net favorable development of $25 million was driven by better than expected loss experience in general liability excess coverages for accident years 2008-2012 resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected. This was partially offset by an $87 million increase to our environment reserves. Net favorable reserve development of a $146 million in FP&II primarily resulted from better than expected results in contract surety within bond and financial products. While in PI net favorable development of $12 million was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in home owners and other were non-CAT weather related losses in the 2013 accident year. Year-to-date on a combined stat basis for all of our US subs only accident year 2004 and prior developed unfavorably by a very modest amount $73 million due to the strengthening of environmental reserves. All other accident years 2005-2013 developed favorably. We\u2019ve included an overview of CAT reinsurance coverage on page 22 of the webcast which has been structured in a way that is generally consistent with the prior year. Effective July 1, we renewed our Gen CAT treaty keeping both the attachment point and the dollar amount of recovered loss as the same as last year. Recovered losses of up to $400 million within the $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion layer, also effective July 1, we renewed our North East Gen CAT treaty with the same $2.25 billion attachment point as last year with an increased dollar amount of recovered losses up to $850 million this year as compared to $600 million last year. Given the current reinsurance marketplace both renewals were accomplished at lower rates online and with improved terms and conditions, including amending the loss accounts definition so that all win losses have a duration of a 168 hours rather than 96 hours. A more complete description of our CAT reinsurance coverage including a description of our two long point PRE-CAT bonds our Gen-CAT aggregate excess of loss treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences, our earthquake coverage and our international coverage is included in our second quarter 10-Q which we filed earlier today as well as in our 10-K. We continue to generate much more capital than is needed to support our businesses allowing us to return $1.065 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $190 million and repurchased $875 million of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase program consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. Operating cash flows remain strong a little over $600 million. And we ended the quarter with over $1.8 million of holding company liquidity. All of our capital ratios exceeded our target levels and we ended the quarter with a debt to a capital ratio of 21.3% well within our target range. Net unrealized investment gains rose to approximately $3.1 billion pre-tax or $2 billion after tax up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively at the beginning of the year due to lower interest rates. And book value per share of $75.32 was 30% higher than a year ago and over a 7% higher than the beginning of the year. One final note as you know we are revising our business segments and related disclosures to reflect the management changes that were announced on June of 10th and became effect on July 1. Accordingly we report third quarter results using the new segment structure. We are currently in the process of restating our 2013 Form 10-K and our second quarter 2014 Form 10-Q and our financial supplements for the periods contained therein to reflect the new segment structure. And we expect to make these restated documents available to you in early September. So with that let me turn things over to Brain.\nBrian McLean: Thanks Jay, in business insurance second quarter operating income was $409 million and the combined ratio was 99%. The underlying combined ratio which excludes the impact of CAT\u2019s and prior year reserve development was 92.1% for the quarter, an improvement of a 4 percentage point year-over-year. And 90.1% for the first half of 2014, an improvement of 2.5 points over the first half of 2013, the point of improvement in the quarter was driven by about 2 points of earned rate in excess of loss trends partially offset by about a point of non-CAT weather losses. So despite the significant impact of weather solid profitability in the quarter. Turning to production trends beginning on page 11, retention of 81% was strong and slightly higher than recent periods. New business volume of $486 million was 8% was higher quarter-over-quarter while renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent periods at about 6%. The 6% included pure rate increases of about 4% which was about a point lower than the last quarter. As has been the case for last 13 quarters all major lines of business had positive rate change with the largest change this quarter coming in commercial auto. Not surprisingly auto was the line of business with the lowest return and accordingly the greatest rate need. Loss trend for the segment continued to run at about 4% so on an aggregate written basis, rate gains approximated our current view of loss trends. We believe the production results both in the aggregate and by line of business are appropriate given our view of product returns. But as Jay mentioned in his comments we don\u2019t manage the business in an aggregate or total line level. We execute it account-by-account or class-by-class and this is demonstrated on slide 15 which displays the distribution of renewal rate changes for commercial accounts in the second quarter. As you can see from the slide most accounts received a single digit rate increase. But there were numerous accounts that got a rate increase greater than 10% or got some level of rate decrease. There were also some general trends in the portfolio, recently larger accounts have lower average rate changes. And has been the case for several quarters commercial auto accounts have higher average rate changes and there\u2019s always individual account loss experience matters. But the real take away from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions. And accordingly success in this business is not about achieving a higher aggregate rate number, it\u2019s about doing the right things for the right account and generating an appropriate return over time. So in this context our fundamental approach is unchanged and the results continue to be encouraging. Simply put, we are retaining a very high percentage of our best performing accounts at relatively modest rate increases. While on our poor performing business, we continue to get rate increases significantly above loss trend, with lower retentions. We are comfortable moving away from business where returns remain well below target levels and as always we actively look for new business opportunities with appropriate returns. We continue to be very comfortable with how our organization is executing at the granular level and accordingly feel very good about the results. In the financial, professional and international segment we had record operating income of $254 million, which was 65% higher than the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development, improved underlined, underwriting margins, lower catastrophe losses and the inclusion of the Dominion. The underlined combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 89 two, a slight improvement from the prior year. The improvement was due to the 2014 exit from a management liability excessive loss reinsurance treaty, along with earned rate increases in excess of loss cost trend across the segment largely offset by the impact of the Dominion. Net written premium was up 38% in the quarter compared to the prior year, due to the inclusion of Dominion. In the management liability business within bond of financial products, retention of 84% and new business of $37 million were both consistent with recent periods in prior year, while renewal premium changed of about 4% was down somewhat from recent periods. In the international, retention remains strong at 80% while renewal premium change improved to 3% and new business was up year-over-year due to the impact of Dominion, so overall a great quarter for the segment. In our personal insurance business, operating income of $75 million for the quarter was down 47% compared to the second quarter of 2013, driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and home owners, along with higher levels of catastrophe related losses in both auto and home. The underlined combined ratio for the quarter was 89.8 a slight improvement over the second quarter of 2013 with lower underwriting expenses and rate increases in excess of loss trends, largely offset by higher non-cap weather related losses. Looking specifically at auto on the production side, retention remains strong at 82%, renewal premium change was about 6%, while new business volume of 139 million was once again up significantly versus recent periods due to the rollout of Quantum Auto 2.0. We continue to be very pleased with the early results for Quantum Auto 2.0, the product is now live in 31 states and those states represent about 85% of our countrywide auto new business production. In the states where we\u2019ve launched the product, we\u2019ve seen quoted policies increase more than 10%, while the number of policies issued has more than doubled from pre-launch levels. In addition, we continue to make progress on the expense initiatives announced a year-ago that are fundamental to our ability to make our auto product more price competitive. To date we\u2019ve executed on initiatives responsible for about 75% of the $140 million run rate savings target and we remain on track to achieve the full run rate sales by the end of the year in line with our original expectations. Turning to auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 96.2 for the quarter, was a slight improvement compared to the second quarter of 2013 with earned rate increases more than offsetting loss trend, and the impact of higher mix of new business versus renewal business volumes. Our current view of auto loss cost trend remains at about 4% with no significant change in the underlying texture from previous quarters. Looking at homeowners, production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of about 8% while retention remained at 84%, new business volume of $85 million was up from the prior year quarter and recent periods due in part to account rounding on our auto new business. From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 81.5 was in line with the second quarter of 2013, with earned rate increases in excess of loss trend and lower expenses, offset by non-CAT weather-related losses. So overall in personal insurance, we saw strong profitability and an improving production picture. With that let me turn it back over to Gabi.\nGabriella Nawi: I\u2019m sorry there is an addition from Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Yes thanks Gabi, before we open for questions I did want to mention one additional item. We\u2019d be remiss if we did not say how pleased we were to have been recognized as a A++ company by AMBEST [ph] this past May so we just thought we\u2019d end with that and we\u2019d be happy to take your questions now.\nGabriella Nawi: Kelly we are ready for the question and answer portion. May I ask that you all limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please? Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: Yes, thanks couple of quick questions here for you. First of all Jay, just curious, if I look at the business insurance, and you kind of strip out the reserve releases and you can normalize for CAT losses. I kind of come up with about a 12% underlying return equity for the business, I guess my first question is that right, and is that about where you\u2019re kind of targeting given the current interest rate environment?\nBrian McLean: I\u2019ll answer the second part of it; I\u2019ll let Jay Benet \u2013 if he does the math in his head. We\u2019ve been saying for some time that our stated target of achieving the mid-teens return on equity overtime was simply really not achievable in this interest rate environment, but we were willing to keep it as a statement, an aspiration goal but also because so much, so many of our systems and our culture are geared around it. Having said that, we\u2019ve chosen to avoid the notion of an artificial ceiling on what rate adequacy or return adequacy is on an individual line or an individual business. Some of that is driven by competitive dynamics, what is the rest of the marketplace doing, some of it is based upon capacity. So I \u2013 it feels obviously at 2.5% tenure treasury, a 12% number feels pretty good, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to not pick the actions on an account-by-account or class-by-class basis, that would continue to lift it if it\u2019s possible. So that\u2019s really our honest assessment of it, it feels pretty good to us, but maybe there\u2019s more and we\u2019re certainly going to try, but that again is a specific comment more than it is an aggregate rate number. It\u2019s so important that we always keep that in mind, we price individual accounts, we don\u2019t price the portfolio.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: But if you\u2019re pricing right now in line with trend, isn\u2019t that kind of mean you\u2019re assuming that return to adequate?\nJay Fishman: I\u2019m sorry Brian try me again.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: You said you\u2019re pricing, you\u2019re pricing your business insurance in line with loss trend right?\nJay Fishman: Oh no, no what Brian said was that our best accounts are getting modest loss trend. I believe I\u2019m trying to go back to his comments and that our poorer performing accounts, whatever that means in that framework if the three years of rate increases, but there are always poorer performing accounts, if the poor performing accounts are getting significantly more rate increase at lower retention.\nJay Benet: So another way to say that Brian is this quarter, the way the arithmetic worked out, is rate that we got on the entire portfolio approximated the aggregate loss trend, but that could be very different and we could be thrilled with the result or unhappy with the result either direction depending on how we get there.\nJay Fishman: And I think the other part of that, that really is important, is that we wouldn\u2019t contemplate that we can improve our profitability by getting meaningful rate increase on our best performing business. Our focus there is to do our best to offset trend and to maximize retention. Our improvement in profitability is going to come from identifying those segments that under perform. And continuing to make real progress there, I recall in the last quarter, we actually put up a slide which showed the rate gain in our fifth bucket in commercial accounts I think. I can\u2019t remember whether it was commercial or middle market, but compared to the number of accounts in the rate gain to the previous year\u2019s quarter, and the rate gain in that fifth bucket, was 21% I think last year and 20% this year was the rate gain. That\u2019s where the improvement and profitability is going to come from, not just from that shift class, but that\u2019s the example here. It\u2019s going to be identifying those segments that continue to underperform and continuing to drive one.\nBrian Meredith \u2013 UBS: Great, thanks.\nJay Fishman: The other thing I would add before I\u2019ll address your first question is that we have this internal discussion about margin improvement. And you have to look at it in terms of what you\u2019re talking about. Are you talking about combined ratio or you are talking about dollars. And when you talk about combined ratio, now if you do the arithmetic, if you\u2019re covering loss trend let\u2019s make up some numbers, let\u2019s say you have a 60% loss ratio, obviously premiums were at the 100%. If you\u2019re covering loss trend that\u2019s 4% with rate increases, you\u2019re multiplying the denominator and the numerator by the same number. And you come up with the same combined ratio at the end of it 60%, loss ratio, 60% in this case, which you lose track of in that of the dollars because you\u2019re applying a 4% increase to a 100 and another 4% increase to 60% of that. So you\u2019re actually increasing the dollars of margin and increasing profitability, therefore, even when you\u2019re loss trend. So I just say that for all of you to keep in my mind that you\u2019ve got to look at it as to what question you\u2019re really asking. Is combined ratio changing or dollars of margin changing. Getting back to the first question about the overall returns, we do an analysis of our quarters, our year-to-dates. And if I look at the year-to-date operating return on equity, which was 14.6%, there is prior year development in there. Prior year development to our accounts, because a lot of it relates to recent periods where we\u2019ve seen trends different than what we expected and they\u2019ve been favorable. So in any given period, you can adjust for, but if you look at the 14.6% and back out the amount of PYD and divide by the average equity, you\u2019ll come up with something that looks like a proxy for an accident year, this year. So that\u2019s a way of looking at it, but as Jay said, we look at these returns over time, and we try to manage as close as we can to that mid-teen\u2019s goal.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Hi, good morning. I was hoping you could maybe review the topical issue the connections between the insurance market and primary market, particularly in the large account basis and just giving the fact that we\u2019ve seen a lot of rate decline and of reinsurance and how should we think about that affecting your businesses as the competitive environment changes a bit?\nJay Fishman: Hi Paul, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. We think a lot of pitching a little on that, first I just observed that broadly speaking, we are really not a large account writer. I suspect in the context of the question that you\u2019re asking, we are a small commercial and middle market account company. We do large accounts on a fee for service basis that are largely independent of the reinsurance decisions. And we obviously do some national property business; we certainly do that for large accounts. Anecdotally, although some evidence I think exists, the layered national property business, and my recollection, we did this last quarter. I think it\u2019s less than 5% of our premium business overall but the layered large account property business is a much more a price sensitive price driven marketplace, more challenging than it was before. Now there are returns in that segment that are awfully attractive, and so you\u2019ve got to balance up the notion of competitive dynamics within the overall returns. But nonetheless, I think you\u2019re seeing, we think you\u2019re seeing some of the changes in the new capital formation. Whether it\u2019s reinsurance by the way, or excess in surplus, bumping into that layered national property account business. And I would say on a primary side, for us, that\u2019s probably where the impact is most significant. I\u2019m trying to see if anybody else here has a different view? We\u2019re really not \u2013 our treaty reinsurance is, for a company of our size, relatively modest. And so we\u2019ve got either savings opportunities, they\u2019re nice but they\u2019re not going to move the needle very much, or we can change the way in which we purchase. We can but more for the same dollars or less for even fewer dollars, but on the margin, it doesn\u2019t change anything. I\u2019ve been asked a few times whether in this, is an opportunity for us, and I suspect that what people are thinking is, does the calculus behind primary exposure change? Would you be willing to do either different classes of business or more business, particularly in catastrophe exposed areas and rely more on reinsurance to produce an acceptable return. So far the answer for us is no, that we worry a lot about the mismatch of business, we worry a lot about relying on reinsurance as a strategic solution rather than as a risk balancing factor, if you like. And the notion of expanding our liability base and relying on a reinsurance contract to bail us out. We were not quite sure of that reinsurance capacity really sticks, is it permanent, is it really there for the long haul? It\u2019s just not clear to us yet. So for us, the answer is that the impact of all of this is not yet very much. We spend, not an insignificant amount, talking about it and thinking about ways in which it could impact us, but so far, I think you\u2019re hard pressed other than that layered national property business to find an area where it\u2019s really having an impact.\nPaul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Maybe another fundamental question here, you\u2019d obviously talked a lot about how focusing on that renewal rate number and commercial insurance is not necessarily the best measure of what your assessment of the competitive environment. What\u2019s the alternative for us to look at and also illustrate?\nJay Fishman: That\u2019s actually a great question and I think you asked it actually in exactly the right way. It\u2019s not that the number doesn\u2019t have arithmetic meaning, we acknowledge it does, but the tendency to perceive it as a competitive indicator, we just don\u2019t see that. We\u2019ve always said, and have for many years, that retention is going to be the leading indicator of a changing competitive environment. And I\u2019ll go back to the last really difficult pricing environment that we had, which was back into the \u201890s, you\u2019ll see retention rates in middle market drop down into the high 60s. And that really defined what was going on, there was tremendous churn in the marketplace. It didn\u2019t happen overnight, but retention rates declined and that followed, that led, if you will, the overall rate dynamic. Now we haven\u2019t seen that yet, we haven\u2019t seen it on the way up, we haven\u2019t seen it \u2013 we\u2019re still on the way up, although we\u2019re at slower rates. We just haven\u2019t seen a drop in retention, and we said for a long time, that we think that\u2019s the principle indicator. Now we also, to provide whatever anecdotal observation we can, we often have provided you with commentary about what we\u2019re hearing from the field. They had to take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right, but there are observations from people in the field dealing with individual accounts every day. And our comments remain, that there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re hearing from our folks that would cause us to think that we\u2019re at a precipice or broadly a more meaningfully competitive environment, but I watch retention. And that\u2019s what I look at, and when I see a drop in that, that\u2019s when it\u2019s time to begin to understand what\u2019s going on in that local environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my call, my question is regarding to the segmentation changes and management change recently. Could you comment a little bit more on that?\nBrian McLean: We have much more to say, we put out a press release its part of management\u2019s responsibility, our responsibility here is to make sure that the younger talent in the organization gets additional exposure internally, exposure externally and position the company for continuity and just felt to us like a very ordinary and inappropriate thing to do. The real alignment was to a great extent, driven by reporting relationships within those changes, so much more about the people than about any particular realignment about the business.\nKai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley: Great just follow-on that and Jay has done a wonderful job for the company and the shareholders and is this the recent management change is part of evolution about how the boards think about the succession plan?\nJay Fishman: Well I would never speak for the board and so \u2013 we think we have a responsibility to develop talent and present to the board as solid a management team as we\u2019re capable of doing. And we\u2019re going to be a management team that\u2019s going to step up to that responsibility and not side step it. The depth of the folks in this place around here it never fails to amaze me. The talent here is just remarkable. And my job particularly, is to make sure that those people get additional responsibility and additional exposure. And that when that time comes that it\u2019s very natural, there\u2019s nothing upsetting to the organization internally. There\u2019s nothing upsetting to the constituents externally, it\u2019s as it should be and that\u2019s really my goal. For I mean \u2013 I\u2019ll be 62 in November Brian I think is going to be 62 later this year. I think Jay Benet will be 62 in August, so we all \u2013 we\u2019re not Methuselah here, we\u2019re mere mortals and our time will come. And our job is to develop that next generation and present them and just have it not be a big deal.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie; please proceed with your question.\nAmit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Thanks, and I\u2019m not 62 yet so. Just two quick follow-up questions. The first is, I guess it was Brian\u2019s question and you answered that. Jay you said retentions, you haven\u2019t seen it on its way up. And I\u2019m trying to sort of think about those and you\u2019re right, we should focus on retentions and rate adequacy if so many lines are at rate adequacy shouldn\u2019t that eventually start class stating [ph] into better retentions and eventual growth in premiums?\nJay Fishman: Complicated question. I think that retention, something [indiscernible] taught me many years ago, that the real emotional content behind retention is agent comfortable, market comfortable, customer comfortable, a terrific set of circumstances where everybody feels good and fair and equitable in the relationship. And that will encourage accounts to stay where they are. And that\u2019s a really good thing, it\u2019s good for the accounts by the way. We think tenure matters; we think it\u2019s a advantage, it\u2019s good for the agents. They can attend to things that they need to attend to and obviously it\u2019s good for the carriers that have the business. So the retention dynamic is, I think, really a reflection of the level of comfort of all of the parties to the transaction. And that\u2019s really good, that\u2019s a good thing. Dynamic of growth is a more challenging one. There\u2019s no green light that goes on that says, now we\u2019re interested in growing. Always interested in doing more business, always and when we can bring on new accounts and we have \u2013 we\u2019ve demonstrated this in slides in years gone by. Recognizing that there is a, the internal expression is a new business penalty, but recognizing that there\u2019s a new business penalty associated with it, if we can see a pathway to bringing on new accounts, and over time managing them to acceptable returns, we\u2019re going to go ahead and do that, there\u2019s nothing different about that this month than there was last month. And it\u2019s not as if we weren\u2019t booking new business a year-ago when rates weren\u2019t as attractive as they are now. We were, we were as aggressive as we could be. And if anything, I would say that \u2013 if we had any disappoint, is that we weren\u2019t actually doing more notwithstanding our encouragement. The thing to recognize is that, and again I\u2019ve said this before, I apologize for saying that so many times I don\u2019t want it to sound it as though we believe this because of this quarter and this is what we\u2019ve said. You\u2019re not going to grow your book by marginally changing your price attitude at the point of sale. First of all we don\u2019t have a price list. We don\u2019t have a price list; it\u2019s an individual underwriter sitting down with an agent talking about an individual account. So it\u2019s not as if we can say lower prices by 3% or 4%, it just isn\u2019t that precise. And so the way you, the way you grow is by perceiving opportunity, typically by risk selection, either categories of risk, lines of business geographies that you weren\u2019t in before that amount for any number of reasons, you perceive opportunity for us Canada, terrific opportunity, Brazil a terrific opportunity. We showed at Investor Day we\u2019ve grown our middle markets business. My recollection is like by 50% over eight or nine years from $2.1 billion to $3.2 billion in premiums. Now at the same time our construction surety business has shrunk pretty dramatically as a result of the environment we\u2019re in. And so you have to be \u2013 we\u2019re not in one market, we\u2019re 50 markets. And you have to be nimble enough to see the opportunities where they are and pursue them aggressively, but also be cautious enough to understand the risk presented in a changing set of circumstances and dial it back. So we\u2019ve been growing in the lines of business here significantly, and either because circumstances change or we made mistakes in some markets than we did, we, we shrunk others, so it\u2019s all in net but it is in that granular dynamic.\nAmit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: My apologies for the fire alarm, just very quickly is there a portion of your book which can be potentially structured into a sidecar or an alternative capital provider, thanks. Jay Fishman \u2013 I\u2019m reluctant to give a quick answer on something that, we haven\u2019t really thought about it, we haven\u2019t spent time contemplating it. I actually thought where you were heading was a portfolio transfer transaction, which we always think about, but I haven\u2019t thought about the sidecar dynamic and I\u2019d be reluctant to answer on the slide.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Thank you. I had a question about Dominion actually, if I remember right, that was a business where you guys bought it was operating around a 100 combined, and it looks like you\u2019ve really turned that around very quickly,, just curious kind of where\u2019s that business running now. And maybe you can just talk a little bit about what actions you\u2019ve taken in order to kind of to get yourself to that place, thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure Michael its Alan Schnitzer I\u2019ll handle that. I guess I would say, I would caution you from thinking that we\u2019ve turned it around that quickly there\u2019s certainly a lot integration work going on and we\u2019re still; we\u2019re still hard at work on that. So the improvement you\u2019re seeing I guess is your, you\u2019re looking at the results and seeing the combined ratio relative to what we guided you to and treating that to Dominion, that\u2019s actually not correct its mostly a reinsurance transaction and some large losses that were better than what we had in the \u201892. So it\u2019s actually not coming from the Dominion, but to get to your, to get to your question what are we doing? We\u2019re doing all the sorts of things you\u2019d think that, that a company like us would be doing. We\u2019re working hard with Greg Toczydlowski in personal insurance and the whole business insurance team to bring all the know-how and sophistication in data and analytics, some scale and synergy advantage, but really just taking the know-how we have resident here at Travelers\u2019 and exporting it to that platform. And we feel very good about the opportunity, as good as we did when we signed up the deal, but I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s all been reflected in this quarter.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: So then so the expense ratio benefit that we saw is primarily a result of the reinsurance, can you mention them?\nAlan Schnitzer: No, no the expense benefit you saw does primarily come from the Dominion, but there is, there is a more than offsetting loss ratio deterioration from the Dominion. So on a net basis and an all win basis, loss and expense ratio, the Dominion is actually hurting, but it is helping on the expense ratio pretty significantly. And it\u2019s a loss ratio piece we think over that time, we\u2019ll be able to work through and bring to hurtle levels.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: That makes sense.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Thanks very much. First I\u2019ve been covering the company and industry for a long time. I think we all understand the spring storms tend to be a heavy seasonal CAT quarter. I think it will be helpful for folks to get a perspective on what you would normalize annual CAT load to be. If I look back over say the past dozen years, I think the average is between 4 and 5 combined ratio points. Is that a good starting point?\nJay Fishman: And Jay, just for clarification you were talking about in the second quarter.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Correct, I was talking about \u2013 say for the full year I think that gives a better perspective.\nJay Benet: Actually, this is Jay Benet, Jay, actually if you go to the proxy, there\u2019s a discussion about results and in it we do talk about what the expectation was for the CATs in the year versus where we ended up. And my recollection is the numbers about $550 after tax dollars. In dollars yes, so we\u2019re just having somebody open up the proxy and make sure we\u2019re right about that.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Okay thank you, I can generally take a look at that. On the next issue it would be in terms of capital return, I\u2019m wondering if we were to think about out years, could Travelers ultimately be in a position where dividends plus share buy backs could exceed in your operating earnings?\nJay Benet: Not permanently, it can obviously year-to-year. And that\u2019s really a function of timing, but the only way that it could actually exceed earnings permanently would be if we look today at the company. That\u2019s the only way to do it, so you know not permanently, no.\nBrian McLean: Jay let me just jump back, it\u2019s Brian McLean, you started with we all kind of know spring storms and volatility and clearly we do, but when we look at our data of particularly what\u2019s happened with spring weather over the course of the last \u2013 well since 2008, it\u2019s dramatically higher than what you would have seen in the previous 20 years. To the extent of you know a 3X kind of number and in fact that\u2019s not even counting the 2011 off the charts number that we had. So we\u2019ve always known that we would have near term, short term volatility in our CAT numbers and everybody follows the industry, it\u2019s used to looking at that, but particularly for the second quarter tornado, hail activity and how our product is used to deal with that, we really have done a lot of thinking about what\u2019s the long term move to and whether we see continuing volatility in that number?\nJay Fishman: A good example anecdotal actually of the magnitude of the volatility, there was not two on the go, we didn\u2019t think about catastrophe loading auto, in personal auto. We do now and that\u2019s just the function of experience. So we\u2019re reacting to the changing weather patterns kind of almost on a real time basis. It\u2019s hard to answer the question at this point, of what a normal level is, that\u2019s why we talked about it so much over the last few years. There\u2019s been a driver of not only weight, but underwriting in terms of conditions; it\u2019s just proving to be a challenge.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Hi, good Morning. First question on the competitive environment, I think you\u2019ve done a good job explaining that it\u2019s largely unchanged. Jay, you mentioned that you think there is likely going to be a soft landing. Just curious sort of looking at the cycle versus the past, what\u2019s different and what gives you confidence that there is going to be a softer landing this time around?\nJay Fishman: Just because it\u2019s my opinion doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s so; I need to start off with that. It\u2019s just one persons point of view right, we\u2019ve been talking for years now about the fact that our view was that the magnitude of this cyclicality in our business, we thought would be lower than an historical experience. And it was driven by everything from much better data across the industry. I\u2019ll exclude myself, but I think much better management in the industry than wasn\u2019t the case 20 years ago. You look at capital deployment philosophies; it\u2019s different than it was 20 years ago. I think Sarbanes Oxley and the attention of audit committees and boards to adequacy of reserves to the level, the procedures and policies around reserve setting has made them much more accurate. It\u2019s not that people were abusing it before, it\u2019s that there\u2019s a whole different level of attention and focus on those initial picks, what\u2019s driving them, what are the factors for transparency that exists to what the governance committee, external auditors, internal auditors, boards, those are all things that will make the accounting and reserving process better. Never guarantee, we\u2019re all talking about the future but it will make it better and I think it has. And I think as a consequence of that, the feedback move between clean performance and underwriters and pricing decisions is stunningly faster than it was 20 years ago. We actually are at a point now where we\u2019re booking weather dynamics virtually month-to-month. When I first started here, you were lucky if you had it in the quarter, that\u2019s the level of feedback there was. So the delay in understanding what\u2019s trans-factoring it back into reserving and changing pricing, was much more attenuated than it is today, its crisp. And I\u2019ve listened to other companies and how they report, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re unique in that regard, I think \u2013 I listen to other companies and I\u2019m impressed by what I hear and the nature of controls and procedures and the thoughtfulness and I think is a consequence the magnitude \u2013 there\u2019ll always be some cyclicality here and there\u2019s cyclicality in every business. But I said, coming close to probably 8 or 9 years ago, I thought that the amplitude on the way up as well as the amplitude on the way down were going to be much more narrow. I think that was true obviously on the way up we will now see it on the way down. So that\u2019s what I think, and we\u2019ll find out, I think the leadership in this industry has come to understand that attempting to grow market share by marginally changing price, and actually creating share holder value from it is impossible. I think about it all the time, and I don\u2019t know how to do it and I\u2019m not sure anybody else does. And so we\u2019ve all learned within our own cultures and our own environment and our own strategies, how to manage our businesses to create shareholder value, that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do.\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Thank you and just a quick follow-up on the Quantum 2.0, I think you said that the results weren\u2019t what the expectations, just a little bit more color on that. You\u2019ve had 6 months, and so what do you think in terms of loss and what\u2019s your expectations thanks.\nJay Fishman: I\u2019m going to turn it over to Greg in a second to talk about loss trend, but it would be remiss if I didn\u2019t observe, because I think he takes it for granted on this. We mentioned that the number of quoted policies is actually up 10%. That\u2019s one of the really wonderful surprises here, we thought going into this, that we were being quoted everywhere because of the comparative rating process. And it was not our going in expectation that by putting in a different model, that we would actually increase the number of quotes. And so what\u2019s been \u2013 that 10% is a big number and what\u2019s impressive about that, is the agent understanding and reaction of the Travelers product of Quantum 2 as a legitimate competitive product and they\u2019re embracing it in their quoting process. So that\u2019s where we loss trend, but we\u2019ve to some extent, taken for granted internally the increase in quotes but it\u2019s a substantive plus.\nBrian McLean: Absolutely and I think that echoes about how we feel about loss performance, we\u2019re very encouraged when we saw that increase in quote flow that Jay talked about. Obviously our focus then shifts right to the margin about how we\u2019re feeling about the profitability in that business given that we\u2019ve just launched our three largest states last month. We\u2019re not up on our 1 year anniversary, obviously we don\u2019t have a credible set of earned premium yet to really declare a victory, but our focus is really looking at long-term surrogates of profit right now, including the mix of business, short-tail coverage\u2019s like the frequency on physical damage coverage and all of those things that we\u2019re looking at, they\u2019re right within expectation. So we\u2019ll continue to aggressively measure the ultimate combined ratio, but all those proxies that we look at are within expectations. So we\u2019re feeling as good about the quote flow that Jay talked about that we are with the early loss indicators.\nGabriella Nawi: Before we go to the next question, Jay Benet has a correction.\nJay Benet: It\u2019s a comment more than a correction. We said we would give you the number from the proxy as it relates to the quote, unquote normal CAT losses. And what we\u2019re remembering was actually from two years ago, the proxy from 2013 had $645 million as the after tax cost associated with CAT. So we had $550 before, and as I\u2019m reflecting on that, the thing I\u2019d want to share with you is really the fragility of these kinds of estimates, because looking at the $550 going to $650; it\u2019s not a reflection of increased exposure. It\u2019s really a reflection of trying to refine year-over-year what these CAT estimates are. And it\u2019s not all that long ago that if you ask the same question, we would have said something like $350 million after tax. And thinking back to those times, it\u2019s our exposure base was actually quite a lot larger than that. So this notion of \u2013 so while we\u2019re saying this is quote, unquote normal, I just want to highlight the fragility of the estimates.\nGabriella Nawi: Great, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRandy Binner \u2013 FBR: Hi. Thank you. I have a couple on reserves and it\u2019s in the commercial area, you commented that asbestos environment led to kind of 08 to 12 releases. Can we infer just kind of from a normal claim closing pattern on general liability, that anything you\u2019d get 08 and prior in that area is kind of \u2013 you would have seen it by now?\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet, when we\u2019re doing; we\u2019re dealing with reserves, by definition we\u2019re dealing with incomplete information. So we\u2019re looking at new information that\u2019s coming in every quarter and evaluating that with regard to whatever the assumptions have been. So I wouldn\u2019t look at any one of our reserves as being at finality. We\u2019re always looking at the flow of information and adjusting. There are times when you see some things; you\u2019re not sure whether you\u2019re going to react in full or in part to it. So I think it\u2019s the best I can do to answer your question.\nRandy Binner \u2013 FBR: Okay. Yeah I mean I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of \u2013 because there\u2019s some PL and GL but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not as long as like asbestos environmental, so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, if there really even is the potential for a lot more to come from 08 and prior?\nJay Benet: I mean our reserves are always a best estimate, so we don\u2019t really comment on whether they\u2019re going to change, we\u2019ll see what the data says going forward, there\u2019s always new information coming.\nJay Fishman: I\u2019d just make an observation, asbestos and environmental is a general liability exposure. The difference there is that particularly in the asbestos arena, much of it came from a time when there were no policy aggregates, there were per occurrence aggregates that we started on a mid basis. I think we ended up with policy aggregate starting in the early 80s. So that was pre dated that, but liability is a policy that lasts forever, you can always have things \u2013 you just never know.\nGabriella Nawi: Great, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I guess question I had was on loss trend, you talk about a loss trend in business insurance of roughly around 4%. And I\u2019m wondering is that the number you\u2019ve priced for or is that what you are observing, because seemingly what you\u2019ve been pricing before for the past, you know five years. You\u2019ve seen something less than that given the reserve releases. So when you talk about that number what exactly are you referring to?\nBrian McLean: Our actuaries, our finance, our business folks are always looking at what they think frequency and severities going to be and you know, building in you know various assumptions they take into account, what recent trends have been. There\u2019s always the question of gee, if you\u2019d seen \u2013 and make up an example, if you\u2019ve seen recent inflation running at 1% or whatever, what does that mean going forward? Is it going to continue at 1% or is it going to get better, is it going to get worse? So at a very granular level, we\u2019re making assumption everyday and pricing and reserving as to what the future has in store based on current events and past trends. And when you look at the kind of environment that we\u2019re faced with today, looking at very tame inflation, but some of the factors at work as to creating uncertainty as to what those inflation rates are going to be going forward. You have to take that into account and ultimately, that along with every other assumption comes down to a series of numbers for frequency and severity. And things have been running pretty moderately, but when we say there\u2019s a 4% trend factor and you go back in time, I think you\u2019re absolutely right in saying well maybe it was actually a little less severe than we had expected. So we had favorable development, but going forward, you have to make a determination as to whether that\u2019s going to continue or whether the world is going to change.\nJay Fishman: Right so specifically Jay, when we say this quarter 4% loss trend, we\u2019re talking about both what we\u2019re seeing is trend in the current year, and what we\u2019re pricing for. And obviously that\u2019s an aggregate number so it\u2019s all over the place by different lines. As we have prior year development, we\u2019re looking at why we had that development and does that change our outlook of what the current year should be? So an example of one which usually wouldn\u2019t would be if we had favorable development on prior year CAT, we\u2019d probably say that doesn\u2019t \u2013 unless they were dramatic, wouldn\u2019t fundamentally change our view of CAT\u2019s this year. There are other things that you could obviously say would change it. So the base year does move but, its \u2013\nJay Benet: Yeah and the most volatile part of it is non-CAT weather. Our loss trend numbers make an assumption about non-CAT weather and that\u2019s obviously, at least I think, the most unpredictable part of that loss trend dynamic, it is one of the reasons why you\u2019re hearing us relentlessly talk about upset by favorable non-CAT weather or upset by adverse non-CAT weather, it\u2019s just who knows.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: On that topic you talked about non-CAT weather relative to a year-ago being worse. Can you speak to non-CAT weather relative to a normal second quarter, was this worse than you might have expected normally, instead of just compared to last year versus the normal expectation.\nJay Benet: I\u2019ll take that and it\u2019s a little different BI to PI so in, in personal insurance we would say this quarter was the non-CAT weather was about normal. It was a couple of points worse than last year, which was abnormally low. In BI this quarter non-CAT weather was a little bit high, so about a point unfavorable to both last year, which was kind of normal and what we would have expected this year. And the difference there is especially when you get into tornado, hail the, the impacts in the commercial business can be really random and volatile. Personal lines you have a storm and it hits the neighborhood and we can kind of see the claims. In business insurance you can hit our risk or not hit our risk and it could dramatically change the number. So that\u2019s the perspective relative to kind of normal. PI about normal this quarter BI a little bit worse than normal.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. And this will be our last and final question.\nOperator: And the last question comes from Josh Stirling with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: So we talked a lot about reserves. I was wondering if you could give us some color, I know it\u2019s the best estimate, but there\u2019s a range of different approaches across the industry. Some companies consistently target something like a zero favorable development targets on consistently target a much larger number. You guys, just from observation, seem to be sort of in the middle of the range, but everybody is thinking about earnings over the next few years, pricing slowing you think you\u2019re guiding in your \u2013 in your outlooks actually talk about how underwriting margins and the underlying basis seem to be slowing and stabilizing. I\u2019m wondering what we should be expecting you guys truly would like to be sort of a normal level of favorable development, when you think about sort of what\u2019s your real philosophy really. And through the cycle or look like, it\u2019d be really helpful for us?\nBrian McLean: Looking at each other, Jay and I my own view is that our goal is to get it right. If we could pick the right number, and first of all, that\u2019s our responsibility, our obligation is to record a best estimate. So that\u2019s what we do, we attempt to record best estimate. And the accounting rules are critical, they\u2019re a really big deal, but it\u2019s also how you price and how you think about the returns in your business. And where you perceive risk versus rewards. So the importance of making it our best estimate is just critical. We struggle to figure out how to manage the business if we were recording something other than that, because we priced to that loss ratio, we priced to that trend, we priced to that yield curve, it\u2019s just critical for us. So I\u2019m sure Jay and I would say this but \u2013 give you the same answer, which is our expectation sitting here today, is that there won\u2019t be any development. We think we\u2019ve got it right, it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have issues that we\u2019re watching and aware of and you\u2019ll ask us often about emerging trends and claims. We keep track of all that, but our goal is to get it right and so the notion of a question about a normal level of reserved development, just doesn\u2019t resonate with us. We don\u2019t think of it that way, we don\u2019t think there is a normal level of reserve development.\nJay Benet: And I fully agree with that. It\u2019s always about best estimates; it\u2019s always about getting it right. I just echo what Jay says.\nJosh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: That\u2019s fine. And thank you but again, I just asked the question. This quarter seemed to slow a little bit, the competition was \u2013 I think you talked about some good guys and bad guys, I was very, was obviously a good news and then there were some environmental. Is there anything that we can infer from the lower PI favorable development and the lower personal lines favorable development that we should look at as a forward leading indicator or is the process still the same and should we look back over the average and make our own conclusions?\nJay Benet: Well we try to give you as much information as we can with regard to what the drivers of favorable development are. So in the case of PI, do you think about the first quarter, a lot of it dealt with weather related losses both CAT and non-CAT and we had some additional non-CAT weather related losses that turned out to be more favorable. And business insurance, you just mentioned of the level of favorable development was 25, but that was after the environmental. So if you just look at the numbers, you\u2019ve got a storyline that over the last many years has provided insight as to what are the drivers of it and we\u2019ll see just how those drivers, or others, manifest themselves moving forward, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s more that we have to offer that relates to that. We try to be pretty transparent, very transparent.\nGabriella Nawi: Very good, that will conclude our calls today. Thank you very much for joining us and as always, Andrew Hersom and I and in Investor Relations will be available for any follow-up questions. Thank you."}, {"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 1, "year": 2014, "date": "2014-04-22 13:35:05", "content": "Executives: Jay Fishman \u2013 Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Brian McLean \u2013 President, Chief Operating Officer Jay Benet \u2013 Vice Chairman, Chief Financial Officer Alan Schnitzer \u2013 Head of Financial, Professional & International Gabriella Nawi \u2013 Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\nAnalysts: Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs\n : Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital \nOperator:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the first quarter results teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 22, 2014. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our first quarter 2014 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian McLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also available for the question and answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for your questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risk and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. Now, Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased to report an outstanding start to 2014 with net and operating income of over a billion dollars and record net and operating income per diluted share of $2.95. Our operating return on equity of nearly 18% in the quarter is the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009 when we posted just over 18%. These results keep us very much on track to meet our financial objective of achieving a mid-teens return on equity over time, and this is the case even if one were to exclude our favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter given that our accident year operating return on equity was 14.7%. In the fourth quarter of last year, I shared with you that we believe we were firing on all cylinders, and that continues today. We had terrific first quarter results in business insurance where profitability improved once again. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our efforts to improve returns through the continued execution of our granular pricing strategy. Given our segmentation approach of seeking appropriate returns on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis, we have shared with you that the headline aggregate rate gain which is the result of our active pricing strategy will come down as we continue to execute this strategy. Some industry observers perceive this as an indication of increasing price competitiveness. We reject that notion because we are managing our pricing actions very thoughtfully and in that regard for our individually underwritten accounts we have the ability to consider each individual account\u2019s contribution before engaging in renewal negotiations. This is where analytical competitive advantage based on data really matters.  Our strategy is very much proactive and much less reactive than it seems many industry observers believe. That said, our assessment of the competitive environment as it relates to rate is that it is for the most part unchanged. This is supported by the fact that we continued to achieve historically high levels of account retention. Another point of support is the data we are providing on Slide 4 of the webcast which for our middle market business compares the renewal rate gain and number of accounts in the poorest performing segment of this business in the first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2013. You can see that the renewal rate gain was virtually the same in these quarters but that the number of accounts qualifying as poorest performing and renewed in the quarter declined from 289 to 216. As our overall portfolio improves and the number of accounts in our poorest performance band has declined, the change in the aggregate headline rate gain to the extent that this band contributes to that headline number reflects the decline in accounts in this band rather than a change in the competitive environment within the band. In summary, given that our goal is to achieve improved returns consistent with our financial objectives, there\u2019s nothing that we see happening in the competitive environment today that causes us to be less optimistic about our ability to achieve our goal.  In financial, professional and international insurance, we achieved 20% growth in operating income and a 47% increase in net written premiums, both from the impact of the Dominion acquisition and strong performance in our management liability and surety businesses. Our integration efforts in Canada are very much on track and we are really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made. Turning to personal insurance, in homeowners we produced a combined ratio of 72.4% or 86.5% excluding favorable prior year development, even considering the meaningful winter weather we experienced in the quarter. This performance, taken in the context of our results over the last decade, continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. In personal auto, we experienced 1.1 points of improvement in the underlying combined ratio. More importantly, we are very excited about the deployment of our new personal auto product, Quantum Auto 2.0. We\u2019ve now rolled the product out in 28 states and the District of Columbia. It was our expectation that this product would dramatically improve our comparative rate or quoting position, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing so far. While we\u2019ve achieved this improvement largely through reductions in price, it is critical to note that this lower price structure is based upon the expense actions we have committed to and meaningfully achieved, as well as a lower commission for Quantum Auto 2.0. Consequently, once fully rolled out, we believe the product is priced to produce returns that are consistent with our long-term goal. While we are reasonably confident in our estimates of loss content, particularly because the product was built largely on the foundation of Quantum Auto 1.0, it will take a few more quarters for us to know more. We will continue to roll this product out across the country and we are pleased that we now have a product that can successfully compete in this rapidly changing marketplace. Brian will speak more about Quantum 2.0, and we look forward to talking to you more about our strategy in personal insurance during our investor day on June 6. Finally, this morning we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend per share of 10% to $0.55 per share, which is the tenth consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our quarterly dividend. We note that the compound annual growth rate for our dividend over that time is 9.6%. With that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jay. By any measure, our first quarter results \u2013 record net and operating income per diluted share of $2.95, operating ROE of 17.8%, and a GAAP combined ratio of 85.7% - were exceptional. As was the case in recent quarters, these strong results were built upon very solid investment results primarily driven by private equity and real estate returns along with very strong underwriting performance. Within underwriting, earned rate increases continued to exceed loss cost trends in each of our business segments, although this benefit to our loss ratio was mostly offset by the severe CAT and non-CAT winter weather that gripped the country this quarter. Our loss ratio also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $294 million pre-tax, which was up $63 million from the prior year quarter, and was adversely impacted by catastrophe losses of $149 million pre-tax which were up $50 million.  In addition, our expense ratio benefited from a $76 million pre-tax reduction in an estimated liability for state assessment that we were required to pay in relation to our workers\u2019 compensation premiums. This reduction in our estimated liability resulted from a change in state law that took effect in the first quarter of 2014 that clarified our payment obligations. Each of our business segments once again produced net favorable prior year reserve development. In BI, net favorable development of $93 million was driven by better than expected loss experience for general liability excess coverages that resulted from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected, as well as favorable CAT and non-CAT property loss development partially offset by higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages within CMP. Net favorable development of $69 million in FP&II primarily resulted from better than expected results in contact surety and bond and financial products, while in PI net favorable reserve development of $132 million was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in homeowners and other for CAT and non-CAT weather-related losses. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 accident year 2004 and prior developed unfavorably by a de minimis amount, approximately $11 million, while each accident year in the period 2005 through 2013 developed favorably in this quarter.  Operating cash flows were very strong, a little over $700 million, and up from $530 million in the prior year quarter. We ended the quarter with over $1.6 billion of holding company liquidity and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.6 billion pre-tax or $1.7 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively at the beginning of the year mostly due to reductions in spreads. Book value per share was $73.06 or 7% higher than a year ago and 4% higher than at the beginning of this year. Turning to capital management, we continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $882 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $177 million and repurchased $705 million of our common shares, including $650 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $55 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. Finally, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.55, a 10% increase on top of last year\u2019s 9% increase. So with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian McLean: Thanks Jay. In business insurance, we had a very strong quarter with operating income of $653 million and a combined ratio of 87.7. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of CATs in prior year development, was 88.1 for the quarter, an improvement of four points year-over-year. As always, there were some moving pieces in the combined ratio this quarter, including a favorable non-recurring expense item and unfavorable non-CAT weather losses. Excluding these items, margin expansion driven by the impact of earned rate in excess of loss trends was about two points. Turning to production trends, beginning on Page 10, retention was up in the quarter to 81% while renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent periods at about 7%. The 7% included pure rate increases of about 5%, down about a point from last quarter. The rate increases continued to be broad-based and were led by commercial auto. New business volume in the quarter of $443 million was similar to recent periods. Loss trend continued to run at about 4% for the segment, so on a written basis rate gains continued to be above our current view of loss trend. The production results for the quarter within the segment tell somewhat different stories this quarter, so I\u2019d like to spend a moment discussing each of them individually. Beginning on Page 11 with select accounts, our small commercial business, the production metrics reflect the impact of our active strategy to improve the profitability on portions of this business. For some time, we have been taking the necessary actions to improve our returns, and those actions have been successful; consequently, we are shifting focus and rate expectations to retaining more of our business and are pleased with the four point improvement in retention this quarter. We also feel very good about the 9.2% renewal premium change we achieved for the quarter. Turning to commercial accounts on Slide 12, both the aggregate rate and retention were unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2013, but as we\u2019ve commented before, it\u2019s not the aggregate number that we focus on. As we have successfully executed our strategy of improving the returns of this business over time, the headline aggregate rate increase number has moderated while retention has improved. We continue to execute a very granular strategy to retain our best performing accounts and to get significant rate increases on our poor performing business. As we enter the fourth year of implementing this strategy, our ability to execute is largely unchanged. So in summary, we continue to see a pretty stable commercial accounts market with rate and retention dynamics consistent with improving product margins. Looking at other business insurance on Slide 13, the environment is largely the same as for commercial accounts with the exception of the larger end of our national property business, specifically large layered property risks where we have seen rate pressure intensify. For perspective, our entire national property book represents about 5% of our total business insurance net written premiums, and the large layered programs are a subset of this.  In the financial, professional and international segment, operating income of $195 million was very strong and up 20% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by the inclusion of the Dominion, higher levels of underlying underwriting margins, and our decision to exit a management liability excess of loss reinsurance treaty in 2014. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 90%, a slight improvement from the prior year. The improvement was due to earned rate in excess of loss trend across the segment along with the exit from the management liability reinsurance treaty I just mentioned, largely offset by the impact of the Dominion.  The Dominion had a negative impact of 2.2 points on the segment underlying combined ratio. This is the first quarter that reflects the full impact of the Dominion acquisition and I\u2019m pleased to say that the integration is proceeding in line with our expectations. Of course, we expect that the Dominion results will improve over time; however, given its relative size, we don\u2019t intend to spike it out going forward. Turning to production results, surety gross written premium of $216 million was up from $195 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting gains in contract surety. In management liability, retention and renewal premium change remain strong at 85% and 8% respectively while new business was down a little bit from recent periods. In international, retention continued to improve and came in at 83% for the quarter, renewal premium change rose to nearly 3%, and new business was up significantly year-over-year due to the impact of Dominion. So overall, a great quarter for the segment. In our personal insurance business, operating income of $268 million for the quarter was up 36% versus the first quarter of 2013, driven by higher net favorable reserve development in homeowners along with improved underlying underwriting results in both auto and home. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 87.4, and improvement of about two points versus the first quarter of 2013 due to lower expenses, along with rate increases in excess of loss trend, partially offset by higher non-CAT weather-related losses.  Looking specifically at auto production, retention remains strong at 81%, renewal premium change was about 6%, while new business volume was up significantly versus recent periods due to the rollout of our new product, Quantum Auto 2.0. Jay spoke about how pleased we are with the early production results for Quantum 2.0, and I\u2019d like to take a moment to give you some additional color on our progress on the expense initiatives that are fundamental to our ability to make our auto product more price competitive. As you recall, in addition to a two-point commission reduction for the new product, we\u2019re taking actions on our operating expenses which will result in savings of about $140 million pre-tax. To date, we\u2019ve executed on initiatives responsible for about two-thirds of the $140 million run rate savings and we remain on target to achieve the full run rate saves by the end of this year, in line with our original expectations. As we mentioned last year, the operating expense reductions are primarily intended to benefit auto but will also benefit the homeowners results. In terms of impact on the combined ratio, the benefit from the operating expense reductions will be split roughly equally between the loss ratio due to claim expense reductions and the expense ratio due to other insurance expense reductions. We believe that the initial success of Quantum 2.0 is due not only to the delivery of a product with competitive price and a structure that better responds to consumer buying preferences, but also to the strength of our long-term relationships to the independent agent channel and the fact that we are a recognized brand in the marketplace. Turning to auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio was 92.3 for the quarter, an improvement of over a point versus the first quarter of 2013, and was driven by earned rate increases in excess of loss trend. Our current view of auto loss trend remains at about 4% with no significant change in the underlying texture from previous quarters. Looking at homeowners, production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of about 8.5% while retention remained at 84% and new business volume was up from the prior year quarter due in part to a lift from the improved auto new business. From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio was approximately 80%, an improvement of close to 1.5 points versus the first quarter of 2013 and was driven by lower expenses, earned rate increases in excess of loss trend, partially offset by non-CAT weather-related losses. With that, let me turn it over to Gabi.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Before we open it up for questions and answers, may I ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, please. Thank you. We can now open it up for the question and answer period.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Thank you. I had a question, actually \u2013 Jay, has anything changed in terms of your philosophy around CAT or non-CAT weather reserving philosophy, just because it looks like this year and we\u2019ve seen a little bit recently non-CAT weather creates difficult comps on the underlying but provides for favorable reserve development for prior year. So is that coincidence that those\u2014I\u2019m just curious, has that changed in the last year or two? Thanks.\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. There\u2019s no change in the way we go about reserving. Reserving is based on the actual storms that take place and then the assumptions that surround that, and one of the things that we\u2019ve had some difficulty with has been the weather patterns of the last several years. If you recall, not so much last year but the couple of years before that, when there was a lot of tornado experience that was creating both non-CAT as well as CAT weather, there was oftentimes a lot of hail with that and when the hail manifested itself, usually it was several months later and some cases even longer periods of time than that, and particularly last year what we saw when we had storm activity was first of all, an expectation on our part that the hail development would continue as we had been seeing it, and in fact what turned out to be the case was there was very little hail emersion, if you will, that came about.  So there\u2019s nothing really different about the way we\u2019re reserving, but it\u2019s just using the facts and circumstances that emerge over time to come up with the best estimates and then revise those when new information comes up.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Got you. Great, thanks. I guess the other question I\u2019m talking about, really focusing on the lowest performing cohort and taking as much rate as you can there. Brian, it seems that that\u2019s also been a philosophy that\u2019s been in place for a little while. How much more do you think opportunity there is in that cohort to continue to push for right-sized rate? How long will it take to push that cohort into the good bucket? Thanks.\nBrian McLean: Yeah, so a couple points in there. When you look at that cohort, we will continue to move stuff up\u2014we don\u2019t have the crystal ball to know exactly when and what we\u2019ll be able to do going forward. When we look at the results that we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, we are encouraged that we don\u2019t see any change, so we continue to work it account-by-account.  You know, one of the things\u2014you started with we kind of get as much as we can. The philosophy is a little different than that. We\u2019re looking at these\u2014in every cohort, there\u2019s always a distribution of accounts. We\u2019re looking account by account within that cohort. We\u2019re trying to work with the customer and with the agent to come up with what\u2019s the appropriate number for that account. In aggregate, we\u2019ve been able to maintain at about that 20% rate increase level, but there\u2019s a distribution of accounts within there, so we\u2019ll continue to work at it. There will always be new business that we\u2019ll write that will\u2014you know, we don\u2019t write new business planning for it to be in cohort five, but there will be some that will end up there. There will be other accounts that will have loss experience that will have them deterioriate and they\u2019ll go down into cohort five; but as you can see from the data we showed, it is continuing to shrink so it will never get to zero. But right now, we feel pretty good that we are still able to take the actions we need to take on the accounts in that cohort, and where we can we\u2019re happy to retain the business, and where we can\u2019t we lose some of it.\nMichael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs: Okay, great. That helps. Thank you very much.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Thank you. The first question I had is on the merger and acquisition environment, and clearly we\u2019ve seen a more hostile environment emerge in Bermuda. I know that\u2019s not at all a focus area for Travelers, but Jay, I was wondering if you\u2019d focus on the M&A environment currently and whether you might be interested in more bolt-on deals like the Dominion opportunity, or perhaps even something more transformational.\nJay Fishman: Sure, Jay. We don\u2019t compete in the reinsurance arena at all, actually, so I don\u2019t have any particular insight into that segment or the dynamics around it. You all understand that, have a different view of that than I ever could, so I\u2019ll leave that to your commentary. Our own situation is really unchanged, which is that we\u2019ll look at anything because you always learn by whatever you look at, but our interest is very selective. We\u2019ve achieved a level of performance and returns and profitability that we at least domestically don\u2019t need to be any bigger to be successful. If we can be and continue to be successful, that\u2019s fine. Being bigger and being less successful is a bad trade-off, so we\u2019re always evaluating whatever we look at in the context of return on invested capital \u2013 on invested capital, importantly. It\u2019s margins, profitability, all that, so I\u2019d say that our interest domestically remains unchanged but relatively highly selective. We\u2019ve always said that there were a few environments outside the United States that from a long-term perspective we were quite interested in. Brazil was one of them and we had the opportunity to partner with the Malucelli firm, and that transaction has gone just really well. In the context of a joint venture where so many things can go wrong, so many things in this one have gone right, and it\u2019s really been a terrific experience. It\u2019s actually reinvigorated my belief that you can actually do a joint venture and have both parties feel good about it and be successful and do good business. Canada was opportunistic in that there were very few acquisition candidates that were really available. This was a decision by the owner of Dominion to exit the business strategically. We were approached with a very small number of other people, and it moved us, as I commented before, I think the numbers were from 21st largest in Canada to now the 10th largest, but at 21st you\u2019re not sustainable. It really becomes difficult to hire talented people, to invest in systems and infrastructure. I don\u2019t mean to say that the people who worked for Travelers of Canada were not talented \u2013 they obviously were. It just puts a stress on the organization, so having the opportunity to acquire Dominion, and then most importantly \u2013 most importantly \u2013 there were two elements of it that were intriguing to us.  First, we thought they were on the right path to doing the right things to make their own business more profitable. We thought we could accelerate the time frame, that our skills, size and scale, and our experience that we\u2019ve had could accelerate that. And then, the more intermediate and longer term aspect of taking our commercial products, exporting them up into Canada and using Dominion\u2019s remarkable distribution organization to leverage, that remains just right clear in focus. It\u2019s just so important for us to do.  I\u2019ve expressed before, although I\u2019m less optimistic that it will happen\u2014you know, I\u2019d love to find us in India in some way. The challenge there is that it takes a tremendous amount of time and investment \u2013 not dollars, because it\u2019s a relatively small market, time and investment in people and infrastructure, management attention for a 26% ownership, and it\u2019s difficult to make sense of that. If we had a higher degree of confidence that that regulatory prohibition would be lifted and it would become 49%, we\u2019d be more aggressive. There are certainly plenty of partners in India who have raised their hand and have expressed interest in partnering with us, so the identification of a partner is not the issue. The issue is making real sense of an investment longer term. You know, we\u2019re a P&C company \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be. There may be other environments that will pop up and we\u2019ll take a look at. Continental Europe broadly is over-insured and under-returned, and doesn\u2019t hold a lot of excitement for us, so it\u2019s going to be case-by-case. We hope to use the venture in Brazil to look at other South American opportunities, so we\u2019ll continue to find those spots where we think that our skills, the attributes, the partner\u2019s ability to bring value to the transaction makes sense, and we\u2019ll invest in it. So that\u2019s as comprehensive an answer as I can give you.\nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: It\u2019s very comprehensive \u2013 thank you. And then just on capital management, with the increase in the dividend and the strong level of retained earnings, any thoughts as to whether Travelers could increase the combined share buyback and dividend to be more than an annual level of operating income going forward?\nJay Benet: Well, the basis upon which the capital management starts is with the operating company capital, so to the extent that you\u2019re making\u2014your earnings are creating capital that you don\u2019t need, that is the basis for the share buybacks and the dividends. We\u2019re always looking at other things that will free up capital. You might recall from a couple of years ago, we mentioned that we had reductions in the amount of reinsurance recoverables we had, or there was a sale of a runoff business, that both freed up capital. So we look for those kinds of opportunities, but those are things that may or not happen. The real juice, the real underlying current that gives rise to the ability to return capital, that\u2019s the earnings. \nJay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Great, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nJosh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: Good morning and congratulations on a great quarter. So first, just a question of the numbers and how we should think about them. Last year you guys ran, I think, over a 15% ROE; this quarter was nearly 18%, and the accident year ROE that you mentioned earlier, I think rounds up to 15. I know we all need to normalize for many things, as I think you guys do internally; but when you think about where you are, what should we think of as sort of where you are in your core run rate ROE, and how far really are you from the mid-teens ROE target that you have over time? I mean, are we there, and if not, how much\u2014if you sort of bring this back to the point, how much more rate momentum do you think you would need to get us to that target?\nJay Fishman: Josh, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. We\u2019re not there \u2013 most definitively, we\u2019re not there. In order to achieve our goal, and it\u2019s not vague by intention, it\u2019s vague because our business is simply not as precise as some people tend to think. This mid-teens ROE over time, to achieve that, you\u2019re going to have to achieve periods of time where you exceed mid-teens, because there will be good weather, there will be bad weather, and that\u2019s going to move back and forth. So we still have to make progress, so there\u2019s no particular change in our approach, our philosophy, what we\u2019re trying to achieve. Jay will tell you that if you take out the workers\u2019 comp assessment change, that impacts ROE by \u2013 was it 90 basis points or something? By something like 90 basis points, so you can take the 14.6 and you can make it\u2014you know, there are so many moving parts and so many unusual\u2014unusual? Every quarter has unusual pluses and unusual minuses, and they just keep washing out over time. We have more to do if we\u2019re going to get back on track. At this level of interest rate, I\u2019m still not 100% convinced that it is achievable in today\u2019s environment. We said several quarters ago \u2013 I\u2019ll reiterate it today \u2013 it remains an aspirational goal. I think that it\u2019s critical in an organization to express a strategic goal, and absent something fundamentally changing that\u2019s permanent, sticking with it. It\u2019s not just words that we use here in a webcast; it\u2019s embedded in the systems by which we price product, it\u2019s embedded in the systems by which we evaluate risk selection. It\u2019s what people in the field, underwriters, understand their mission to be, so we don\u2019t mess with it lightly. We leave it as is because it takes so long to get the DNA of an organization to reflect these strategic initiatives. We\u2019ve got two things going on: interest rates remain at overall historical lows, and the weather patterns are simply less predictable than they were. Both of those remain, and we are not yet at the pricing level, so we\u2019re going to keep going. I don\u2019t know exactly how to quantify it \u2013 I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m not holding back. I don\u2019t know how to quantify X-points of rate in various businesses and various product lines and help you\u2014I wish we had that kind of granular understanding about returns and losses and the rest. I just don\u2019t know how to do it. I just know that as I look at each quarter and analyze it and break it down, we\u2019re still not there yet.\nJosh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: That\u2019s helpful. This is going to seem like a non sequitur in a way because you\u2019re still raising pricing, but if we\u2019re all sort of looking forward and trying to look maybe six months out again, so what we\u2019ll be talking about in six months and things like that. The question if I ask you sort of a bigger question, Jay, this used to be a boom and bust sector, and I think you called\u2014you know, among the first to sort of get the post-cycle idea out into the discussion three or four years ago, and no one believed you. But with improvements in data analytics and more responsible behavior across the board, we\u2019ve seen three years of pricing firming, so everybody is starting to dust off questions as pricing slows, look back at history and sort of what does history tell us. Last time we saw pricing start to slow, there was seven years of price cutting and a 40% decline in commercial lines. It was obviously a different story \u2013 you know, the backdrop was very different; but I\u2019m wondering as you guys sort of put your strategic planning hats on and you think about the market, can you help us think about what here has been structurally changed? If we were to put on a three to five-year view, what do you think we\u2019ll see if we move decisively past the firming part of the cycle?\nJay Fishman: Sure, and I\u2019ll start off by saying we could be wrong. Just because we believe it and manage our business that way, doesn\u2019t by definition mean it will be right. It\u2019s entirely possible that we just don\u2019t see it right, and it\u2019s important because otherwise you always have to consider the prospect of what if you\u2019re wrong. We\u2019ve been talking about much less amplitude in the cyclicality of our business for a lot more than three to five years. I think you can go back almost 10, certainly 8 where it began to get increasingly clear to us that the factors that we thought had contributed to that remarkable cyclicality were being moderated. They were much better data. I know that we led that effort because of our history, but we\u2019re not unique in the sense of one and only in that regard \u2013 better data, better analytics broadly across the business and the industry, particularly amongst the best competitors. I think that Sarbanes Oxley actually had a meaningful impact on our business. It brought boards of directors into the discussions of reserve setting and the controls and procedures behind it. Those were really good things not because they changed bad behavior, because you can presume that in my comment \u2013 I don\u2019t mean it that way \u2013 but it improved the processes. It\u2019s fundamentally improved the processes by which managements are held accountable, which boards embrace. That\u2019s a big deal. That was a meaningful change in our industry that I don\u2019t think a lot of people really understood, and I believe that now. So now, I\u2019ll tell you\u2014at least this is a Travelers\u2019 view. I\u2019m not speaking for anybody else, but I will tell you for us, the question that we get asked probably more than any other, which we just scratch our heads about, is now that returns are where you want them to be, why don\u2019t you grow? And talk about a non sequitur question \u2013 it\u2019s one that we so struggle to understand. There is a presumption in that question that we can moderate our rate gains on the margin and somehow grow our business and change behavior. First of all, I don\u2019t how to moderate thousands of transactions in any given quarter one at a time and move it on the margin. We give our folks tools, we give them processes, we give them goals, and we let them manage it; and the numbers in the end, end up the way they end up. We also don\u2019t believe that you can on the margin grow your business by cutting price marginally. I think \u2013 we think that\u2019s just a fool\u2019s approach to the business. If you really want to use price as that type of a competitive approach, you\u2019ve got to cut it to the point where you\u2019ll accept materially lower returns than anybody else. That will change it, and my guess is it will be at a level of profit that is simply unsupportable for the long term. So we at least, we reject the notion that you can moderate pricing to grow your business.  Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that we are free from that obligation. We try really hard to grow our businesses, and in many cases we\u2019ve been extremely successful. It\u2019s not been based on price; it\u2019s been based on risk selection \u2013 importantly, identifying the competitive advantages that you have in your business and applying them more broadly to business opportunities that arise. We had the best national accounts workers\u2019 comp business there was, and lots of you have been exposed to that and you understand the competitive dynamics that exist and the advantages we bring. Once we decided that we could apply that expertise to the small commercial business, we were able to grow that segment in small commercial meaningfully \u2013 really meaningfully, and it mattered.  In our middle market business when we decided to get much more specific and program-driven, less generalist, we\u2019ve actually been able to grow the premiums from going back to \u201905 a little over $2 billion to now a little over $3 billion in that business \u2013 real growth not by price, because in that period of time largely price has either been flat or its increased, but by identifying segments of risk \u2013 risk return where the return trade-off was worthwhile and it made sense for us to apply those competitive advantages. So we\u2019re not\u2014we may get dragged into it. Maybe there will be other competitors that will be willing to accept sub-par returns at a level that at some point force everybody to respond \u2013 that was the old days. I think the industry is smarter than that \u2013 I may be wrong, but I think it is. We\u2019re running our business with that in mind, and I\u2019m hopeful \u2013 hopeful \u2013 that that will convert into a financial services business, an industry in P&C that looks more like so many others \u2013 greater consistency, less volatility. That level of volatility is in no one\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not even in the customers\u2019 interest. It\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest. Consistency of risk management and its costs are important economically, and I\u2019m hopeful that we will get there. But ultimately, every company makes its own decision, every company pursues its own strategy, so all I\u2019m expressing to you is ours, recognizing that we could be wrong.  But that\u2019s my view of why things are different, our view of why things are different today than they were perhaps 20 years ago.\nJosh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein: That\u2019s really helpful, Jay, thank you. Thanks, and good luck.\nJay Fishman: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore:\n : \nBrian McLean:  I lost track of the numbers you were doing, so you were looking at ex-CAT accident year\u2014\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Loss ratio, so that\u2019s about 60.2 points this quarter versus 60.4 points last year\u2019s first quarter, so that\u2019s a small improvement. Most of the improvement on the accident year combined ratio came from the expense ratio \u2013 I believe 150 basis points after the workers\u2019 comp. So since you\u2019re setting pricing in excess of loss cost, I would have thought that the loss ratio would have had more significant improvement.\nBrian McLean: Yeah, okay. Jay\u2019s got the numbers, so\u2014\nJay Benet: Yeah, without getting into the specifics of it, yes is how we react to it. I mean, the way we react is we obviously have some very specific views as to what the components of the changes are, so in blowing apart that 20 basis points, we look at what is the impact of rate earned in versus loss trend, right, and how does that compare to prior quarters and are the trends that we had been seeing inherent in this number that we\u2019re seeing here. The answer to that is yes.  We continue to earn in rate in excess of loss trends, and then the next obvious question is well, okay, if that\u2019s the case, how come it\u2019s not showing up? As you had said, this is a quarter where the weather has on a non-CAT basis as well as a CAT basis in an area like business insurance been much more of an impact than it was in the first quarter of last year. When you think about the weather this particular quarter with the winter storms, one of the questions that we had been mulling over here was if you look at the relationship of weather-related losses in BI versus PI, personal insurance, while it had weather events this quarter, they really kind of looked not all that dissimilar from where they had been in the prior year, and in the case of BI they were much higher both in terms of CAT and non-CAT. In looking further at that, we find that in business insurance, you\u2019re dealing with insureds that have many more flat roofs that when there are ice storms and snowstorms sustain more damage than sloped roofs and homes that people own, and then secondarily you have a lot of sprinkler systems in businesses and when sprinkler systems freeze and then water damage results, the damage is extensive, much more so than the homeowners business. So in pulling all these things apart, we look at the data, we look at the relationships, we look at the causality and see that it all makes sense to us, and in this particular case what you are seeing are the 20 basis points of improvement, but it is really the rate in excess of loss trend benefit being offset in large measure by the weather.\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: That\u2019s helpful. Just as a follow-up to that, we\u2019ve seen the expense ratio improve meaningfully. In this segment, that\u2019s the business insurance segment and the other segments. Curious as to whether this is repeatable and whether this is a function of management action because you feel the pace of rate increases are now starting to moderate. Thanks.\nJay Benet: Yeah, there\u2019s a combination of stories here. First of all, in business insurance, business insurance is where the benefit that we called out in the press release relating to the workers\u2019 comp assessments is coming through, so that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of what\u2019s taking place here. We continue to manage expenses very, very carefully in business insurance, and we are getting some benefit of expense leverage here that is also contributing to the reduction that you\u2019re seeing. But the primary driver in business insurance was the reevaluation of the estimated liability that we called out. In other areas, we have changes in commission rates that we\u2019ve talked about that have come through, also the expense saves that we talked about in PI. So there\u2019s lots of different stories, but it all goes back in most cases to a very diligent view as to how to manage expenses in those plays.\nVinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Helpful, thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nAmit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions. The first question is on loss cost trends in business insurance. Maybe using California comp as a backdrop, has anything changed in terms of loss cost trends when you look at Q1 versus Q4?\nBrian McLean: This is Brian. The short answer is no. Your comment of taking California comp as a backdrop, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever use California comp as a standard for things broadly across the book of business. So in our comp business and the other lines, really no significant movements at all this quarter from what we have been seeing historically.\nAmit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: I can see now I was unclear. I was alluding to SB863 and its impact. \nBrian McLean: Yeah, specifically in California?\nAmit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Yes.\nBrian McLean: You know\u2014yeah, I don\u2019t think we want to go that granular in talking about specific trends. I mean, we\u2019ve got a decent-sized book in California and continue to manage it on a granular basis and feel good about it, but\u2014yeah. Everything, all those changes are reflected in the results that we\u2019ve got in our book, so we would prefer not to delve that deeply into one state\u2019s specific actions.\nAmit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Okay. I guess sort of switching gears and going back to the discussion on Quantum 2.0, it\u2019s in 28 states right now. What I was trying to get at was how should we sort of think about the impact it might be having on premiums right now, i.e. is there some way to sort of segregate the impact when we look at the numbers?\nJay Fishman: It\u2019s Jay Fishman. In the aggregate, no. Were we to dive into the individual states where the product has been rolled out, what you would see \u2013 I\u2019m trying to recall \u2013 almost universally, maybe that\u2019s not exactly so, but you would see a meaningful increase in new business in each of those states. Because it\u2019s only been out for a few months and it\u2019s only still out in 28 states and the DofC, there is still some time to go before it evidences itself in our numbers.  I think the best that I could provide to you\u2014this is not a budget, I want to make it clear. It\u2019s not a budget; it is to some extent a guess on our part, and of course competitive reaction can change all of this. Our guess is that if we keep going at the pace and things remain as unchanged as they are now, that by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, we will achieve break-even status, meaning that in the fourth quarter the book will no longer be shrinking. So it will shrink again in the second quarter, it will shrink again in the third. By the time we get to the fourth, we should be able to hit break-even, and that gives you, I think, a sense of its intermediate term impact on a book of our size. Remember that it\u2019s all new is coming out on 2.0. Dual is at the agent\u2019s discretion based upon the individual customer\u2019s need, and I\u2019m being reminded her by everybody that in my comment about the fourth quarter is that that\u2019s policies in force, not premium dollars. Policies in force should, we hope given everything we see, we\u2019d project to flatten out in the fourth quarter.\nAmit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Got it. That is extremely helpful. \nGabriella Nawi: Sorry \u2013 this is Gabi. Just to remind you that you can also see on Page 18 of the webcast that new business in auto has picked up pretty meaningfully, and that\u2019s obviously largely driven by Quantum 2.0.\nJay Fishman: Totally driven.\nGabriella Nawi: Totally driven.\nAmit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for the answer.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. Two questions. The first is in the management liability business, we see an increase\u2014an acceleration, I should say, of the price increase. I guess I\u2019m a little surprised by that. I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s happening in that business. And then secondly related to Canada and Dominion, are you able to take capital out of that business now, and if not, when will you be able to?\nAlan Schnitzer: Jay, it\u2019s Alan Schnitzer. Let me start with the first one and then I\u2019ll turn the second one over to Jay. In management liability, what you\u2019re seeing there is our peak seasonal price change. That\u2019s got two components \u2013 one is rate and one is exposure, so the rate underlying that sequentially in quarters would be pretty consistent, up slightly but I would call it consistent with the prior quarter. What you see in addition to that, though, is exposure, and that\u2019s us being able to improve our position in some accounts that have been performing well, and in some cases from an excess position to a primary layer, and then just an improvement in ratable. So it\u2019s really those two pieces that you\u2019re seeing there.\nGabriella Nawi: Sorry \u2013 it\u2019s Gabi. Just to clarify, it\u2019s renewal premium change on the page in the webcast, not renewal price change.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it.\nJay Benet: As it relates to your question about the capital position and taking capital out of Canada, the first and foremost is looking at the opportunity that we have with Dominion to both integrate it, get it into the Travelers in as seamless a fashion as we can, and then take advantage of the business opportunities up in Canada. So we will maintain a capital base in Canada that will support those business activities, and your question is a good one but it\u2019s complicated by both profitability and growth, and we\u2019ll just manage it very carefully up there.\nJay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Okay, thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Please go ahead.\nRandy Binner \u2013 FBR: Great, thanks. On the change in the SMA liability for workers\u2019 comp state assessments, could you clarify what states that applies to and what exactly changed in the nature of that assessment?\nJay Benet: Yeah, this is Jay Benet again. The state is New York State, and New York has been going through some rethinking of how they manage things associated with workers\u2019 comp. You might recall from last year, I think it was in the first quarter, maybe the second\u2014the first? We had had a change in the way certain reopened workers\u2019 comp claims were funded, and that actually had a cost to us last year that went through prior year development. What New York State has done recently is change the way they fund the workers\u2019 comp bureaus in New York, and effective 1/1 of this year instead of doing something that they had done historically \u2013 and without getting into all the complications associated with it \u2013 we had, along with others, charged policyholders surcharges in particular years and then collected those. That was the basis upon which we were supposed to be funding at a later time what the costs were that we were being assessed by New York State for operating their various bureaus. There was a disjoint, frankly, between what our surcharges were and what we were actually assessed by the State of New York, and at times we saw that assessment being higher than what we had collected and that caused us to look at our obligations for that and build up an estimated liability associated with that. When New York State changed the law effective 1/1, it didn\u2019t change the surcharges we had collected; in fact, there was a true-up period where you looked back four years from that date, you looked at what you assessed in that time frame\u2014I\u2019m sorry, what the surcharges were in the time frame, what you had paid, and then settled up with New York. And we paid that, but what it did was it eliminated going forward this uncertainty as to a breakage, if you will, between the surcharges and the assessment. So this estimated liability for that breakage in effect was what we no longer required, and going forward the matching of the surcharges and the payments to New York State will be something that will be very definable, so there\u2019s really no need for this estimated liability anymore. It\u2019s a one-time thing. It\u2019s a true-up, and it\u2019s not something that will recur. \nRandy Binner \u2013 FBR: And it transfers to the expense ratio rather than the loss ratio because it\u2019s more of a pay-as-you-go?\nJay Benet: No, it\u2019s goes through taxes, licenses and fees. It\u2019s just the way statutory accounting works. \nRandy Binner \u2013 FBR: Okay. Understood. I guess the follow-up there is that everything you described is more procedural, but has there been any other kind of reform or structural change to the way New York approaches that second injury fund?\nJay Benet: Nothing this year. Like I said, last year there was a change\u2014\nRandy Binner \u2013 FBR: Nothing like an SB863 in California? Nothing to fix the real problem \u2013 this is more just procedural on how it operates?\nJay Benet: This is procedural as to how the funding of this particular element operates, yes.\nRandy Binner \u2013 FBR: Okay, that\u2019s perfect. Thanks.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair: Thanks. Good morning everyone. My question is around workers\u2019 comp. Clearly you\u2019ve been working on that line pretty hard, and the accident year in 2013 came down by several hundred basis points. For this year and next year, can we expect more of a gradual change, or is it possible you could see some more significant improvement also?\nBrian McLean: You\u2019re talking about in the combined ratio in the\u2014\nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair: Yeah, in the workers\u2019 comp.\nBrian McLean: It\u2019s tough to forecast what we\u2019re going to see. I mean, I think we feel great about our comp experience and the capabilities we have and the risk selection we\u2019ve gone through, and feel confident that we\u2019re appropriately recording the things as we see them today.\nJay Fishman: And our pricing strategies, it\u2019s similar to what we described earlier. Where there are accounts that have been poor performing or under-returned, we\u2019ve been seeking rate gains to improve the profitability, and ultimately that will evidence itself in the numbers. So I\u2019m not\u2014yeah, other than that, do loss costs develop as we contemplate they will, that\u2019s always the variable.\nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair: Okay. And how are medical loss cost trends running?\nBrian McLean: Consistent with what our expectations have been. We\u2019re not going to disclose specific numbers there \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have in the past, but we\u2014you know, you can read what\u2019s going on in medical loss cost inflation broadly in society and in the economy, and it\u2019s higher than normal inflation but something that\u2019s consistent. I think for us, one of the things that is really fundamental to our success in this line is literally 20 years ago, we decided we were going to invest heavily in our abilities to manage the medical component of the comp claims, and I think we\u2019ve got clearly industry-leading capabilities there and that really matters for us. So we\u2019re obviously looking at what the trend is on our book, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s different than what other companies are seeing, but it\u2019s clearly been within our expectations and something we watch very, very closely but right now feel good about.\nAdam Klauber \u2013 William Blair: Okay, thanks a lot.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. This will be our last question. Thank you.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital: Thanks. I\u2019ll make it a quick one. I think last quarter, Alan kind of suggested that for SBI to think in terms of 92 underlying combined ratio for this year. The first quarter came in a couple of points better than that, and you guys referenced the management liability treaty as being partly a factor. Does that change that suggested guidance for the year?\nAlan Schnitzer: Hi Larry, it\u2019s Alan. No, it doesn\u2019t. So we certainly took that into account when we gave the outlook a quarter ago, so if you look in our 10-Q and you look in the outlook, we really say the same thing about the balance of the year, meaning the next three quarters we expect to be broadly consistent with full-year \u201913. So obviously, we did come in under that in the first quarter, so if you just do the math, that would suggest a slight improvement on the full year. But again, I\u2019d just point you back to the words broadly consistent and tell you that we continue to expect the same.\nLarry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital: Okay, great. Thanks. \nOperator: Ms. Nawi, I will now turn the call back over to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.\nGabriella Nawi:  Very good. Thank you all for joining us today. As always, Andrew Hersom and myself are available in Investor Relations for additional questions. Thank you all, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you to please disconnect your lines."}], "2016": [{"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 4, "year": 2015, "date": "2016-01-21 14:27:06", "content": "Executives: Gabriella Nawi - SVP of IR Alan Schnitzer - CEO Jay Benet - Vice Chairman and CFO Brian MacLean - President and COO Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman, CEO of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance Bill Heyman - Vice Chairman and Chief Investment Officer\nAnalysts: Jay Gelb - Barclays Randy Binner - FBR & Co.

And now, Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter. As I'm sure you've seen, we reported operating income of $886 million or $2.90 per share and operating return on equity of 15.8%. That caps off another terrific year with operating income of just over $3.4 billion, operating income per diluted share of a record high $10.87 and operating return on equity of 15.2%. Our underwriting results across the board remains strong as you can see from our combined ratio of 86.6% for the quarter and 88.3% for the year. In domestic business insurance consistent with our marketplace objectives, we achieved a record level of retention in the quarter with positive renewal rate change. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we generated an all time best underlying combined ratio of 80.1% for the year. Broadly speaking, the market dynamics in the commercial insurance marketplace continued to be remarkably stable. In personal lines, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations. In agency auto, we had year-over-year policy in force growth of 8% in the fourth quarter, and as you can see in the webcast that's the sixth consecutive sequential quarter of increasing discount. Those of you who have been following our agency auto know what a success it has been. We are also pleased to be seeing an impact from the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 in our homeowners business, and you'll hear more about that from Doreen. Jay Benet will have more to say about our current investment results, but I\u2019ll just note that we have delivered pretty exceptional returns on equity for quite some time notwithstanding over the headwinds in the investment arena. Historically, low interest rates, the decline in energy prices, and volatility in the equity markets just is examples from this quarter. This speaks volumes about our ability to select in price underwriting risk and the strength of our insurance franchises. Just as a data point, our after-tax net investment income is about $1 billion lower in 2015 as compared to its high in 2007. On the other hand, our after-tax underlying underwriting margin is about $1 billion higher in 2015, than it was at its low in 2011. Particularly to the extent the fixed income yields remain low and that seems like the outlook for at least some time. And with capital finding its way into the largest end of this business, expertise and generating underwriting returns and having strong franchises in the smaller middle marketplaces with meaningful barriers to entry will really matter. Turning to capital management, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned nearly $1.2 billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter and nearly $4 billion during the year. For long time consistent strength of our results since behind our capital management strategy. Just as we have for nearly a decade, we will continue to right size capital and invest profitably in the business. Things to that strategy we have now returned close to $35 billion of capital to shareholders since the middle of 2006 when we started our share repurchase program. Let me take just a minute to comment on the leadership transition. What I suspect many of you want to hear from me is where do go from here? As I've explained to our leadership team, our challenge is this, to take today's summit and make it tomorrow's base camp. I'm confident that we already have the right strategy in place to do that and we've got the right team to execute it. We've been executing it. We understand it and it has been remarkably successful. It's this team's strategy. Delivering superior returns overtime will continue to be our North Star. We'll do that by investing in and leveraging our competitive advantages, delivering industry-leading products and services, and making sure this is a great place to work for the best talent in this industry. That's not to say that we won't challenge ourselves constantly to make sure that both the strategy and the way we are executing on it remains relevant. It's critical that we reassess all the time and we will continue to be a leader in evolving and innovating, particularly given the potential for change around this. Among other things, we'll continue to refine our data and analytics to make sure that we lead in reselection and pricing. We'll continue to innovate on the product side and our claim in risk control organizations to make sure that we're delivering at the forefront for agents, brokers and customers. And we'll continue to build on our leading position with our distribution partners to make sure that we're partner of choice for them. We've always understood the value of size and scale and we're well-positioned in that regard. Just as in the past, we'll seek opportunities to grow thoughtfully and in ways that contribute to shareholder value. And as always, we'll manage our expenses thoughtfully. All of that is business as usual for us. Our confidence in our strategy and our track record in executing on it give us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks Alan. As Alan mentioned, we're very pleased with our results this quarter; net income per diluted share of $2.83, operating income per diluted share $2.90 and an operating ROE of 15.8%. These results were driven by the continuation of our very strong current accident year underwriting performance as evidenced by an underlying combined ratio of 90.7% despite relatively high non-cat weather related losses in the quarter. Net favorable prior year reserve development was very strong at $292 million pretax and cat losses were relatively modest at $46 million pretax. That said, as shown on Page 4 of the webcast, current quarter results were lower than our very strong fourth quarter of 2014 results, mostly due to the impact of low interest rates and private equity returns on net investment income and in even higher amount of net favorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter. Underlying underwriting margins were pretty much the same in both quarters. Fixed income NII of $422 million after-tax was down $31 million from the prior year quarter, principally due to what we have been saying for many years. Securities has had higher book yields have gone off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current low interest rate environment. Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation. Looking forward based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect to the impact of lower reinvestment yields and a lower level of fixed maturity investments could in 2016 result in approximately $20 million to $25 million of lower after-tax NII on a quarterly basis when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015. Non-fixed income NII of $25 million after tax was down $42 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower private equity returns. Private equities essential broke even this quarter as compared to earning $30 million after tax in the prior year quarter due to lower valuations for energy-related investments. Each of our business segments continue to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development and business in international insurance, net favorable development of $176 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in workers comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2014. In general, liability for both primary and excess coverage\u2019s for accident years 2012 and prior and then the company's operations in Canada. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $80 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience and fidelity ensured date, for rest of the years 2012 through 2014. And in personal insurance, net favorable development of $36 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in auto liability for accident years 2013 and 14 and in homeowners and other liability for accident year 2014. As I have done in the past, I'd also like to provide you with some insight into what our combined 2015 scheduled peak is expected to share when it's filed on May 01. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years in the aggregate across all product lines are expected to develop favorably and all that one product line on scheduled peak are expected to develop either favorably or show very modest or de minimis unfavorable development. The product line that is expected to develop unfavorably by approximately $50 million free tax is products liability occurrence but another product line other liability occurrence will have an offsetting amount of favorable development as we've refined our allocation of IBNR between these two components of general liability based upon how losses, such as those related to construction defect have been developing by coverage type. In total, our general liabilities were not - general liability reserves were not affected by this action. Returning to GAAP for the year we had net favorable development of $941 million pretax with approximately $840 million coming from our U.S. ops and a little over $100 million coming from our Canadian and U.K. operations. There are two additional topics I'd like to update you on. As shown on Page 21 on the webcast, we renewed our corporate cat aggregate XOL Treaty effective January 1. The treaty provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior year, but at a lower cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad parallel and geographic coverage in the same positioning of the coverage layer providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions. And please note that the total cost of this treaty and therefore the reduction and cost are quite small in relation to our operating income. The second topic relates to the recent drop in oil prices. Page 22 of the webcast contains updated information showing the magnitude of our investments in below investment-grade energy bonds and energy-related equities. And you can see that some of these investments is relatively small and the exposure is quite manageable. Operating cash flows remain strong, $760 million in the fourth quarter after making a $100 million discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan bringing total operating cash flows to over $3.4 billion for the year. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategies as you heard from Alan. We returned to almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $183 million and common share repurchases of a little over $1 billion. For the full year, we returned almost $4 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $744 million and common share repurchases of over $3.2 billion. Holding company liquidly ended the year at $1.6 billion, well above our target level and our debt-to-total capital ratio, which was 23% at the beginning of the quarter slightly elevated due to our having issued $400 million of debt in the third quarter to prefund $400 million of debt that was maturing in the fourth quarter, has come back down to 22.1% well within its target range with the retirement of that debt. Net unrealized investment gains were almost $2 billion pretax or $1.3 billion after tax, which was down from $3 billion and $2 billion respectively at the beginning of the year due to an increase in interest rates and spreads. Book value per share of $79.75 grew 3% from the beginning of the year and importantly adjusted book value per share of $75.39, which eliminates the after tax impact of net unrealized investment gains grew by 6% this year. So with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks Jay. Business in international insurance results for both the fourth quarter and the full year was strong. We continue to generate excellent returns with a full year combined ratio of 92.1% and our retention throughout the year was very strong and reached a record level this quarter in our domestic business. Pricing trends remained relatively consistent with renewal rate change still slightly positive at the end of the year, while new business volume in our domestic business saw a modest increase. Turning to the quarter's financial results, operating income was $566 million with a very strong combined ratio of 89.6. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development was 94.4%, up a half a point compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to a higher level of non- cat weather related losses. Looking at the topline, net written premiums for the quarter were down about 1.5 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 with domestic business insurance premiums up about a point. In domestic business insurance we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. As we've been saying for some time, given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business our focus continues to be on retention and accordingly we\u2019re very pleased that retention improved to a record 85% in the quarter. Renewal premium change came in at 2.4 points, while renewal rate change remained positive but down slightly versus the third quarter. New business of $476 million was up compared to both the prior year and the third quarter. Looking at each of our individual domestic businesses beginning with Select, rate in renewal premium change were in line with recent quarters while retention remains strong at 82% demonstrating continued stability in this segment of the market. In the middle market, we achieved record retention of 88%, overall rate change was about flat and reflected a decline of about a point from the third quarter. As we've always said, the execution below the headline numbers is what matters and we continue to see a great about the granular results. Retention for our best performing business was just over 90% within average rate decline of less than 2% on those accounts, while for our poor performing business we continued to get a rate in excess of loss trend. In terms of exposure, the quarter's results include a drag of about a point from our oil and gas business resulting from reduced economic activity due to lower energy prices. Just as a reference point, our oil and gas business makes up only about 3% of domestic business insurance written premium. Middle market new business of $254 million was up from the third quarter and in line with the prior year. In other business insurance retention was strong at 80%, renewal rate change was about flat even after being negatively impacted by our national property business. As I mentioned last quarter, although national property is seeing the largest rate declines of any business in our portfolio, we are pleased with the overall performance of this business. Returns and retention remains strong and pricing trends are stable. Excluding national property, renewal rate change for other business insurance remains positive and was relatively stable with the third quarter. Turning to international, net written premiums were down about 16% for the quarter and 14% for the full year primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rate. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums for the fourth quarter were down about 6% largely driven by declines in retention in Canada and to a lesser extent at Lloyd's. International retention was down in the quarter to 79%, however renewal premium change was slightly positive and new business for the quarter was very strong at $80 million up 18% year-over-year. In Canada, our competitive renewal environment adversely impacted retention across our book. However in June, we launched Optima, our new strategic insurance platform in Canada for personal insurance. Optima was modeled after our U.S. based Quantum Auto 2.0. product. We\u2019re in the early days of the roll-out but are pleased with the initial response as we are seeing a significant increase in new business volume. In Lloyd\u2019s, we continue to see a challenging markets resulting from global economic conditions particularly in our marine business. Offsetting this pressure, our two new business products that we have recently launched focused on renewable energy and global construction and early returns are encouraging. So all in for the segment, it was a terrific 2015 with strong financial results and what we see as a remarkably stable environment when our competitive advantages really matter to our customers and agents.  Before I turn it over to Doreen, I want to make one comment on our outlook for operating margins which we include in our quarterly fillings. Since our 10-K won\u2019t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect our 2016 underlying underwriting margins for the segment will be broadly consistent with 2015. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward looking statement disclaimers. With that, let me turn it over to Doreen.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance finished 2015 with another quarter of exceptional financial results. Operating income for the quarter was 162 million down from the fourth quarter of 2014 due to lower net favorable prior year reserve development but overall still a great result. The underlying combined ratio of 80.7 was three point, four points better than the prior year quarter due primarily to two factors, a modest increase in a loss ratio in the prior year quarter that resulted from a re-estimation of the first three quarters of 2014, and secondly the impact of certain customer related intangible assets which became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2015. Underlying underwriting results continue to run well within our long term target ranges and as Alan mentioned, the full year underlying combined ratio of 80.1 was an all time best. We obviously don't think these results come by accident. We pride ourselves on maintaining the underwriting discipline, aggressive management of risk and limits, strong accountant and agency relationship, analytics and claims management that drive these results.  As we look ahead to 2016 for this segment, we expect underlying underwriting margin to remain broadly consistent with 2015. As for top line net written premiums in the aggregate were down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline in surety volume driven by lower bonding needs for our accounts particularly as compared to the strong production in the fourth quarter of 2014. Surety production can vary significantly quarter-over-quarter based on the number, size and timing of bonded construction projects awarded to our customers. We have a strong portfolio of surety clients and believe we remain well positioned to capitalize on increased bonding needs that might result from an improved economy. Across our management liability businesses, retention remains strong at 85% while new business premium was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewal premium changed trended down with lower rate being partially offset by an increase in other RPC which includes changes in the size of insured exposures, in the midst written attachment point and policy duration. The lower rate was as expected and is consistent with the strong profitability of our portfolio. So all-in-all, another great quarter closing a strong year for Bond & Specialty Insurance. I'll turn now to personal insurance where we closed out the year with another quarter of exceptional underwriting results. So the segment operating income for the quarter was 222 million and the underlying combined ratio was 86.2%. Great results and as we move forward the segment remains positioned to perform in line with our long term return growth. I'll touch on the quarterly results for agency auto and agency property in a moment but first I\u2019d like to share with you some thoughts on how we view the underlying health of these businesses. First for auto, I\u2019ll start by saying how pleased we are with the vibrancy of our auto business. The market response from both agents and consumers to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains incredibly strong and the portfolio is positioned to generate financial returns within our long term target range. In the agency channel we added 167,000 policies during 2015, an 8% increase from the end of 2014. As always there remains competition in auto and we remain committed to keeping our products priced accordingly through disciplined expense management and superior pricing and underwriting segmentation. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the auto business to continue to grow in both policy accounts and premium volume although at a more moderated percentage than 2015 as the portfolio grows. As per agency auto profitability, we\u2019ve mentioned on several occasions that we\u2019re comfortable with where our margins are given the current market environment. That still remains the case today. The full year underlying agency combined ratio of just under 97% was in line with our expectations for the year and a result we are pleased with. This combined ratio is somewhat higher than our long term goal. We have been particular by the amount of new business that we've added over the past two years. Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long term target returns. But as you all know, the relatively higher combined ratio of new business improves over time. As we look into 2016, the significant volume of new business we've added will drive a slightly higher calendar year combined ratio, compared to 2015. So far the profitability of Quantum Auto 2.0 is maturing in line with our expectation. With this return profile, we continue to seek more new business as it should be accretive to long term return. In homeowner, the financial returns generated in the last couple of years have been exceptional and well within our target range. As you recall, we made significant improvement in the risk profile of this business over the last few years including changes in deductibles, other terms and conditions, and tightened underwriting guidelines. Of course, this is a more volatile business that will always have a weather dynamic to it. The weather in the last couple of years has been somewhat lower than our model suggested. But we know that won't always be the case. As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the profitability - we do expect underlying underwriting margins in agency homeowners and other to be lower than 2015 reflecting more normalized levels of loss activity. As Alan mentioned, we are also very pleased with the improvements we've seen in homeowners production. This is attributable in part to account rounding along with making some localized pricing and process adjustments. And certainly the turnaround benefited from the momentum and agent engagement from the roll-out of Quantum Auto 2.0. At this point, the business has leveled-off from a policies and force perspective and we expect modest growth in 2016. Now, I'll just highlight a couple of things specific to the quarter. Looking at agency auto, new business premium was up 32% and net premium was up 12% from fourth quarter 2014 level and we have added 51,000 policies during the quarter. The combined ratio for the quarter was 98.1 and included over two points of favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio was a 100.2, up from the prior year due predominantly to adverse weather in this year's quarter and the benefit in the prior year quarter of a 2.5 point favorable re-estimation of losses related to the first three quarters of 2014. As per loss trend in auto, our view of normalized frequency and severity remained consistent with recent quarters at around 3% in aggregate. There continues to be a lot of discussion about trend, particularly increase in frequency. From our advantage point, while we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period due to things like weather, we see a stable and unchanged long term frequency trend. As always, we continue to monitor external information and our own data closely using our expenses analytic capability. Turning to agency homeowners and other for the quarter, we once again had strong financial results despite relatively active weather in the month of December. The underlying combined ratio of 59.5 was slightly higher than the exceptionally favorable prior year quarter. As for production, new business premiums were up 27% from the prior year quarter and continue to trend favorably, while retention remained strong at 85%. Policies in force were up slightly both sequentially from last quarter and from the fourth quarter of 2014. So to sum up personal insurance, we are exceptionally proud of the year we've had and look forward to more of the same in 2016. With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabi.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Doreen. Tina, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. If I can ask you all to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you very much. Tina, go ahead please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJay Gelb: Thank you and good morning. The first question I had was on the potential for share buyback. Alan, any change in view in terms of deploying loan excess annual earnings and share buybacks - got buybacks is \u2013 just slightly annually over the past - thinking we might put that trend in place for 2016, 2017 as well.\nAlan Schnitzer: Jay, good morning. Thanks for the question. No change in strategy or approach to share buybacks or capital management overall and there is no intent to this, it's never been an effort to deploy more than earnings right. We had excess capital in past years and we made that very clear that we were sort of adding that to our annual income to buy back stock but, we said I don't know, a year or two ago that our level of buybacks would be tied to our level of income. And so we\u2019ll have a level of earnings, we\u2019ll do what we need to do with it whether that\u2019s making pension contributions or investments in the business and we\u2019ll take what\u2019s left in and return that to shareholders and there won\u2019t be a perfect correlation between earnings in a year and share buybacks in a year. There is some timing differences but I think as we said pretty consistently recently, share buybacks going forward will be tied to earnings.\nJay Gelb: Okay. And then on the investment income from the non-fixed income investments, it was clearly impacted by lower energy prices in 4Q and given the collapse in energy prices so far this year, I\u2019m just trying to get a base on what you might expect for 2016, is that $25 million results, taking ahead lower on a quarterly basis from what we saw in 4Q.\nJay Benet: Let me just clarify one thing, $25 million that relates to fixed income portfolio not the non-fixed income portfolio.\nBill Heyman: Jay, its Bill Heyman. Obviously this week is a hard week from which to extrapolate for the rest of the year. The marks as of year-end reflected a price which was an oil price higher than the price which obtained today but not by as much as one might think. During the year most funds wrote down their holdings and in some cases after the write-downs the price of petroleum rose but nothing was written up again. So we think a lot of these portfolios have been marked pretty hard. That said, if we had to predict either way, there is probably a little downside left in the portfolio but the portfolio isn\u2019t that big that the amount are to be material then the aggregate.\nJay Benet: Okay, that's helpful for a starting point. And Jay just to clarify, so as talking about the $25 million of income in 4Q from the non-fixed income investment portfolio in terms of the \u2013 fixed income, I understand what you were saying in terms of lower - \nJay Gelb: I apologize for the confusion there.\nJay Benet: That's okay, no problem so, but Bill you\u2019re saying that $25 million after tax we saw in 4Q shouldn't be that impacted by lower energy prices even so far.\nBill Heyman: No, I couldn\u2019t put a number on this especially after the first part of this month but I\u2019m simply saying that everyone assumes that there is a lot of downside based on prices as they are today and there might be less downside than it appears simply because of the way in which funds mark their holdings in 2015. \nJay Gelb: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Tina. Next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Binner of FBR & Co. Please go ahead.\nRandy Binner: I think you touched on this in the opening commentary but from my perspective the pricing - the headline pricing number you provided in the slide-deck the plus 0.6% was better than expected and I guess I\u2019m interested in your perspective and if you think Travelers is unique here, a lot of the headlines surveys that we will get in the industry for commercial lines are moving significantly negative across the board. So I just want to get your perspective on it if you think Travelers is unique here and how kind of much discipline I guess you think - your competitors are holding against the software market?\nAlan Schnitzer: Randy, good morning it\u2019s Alan. You said it was a surprise, it wasn't a so a surprise to us, it may've been a surprise to you or others but relatively to the surveys what we can tell you is, we\u2019re showing a real data and I think what we\u2019ve always seen is surveys tend to be anecdotally based and tend to maybe over emphasize some volatility either up or down because maybe the people respond to the surveys or thinking about the last transaction or the transactions in their mind. So there is really nothing about this that surprises us and you know we've been saying for a while that we expect the amplitude of the market to moderate. This appears to have moderated and I think you know the fact that we can achieve what we did is, I think a function of two things, one our data and analytics, our expertise, our ability to execute at a very, very granular level and a marketplace that is, we would describe as remarkably stable and at the moment rational.\nRandy Binner: Just a quick follow up, are there any lines that are really helping that figure, meaning is workers\u2019 comp still kind of the best from a pricing perspective where some other casually lines might be moving negative?\nBrian MacLean: No, this is Brian. It's still a pretty tight band to be honest with you across all the lines. So nothing is dramatically out of pattern up or down. As we commented and Alan touched on in his comments and I in mine, it\u2019s a more larger accounts feeling more pressure than medium and smaller accounts as we said national property is the space where we\u2019re seeing you know more significant rate declines than others. So I think it\u2019s more an account size than a line of business volatility or variability.\nRandy Binner: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nannizzi: I guess Doreen maybe a little bit more on the auto side, have you seen any impact from the rise in miles driven in your auto book just given the fact that your growth is sort of come alongside that rise in miles driven?\nDoreen Spadorcia: So let me just talk a little bit about miles driven. The data shows that probably year-to-date the miles driven are up about 2.5% per capita and there is still a lot of debate about whether that makes a difference if it's a long trip, a short trip, whether there is unemployment, whether you have safety features in your vehicles, and so you know we watch that closely but our long term trend of 3% anticipate that and we really haven't seen anything that that particular item is causing us to view frequency differently today.\nBrian MacLean: And just to be crystal clear, the 3% is total trend where the frequency being a small fraction of it.\nMichael Nannizzi: And then I guess in middle market, I mean with retention up in the high 80s, is that something that you could see that maybe coming down or would you be comfortable with that at a lower level if you saw an opportunity to find some more rate increase opportunities. Just seems like high 80s if pricing is flat and the result are pretty good, I mean is that an area where you could look to push for some more rate at some point?\nBrian MacLean: This is Brian again. That is a constant balancing act in our organization every day. I will tell you that overall our core middle market business from a return perspective is in a very healthy spot and as I said in the comments when we look at our better performing business which is not a tiny part of the portfolio, our very well performing business, we are at retentions north of 90 with pretty modest price increases. We\u2019d obviously love to renew it in the 90s with different price increases but retaining that business is a real priority because it is returning very, very well. With that said, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to see where we can balance the rate and retention trade off.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, I'd add to that that, even though that\u2019s not the headline number, that continues to be a headline number and the execution below that number is very, very granular. So we\u2019re not managing that headline number, we\u2019re managing every single account.\nMichael Nannizzi: And just real quick. Alan or Bill, did you guys disclose - definitely appreciate your scores on the energy portfolio. Do you guys disclose anywhere you have the BBB minus category of energy exposure as well just that sort of next rating level up?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, I can say that the investment grade portfolio has an average rating of single A and the high-yield portfolio, which is 23 credits with book value of $162 million has an average rating of BB minus, which given the size or to give you what you need.\nMichael Nannizzi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nJosh Stirling: I was just thinking may you live an interesting times. You've had good fortune here to become CEO at the time the industry structure is changing very rapidly. I mean obviously over the past six months, we've seen ACE and Chubb merge. It creates a very large and powerful competitor. And on the other hand over at AIG there is presumably going to be lots of opportunities for everyone in the industry. As you thought from Travelers perspective, how the environment is evolving, how are you guys going to sort of tackle these new challenges and opportunities and what should we do to seek Travelers take advantage of all these change in the market?\nAlan Schnitzer: So I guess what I would share with you is that we are very aware and deeply engaged in all of those things. So whether that's - what's going on with any of our competitors or what's going on with technology or big data or driverless cars, consolidation among distribution, you could go on and on. I think what I would share with you is we're very aware and deeply engaged. As we see all of those things and others, those by the way weren't meant to be necessarily in order what's top in my mind, just what came to my mind but as we think of everything that's got the potential to change in this marketplace, nothing is going to change overnight. These are things that are all going to evolve and develop overtime. And what we've got great confidence in is our positioning to manage all of them. So we think we can understand and manage. We've got the talent, we've got the resources, we've got a deep understanding of risk and reward. And the quality of our underlying business, the results you see this quarter and this year, we've got no distractions. So we are starting from a really good point as we think about and engage on all of those issues. And without taking one by one, for the most part and maybe all in, we see more opportunities than we do risk. But we're certainly examining them from both sides making sure that where there is opportunity, we're positioning ourselves to be able to leverage it and where there is risk that we're making sure we do everything we need to do to mitigate it.\nJosh Stirling: I wonder if we could maybe just switch gears a little bit. You've mentioned risk. Could you give us a little bit of - either Alan or Brian or whoever is appropriate, a little bit of help of understanding what the liability side exposures maybe not Travelers per say, but generally for the industry from a meltdown and the commodities and energy patch would be. I mean presumably, we might see a bunch of bankruptcies, use a lot of different product lines that everybody in the industry sells under companies. And I remember a decade or so ago, Chubb really surprised people when they had got hurt and energy surety deal with Enron. And obviously both D&O and E&O exposures and maybe work comps severity. So I'm sure you guys are playing defense here. I'm wondering if you can help us sort of things through how you and your underwriters are thinking about potential exposures if they've had part of the role keeps getting hurt.\nAlan Schnitzer: I'll start and I'll look at either Brian or Doreen, and invite them to jump in. I'll say you sort of hit it. We think about the loss side of that equation all the time and whether it's going to our measure and liability book or surety book making sure that we understand what our exposures are. And I'll say that we look at these things - we don't wait for there to be something significant in the marketplace to look at it, we're looking at it all the time and as far out as we can. So we're managing our nets, we're looking on the surety side what kind of collateral we have for instance on some of these accounts. We exit accounts when we need to exit accounts. But we've got a really good track record I think in all of those businesses. So just on manageable liability side, for example, we're much more heavily waited on the private non-profit side as opposed to the large public D&O. And so it's - this is what we do every day is manage risk and think about risk and reward.\nDoreen Spadorcia: The only thing I'd add to that is that when we see any potential issue, we run that through our entire book of business not just what that class of business is. So we look at all the consequential effects that they may have on related industries. And so for example in writing bank we look at the level of their portfolios that are exposed not just to oil and gas, but any one thing in particular. So obviously, surety watching credit and looking at collateral, other management liability areas looking at concentration, but this is unique to us. We always take an issue and run it through the entire book and look at any consequences that might come from that.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: I think my first question is for Brian. And I think he mentioned in his prepared remarks that in middle market I think the better accounts you were - renewing I think with the modest rate decline. The decline, but it's kind of like it was only modest. I guess I'm just curious how is the conversation changing with those better accounts, now versus maybe a year ago. Right now like I said, something maybe a modest decline, I mean is that kind of where - whatever one is kind of looking for is still just modest or - how's that conversation evolving?\nBrian MacLean: It's pretty much as you're saying and as you would expect based on the data. A couple of years ago, almost every conversation was starting with some form of price increase even for the best accounts, because everybody saw where the trends were and that is gradually mitigated overtime. But even with those better accounts, the conversation start somewhere with trying to renew it at a modest decline or flat. Obviously, if the average is less than 2% there is still some that are positive. The thing that we're doing probably a little different than we were a year or two ago is we're really trying to get out as early as possible frequently at least three if not six months ahead of time, have conversations with the broker and the account. I think we do have a strong franchise with a valued product and valued services. And fortunately most of those company start by wanting to stay with us. And then I think the other key point is really being able to have the data and analytics where our frontline people can see and really segment their portfolio and in the middle market account by account. Look at how they're performing. And when there are issues either in that account, in that line or in that class of business being able to have an informed conversation with the broker about what those are and why we're trying to do what we're doing on the account really, really makes a difference. So I'd say the big change is getting out early and having a kind of granular conversation on the performance of that line and that business.\nRyan Tunis: My follow up was actually follow-up to Jay's question on capital return and excessive operating income. I guess since the start of 2014, we see like your premiums surplus ratio has drifted up from about 1% to 1.2%. Leverage has been relatively flat. You've said over the past couple of years you've had access. You've been able to deploy. How do we think about that level of access? Just because on those metrics it does seem like whatever access you did have, you have sort of used to at certain extend. Are those metrics even relevant?\nJay Benet: The premium to surplus ratio, I would view as not being relevant at all. I mean that was a ratio that was used at a time when rating agencies and regulators didn't have the sophisticated models they have today. So I've said on previous calls, we deal with each one of the models whether it's our internal models, regulatory models or the rating agency models to come to a place where given the profile of our business as it relates to each quarter what is the capital that we think we need in the operating entities that we manage to support AA rating and support a solid AA rating, not one with the wind blows we're worried about our ratings going down. So that's always the starting point. Given the size of our book, it doesn't change very much from quarter to quarter, but what does change is the profitability in each quarter. So there are some quarters where the profitability whether it's for favorable development or some other things to take place, it's higher than our expectations keeping in mind that we have a flow of monies out of the operating companies up to the holding company each quarter based on expectation. So to the extend we earn more. We bring some more up probably a little later than that. I think if you go back over time and you go pass two years ago to an earlier period and start adding up, the earning versus the share repurchase that you see that there is a very, very strong correlation to that. So I wouldn't read into anything that says one year we've done a little more than earnings, in other year we did less. It's really just as Alan said earlier the timing. The premium to surplus ratio goes up a little bit, I've kind of ignored that and what I would look at is in our supplement, we talk about specifically on a quarterly basis what the stat surplus is. And I think you can see that, that moves around probably in a pretty narrow band.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.\nVinay Misquith: Just a question on loss cost trend and the pricing roughly flat. Curious how you\u2019re managing to leave margins flat in '16 versus '15?\nBrian MacLean: So this is Brian. And speaking for the BII segment, you start with the kind of simple arithmetic of the earned premium. And again it's not just rate, its price, which includes exposure change and does offset some of trends. So when we look at the arithmetic of earned rate versus loss trend, we come up with a very modest about a 0.5% of loss ratio compression into 2016. And that of course is based on our assumption of loss trend, which is as we've said running right now at about 4% and looking at a relatively stable orderly marketplace. And then that's offset by a variety of other factors you can think of whether large losses mix change underwriting actions, et cetera. But the real starting point is that compression from the rate loss trend dynamic, price loss trends dynamic is a pretty modest number in how we're looking at it.\nAlan Schnitzer: And I think that distinction between price and rate is important, because as we said in the past there is a meaningful component of exposure that from a profitability perspective behaves like rate. And so what we really see in that true margin deterioration, is we see going forward as Brian said it's very small and probably within the margin of error of all the other things that impact margin.\nVinay Misquith: The second question is on the pace of future rate increases you mentioned that on a best counts you have, rate decreases of less than 2%. So curious to what proportion of the accounts now are well performing. So should we see sort for the pressure on pricing this year, because more of the accounts are better performing?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think there is a level of granularity and precision here that's for competitive reasons. I'm not going to overly segment the portfolio. I think the backdrop to this is really the view of, do we think the industry is going to continue to fundamentally be focused on the returns on the products. And we think that's the right way to be thinking about the business and we're optimistic that the majority of the marketplace is actually looking at that. So the healthier the business, the more pressure there should be on pricing, but in the aggregate we're pretty comfortable that we should be able to generate appropriate with pricing to maintain reasonable returns. And then you can come up with any variation on the theme you want off of that and be as bullish or as bearish as you want.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nCharles Sebaski: I have couple of question I guess on the personal lines business. I guess the first on the personal auto growth and the success you had from Quantum. Is that coming from standalone auto policies? I guess I'm trying to just understand that you kind of sweet spot seems to be on package, multi policy programs. You have auto growth while homeowners' is flat. Just kind of, wondering how you're working in the auto growth relative to your, kind of, packaged program?\nDoreen Spadorcia: Good morning, this is Doreen. We've actually seen success in force. I think this was some of what Alan and I referred to in our earlier comments. Clearly our auto product was competitive in agent's office and also in the direct channel. And in many cases, what that did, because we are an account focused company, that allowed us then to bring the home with it. So we've seen standalone auto come in, we've seen more opportunities for cross-selling. And I don't think it's anything small, given Quantum Auto 2.0 that we've been able to actually increase and stop the shrinkage in homeowners. We've also put some processes in place that have been very helpful where it prefills certain information so that if someone is looking at an auto quote, it will prefill for home. So we like the account business, we continue to look for that. But given where the returns are and where we're going with auto, we are pleased with that as well.\nCharles Sebaski: Just a follow up to a comment that you guys made in the business insurance regarding the exposure drag and the oil and gas exposure, I think you said that oil and gas accounted for one point exposure drag but that oil and gas only accounted for 3% of the book, or is that 3% of the exposure? I guess I was trying to understand how 3% could account for a one point drag.\nJay Benet: The 3% is a premium number but the exposure, as you can imagine, was down pretty significantly. So when you've combined the 3% against a pretty big exposure delta in oil and gas, that drove the 1%.\nGabriella Nawi: And the 3% is the total domestic business insurance, not to middle market in that written premium.\nJay Benet: So that's a good point and maybe we shouldn't mix those two numbers. The 1% drag was on the middle market exposure change. The 3% was on total domestic BI. So we did that arithmetic quickly. \nAlan Schnitzer: The 3% is the premium, the book. The 1% is on the charge and the exposure. The 1% exposure drag is middle market exposure, the 3% is quantifying a percentage of the premiums of our oil and gas business on the total business insurance.\nJay Benet: Right. The premium on just middle market would be a higher number.\nCharles Sebaski: The math just didn't seem to work, I appreciate the clarity.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. And this will be our last and final question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKai Pan: First question is on reserve releases. Looks like workers comp have releases in 2014 accident year, just curious while it is already release rather than for this - normally a long tail line of basis, can you talk also in general, what's loss cost trend by major lines and how that compare with your 4% assumption in overall loss cost trends?\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. Just in terms of the reserve release, when you're dealing with a long tail line, you've two components to how you're going to look to results. One is, what has developed in terms of loss activity, and you're absolutely right. In a short period of time, you're not going to really see a great deal of activity. On the other hand, what you've done is, you established the starting point for what you think the loss activity is going to be and we refer to that as the loss pick. So just imagine on January 1, trying to predict what the losses are going to be for the entire period of time as those workers comp policies will be out there. And we come up with a loss pick, and the example I'm going to use, I'm just making up a number, let's say it's 60%, based on what you've seen historically. And looking at the historical data then for earlier accident years and evaluating that against that initial loss pick that you had for a current year and there were times when you see loss activity in prior years that you say, that really has no barring whatsoever on how I thought about the starting point for the current year and then there are times, when you look at it and say, no actually this really does change the bar for the starting point. So usually on a long tail line of business when you see us do what we\u2019ve done here, it's based on what we refer to is base here moment. Looking at the history and just saying that, the initial loss pick was a little on the high side.\nA \u2013 Brian MacLean: This is Brian. Just to respond to your - trend by line in business is actually a pretty tight band with ranging from the high 3s to the high 4s but an average trend of right around 4%. So nothing is really out of pattern by line.\nKai Pan: My follow up question is for Alan. Now you have 7 weeks on the new role, so I just wonder what\u2019s your top priority these days and what you think - you have the right strategy in place now, but what are you focusing on?\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure. Thanks for the question Kai. So I had experienced managing essentially all of our commercial business and our businesses outside the U.S. what I haven't had experienced with is, the personalized business on a relative basis not as much, personalized business in some of our functions like claim and IT and ops and things like that, risk control, so, I\u2019m trying to spend a lot of time in those businesses and areas that I haven't had the experience with, trying to spend a lot of time on the road out in the field with distribution and our employees in the field which has always been a priority of mine. And I guess beyond that in my comments I said one of the things that we\u2019re going to do is continue to evolve and innovate and reassessing is something that we\u2019ve always done and Jay Fishman has always led that initiative. And so I have taken that over from Jay and just like Jay didn\u2019t do it alone, Jay did it with the group, I\u2019ll continue to leave the group in making sure that we\u2019re accessing what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and we\u2019re evolving and innovating. So I would say that makes up so the way I'm allocating my turn.\nKai Pan: Thank you very much for all the answers.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. Thank you very much for joining us today. As always, the Investors Relation team is available for any follow up questions you might have. Thank you and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect all lines.

Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all your questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 20, 2015. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our 2015 third quarter results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Alan Schnitzer, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Business and International Insurance and who as already announced will succeed Jay as CEO on December 1; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. They will go through the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now it\u2019s my pleasure to pass it to Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabi and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. By now you have seen our third quarter results and as you can see from the release it was a terrific quarter that adds meaningfully to our very strong 2015 year-to-date performance.  We reported operating income of $918 million and an impressive operating return on equity of 16.2%, bringing our year-to-date results from more than $2.5 billion in operating income and a nearly 15% operating return on equity. We achieved these results through very strong underwriting performances across all of our business segments and solid investment performance consistent with our expectations.  Our long term average annual operating return on equity stands at 13.4%, well in excess of our cost of capital and since 2006 we have returned a total of more than $33.5 billion in capital to our shareholders, remarkable numbers and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased.  We have shared with many of you that one of our missions over the last couple of years has been to identify that which we do right and institutionalize those behaviours to make sure that they have continuity and will continue to contribute to our absolute as well as our relative superior performance. Some of those behaviours are obvious and they include things like our remarkable expertise in workers\u2019 comp claim handling which certainly provides Travelers with a relative competitive advantage.  But as I reflected on this quarter\u2019s earnings as well as the string of quarters that we put together over the recent past, my hypothesis is that the competitive advantage of analytics, risk selection and pricing management have had a meaningful effect, particularly cumulatively. I can\u2019t prove it to you because I don't know what our results would have been if we weren't just good as we are. But I do believe that one of the important factors that has led us to produce industry-leading returns is the fact that we have managed the changing rate environment over the last five years as effectively as we have.  Everybody understands that our capital management policies have added to those returns and that analysis is easy to do. But I am a believer that the numerator in that calculation has been positively impacted and will continue to be so by the way we have managed with rate retention and capital allocation across all accounts. I am certain that it has mattered and you should know that the commitment to analytical insight that produces these advantages is very much a part of the DNA of this place.  In short, the place is in great shape. It was another impressive quarter. It\u2019s business as usual and it feels like the perfect time to be conveying the leadership to the next generation. And in that regard, let me turn the call over to Alan. \nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Jay and good morning. It was a great quarter and speaking for the next generation, we\u2019re very grateful to be stepping in with things in such great shape. Thanks for that Jay and congratulations.  I will share just a few thoughts this morning before Brian and Doreen take you through the segment results and let me start with personal insurance.  We are about two years into Quantum Auto 2.0 and the results have been excellent. Our initial loss experience is in line with our original estimates while the take-up of the product has been better and faster than we had anticipated. It\u2019s nice to see the industry auto policy count and premium growing, very well done and congratulations to the team.  In business and international insurance and bond specialty, we posted excellent results. We are pleased to see production in a quarter that reflects a continuation of the trends we have been seeing all year, very high and consistent retentions reflective of the stable marketplace and steady real premium increases at levels that are reflective of healthy returns. These results are consistent with the messaging we\u2019re giving to our field organization which is to retain those accounts that are meeting our return expectation and to try and improve the profitability on those accounts that don\u2019t.  In that regard, in our middle market business, we continue to be successful in improving the written margins on our quintile four and five business. As you\u2019ve heard us say many times, including in Jay\u2019s commentary this morning, we managed on a very granular account by account or class by class basis and giving current returns that blends to a very high retentions and stable renewal premium increases.  To sum it up, the operating and production results over the past nine months are very encouraging and taken together with our relentless focus on execution and deep and talented management team give us great confidence in our ability to continue to deliver superior returns.  And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Alan. As you heard from Jay and Alan, we are very pleased with our third quarter results: operating income of $918 million, up from $893 million in the prior year quarter and operating return on equity of 16.2%, up 100 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter. Current operating income was driven by a very strong consolidated combined ratio of 86.9% which was 3.1 points better than the prior year quarter. This improvement resulted from the continuation of very strong current accident year underwriting performance along with higher net favorable reserve development.  Operating income was also driven by solid net investment income which was consistent with our expectations although lower than the very strong prior year quarter. Fixed income NII of $422 million after tax is down $32 million from the prior year quarter principally due to what we have been saying for many years now \u2013 securities that had higher book yields have run off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields through the current interest rate environment.  Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation.  Non-fixed income NII of $68 million after tax was down $53 million from a very strong prior year quarter, primarily due to lower private equity and hedge fund returns. Private equities and hedge funds produced NII of $35 million after tax this quarter as compared to $79 million after-tax in the prior year quarter.  As I mentioned, earnings continued to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development which amounted to $199 million pretax this quarter, $86 million higher than the prior year quarter. In business and international insurance, net favorable development of $49 million pretax resulted from better than expected cat and non-cat weather-related losses in our property business for recent accident years, better-than-expected loss experience in GL for 2005 through 2013 and workers\u2019 comp for 2005 and prior and in our Canadian operations, partially offset by a $224 million pretax increase to our asbestos reserves.  The asbestos reserve increased related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense costs for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods.  In bond and specialty insurance, net favorable development of $103 million pretax was concentrated in contract surety and fidelity for 2008 through 2013. Partially driving this favorable development was a reduction in outstanding exposures related to the financial crisis of 2007 and beyond. And in personal insurance, net favorable development of $47 million pretax resulted from homeowners and other liability for 2013 and \u201814 and auto liability for 2012 through \u201914. On a combined stat basis for all of our US subs and excluding A&E, there were no accident years or product lines that had any meaningful unfavorable development this quarter or year to date.  Third-quarter operating cash flows were very strong at $1.8 billion while holding company liquidity, which included the proceeds from our August 25th issuance of $400 million of 4.3% 30-year senior debt ended the quarter at over $2 billion, well above our target level. The proceeds from this debt issuance will be used towards retiring 400 million of debt that is maturing on December 1 of this year.  Our debt to total capital ratio of 23%, or 21.9% adjusted for the retirement of the December 1 maturity was well within its target range and all of our other capital ratios were at or better than their target levels.  Net unrealized gains were approximately $2.2 billion pretax or $1.4 billion after-tax, down from $3 billion and $2 billion respectively at the beginning of the year due to higher rates that were driven by spread widening. Nonetheless book value per share of $79 grew 2% from the beginning of the year and importantly adjusted book value per share of $74.35 which eliminates the impact of unrealized investment gains grew by 5% during this time period. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy we returned $939 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $189 million and common share repurchases of $750 million bringing total capital return to shareholders to almost $2.8 billion year to date.  So Brian is now going to discuss underwriting results in business and international insurance. \nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Business and international insurance had a great quarter with excellent returns and production results. Retention remained at a historically high level, the pricing environment was stable and renewal rate change continued to be positive. New business results were solid although as we have discussed previously, new business flow was somewhat lower than we would like as a result of strong retentions across the industry.  Turning to the financial results. Operating income for the quarter was strong at $546 million while the combined ratio was 92.2%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior year reserve development was 92.5% for the quarter, an improvement of about 2.5 points year-over-year driven primarily by favorable non-catastrophe weather losses.  Looking at the topline, net written premiums for the segment were up a point year-over-year. Domestic business insurance premiums were up 4% driven by changes in the timing and structure of some of our reinsurance treaties in prior quarters which primarily impacted our first party businesses and property lines.  Turning to domestic BI production trends, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our very granular pricing strategy. As we have been saying for some time given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention and accordingly we are very pleased that retention remains at 84% for the third quarter in a row.  In addition, as Alan mentioned, we continue to seek and are able to get price increases where needed. Overall renewal premium change came in at 3% with renewal rate change consistent with the second quarter. New business of $444 million was down somewhat compared to both the prior year and recent quarters reflecting the market dynamics I mentioned earlier.  Looking at each of our individual domestic businesses, the production story is generally consistent with what I just described. I would however bring your attention to other business insurance. As we mentioned last quarter, renewal rate change for this business has turned negative driven by the national property business but even here it\u2019s a very positive overall story with strong returns, retentions in the low 90s and pricing that is slightly negative but stable. Excluding national property, renewal rate change for other business insurance remains positive and down only slightly from the second quarter.  Turning to international, net written premiums were down 19% primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign-exchange. Excluding this impact, international net written premiums were down 6% driven by highly competitive market conditions at Lloyd\u2019s reflective of global economic pressure on the marine and energy lines.  In terms of production, retention remained strong. Renewal premium change turned slightly negative due to about a 1.5 of negative exposure change resulting from the lower line sizes that we've taken in the Lloyd\u2019s business. The rate change component of renewal premium change was a little more than a point positive.  In Canada, renewal premium change continued to be positive. New business was down somewhat quarter over quarter with half of the decline driven by the impact of foreign exchange and the remainder driven by Lloyd\u2019s. So all in, we continue to feel great about the performance across the segment. Returns continue to be attractive and stable and we remain pleased with the granular execution of our strategy.  With that, let me turn it over to Doreen. \nDoreen Spadorcia : Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. Please forgive me for having a scratchy voice and apologize to all of you.  Bond and specialty insurance had another quarter with exceptional financial results. We feel terrific about the fundamentals to drive these results. Disciplined underwriting execution, aggressive management of risk and limits, a continued enhancement of underwriting analytics, strong account and agency relationships and superior claims management.  Operating income for the quarter was $196 million, an increase of almost 20% from the third quarter of 2014, driven by better underlying underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Third-quarter underlying combined ratio of 76.1% for the segment improved by 5.6 points from the prior year. About half of this improvement was due to favorable re-estimation of losses in management liability. Underlying underwriting results remained very strong and well within our target.  As for topline, net written premiums in the aggregate were up slightly from 2014. Surety was 3% higher primarily attributable to middle-market construction accounts and across our management liability businesses, we drove to higher retention of 87% and improved new business from the prior year quarter. So all in all, another great quarter for bond and specialty.  I'll turn now to personal insurance where we once again produced strong underwriting results in both agency auto and agency homeowners and other. We continue to be exceptionally pleased with the growth in our auto book and are very encouraged with the continued momentum we are seeing in homeowners.  For the segment, operating income for the quarter was $241 million, a slight increase from the third quarter of 2014. The underlying combined ratio was strong at 85.2% and benefited from generally benign losses in homeowners. On a run rate basis, the segment continues to perform in line with our long-term return goals.  Looking specifically at agency auto, we continue to be very pleased with the profitable growth we are generating. Topline results remained strong driven by both new business and retention and underlying margins continue to run in line with expectations and in a range we\u2019re comfortable with.  The combined ratio for the quarter was 93.9% and included almost 2.5 points of favorable prior year reserve development. Similar to the last couple of quarters, the favorable prior year reserve development was driven by better-than-expected severity in bodily injury.  The underlying combined ratio of 96.2% was essentially flat to the prior year results. As for loss trend, our view of frequency and severity remain consistent with recent quarters. We are certainly aware that there's a lot of discussion in the industry about trend particularly increasing frequency. While we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period due to things like weather, we currently are not seeing any meaningful change in our overall frequency trend. As always we continue to monitor external data and our own results very closely. But as I said, our view of overall loss trend remains consistent with recent quarters at around 3%.  As for agency auto production, retention of 83% has trended up meaningfully from the beginning of 2014 and remains consistent with recent periods. New business premium of $218 million was more than 30% higher than the third quarter of 2014. We continue to grow policies in force which increased by almost 50,000 during the quarter. Net written premiums increased 10% from the prior year quarter. So again by all measures, great results for auto for the quarter.  Turning to agency homeowners and others, we once again had strong financial results with an underlying combined ratio of 71.5% driven by benign loss experience both in weather and non-weather. This result is somewhat higher than the prior year quarter due to last year\u2019s losses being even more favorable than this year. Run rate margins in this business remain well within our expectation.  As for agency homeowners production, we are very pleased with the progress we're making. New business premiums were up 28% from the prior year quarter and continued to trend favorably while retention remained strong at 84%. Policies in force have leveled off sequentially for the last two quarters and net written premiums when adjusted for the timing and structure of certain reinsurance treaties in prior periods were essentially flat from the prior year quarter.  As we said in previous calls, this is an area of high focus for us and we\u2019re encouraged with the positive results we\u2019re seeing to date. So to sum up personal insurance, another great quarter.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabi. \nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. We are ready to start the Q&A portion please. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJay Cohen : Just a numbers question, I think you said on the call and I missed. There were some current year development I think in the management liability side. Could you just give me that number again? I am sorry I missed that.\nDoreen Spadorcia: On the numbers about 10 million, and that\u2019s generally due to fidelity and crime and I will just tell you we had favorable reserve development in prior accident years and that indicated to us that 2015 will perform better than we originally projected. \nJay Cohen : And then I guess bigger picture on the development which just continues to be such an incredible source of earnings and so resilient. Can you talk maybe broadly, Doreen, about the claims environment, what you\u2019re seeing and what you are not seeing certainly on the liability side? \nDoreen Spadorcia: So you are moving out of surety then at this point.\nJay Cohen : Correct. \nDoreen Spadorcia: Okay. I think we tend to see a pretty stable environment in general liability and there were things that we were thinking might impact that, whether it was people, higher unemployment rate and we might see more liability claims. We thought maybe as people also were in the financial crisis that they thought, we thought jury awards might go up. We didn\u2019t see any of that. So the litigation rates are pretty consistent. We don\u2019t have less or more of that, and it\u2019s performed pretty much I would say better than we thought it would have during the really tough years. For us, in certain lines it\u2019s due to particular things. We have some areas where we have fewer large losses, others we might see the opposite of that but to us, the legal environment has performed pretty well, not what we would have expected politically either. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney.\nLarry Greenberg : I guess before a question, given that Alan is stepping in very shortly. Jay, I just want to congratulate you on an incredible career and legacy and certainly wish you the best of luck in the future. You\u2019ve been \u2013 you\u2019ve really been a leader for Travelers but also the industry, and have created some phenomenal value for your shareholders and taught a lot of people about the value of prudent capital management and you\u2019ve been generous and patient in answering our sometimes inane questions and certainly sharing your industry insights and I just want to thank you personally for that, and I am sure many others on the call feel the same way. \nJay Fishman: Larry, thank you. I\u2019d say over and over, I have been so fortunate to be surrounded, I am sitting at a table here, with what I think is the most thoughtful, smartest, most committed management team I have ever been around. It\u2019s just extremely quite remarkable when you are surrounded by people like this, it just isn\u2019t nearly as hard as it may seem and so thank you. I\u2019d also tell you that one of the great things that\u2019s been fun for this is there\u2019s a handful of you on the call and there\u2019s a couple in the room here but there is a few people that we have been speaking to right from the very beginning, I was doing the arithmetic this morning, I think this is my 56th earnings call and there is a few of you who have been there right from the beginning, and it\u2019s been great fun to work with people over that period of time, just a real great joy actually in watching how people can change their view of the business and how the business has changed. So thank you for the comment, I most appreciate it. Nobody else follow up please with that. That\u2019s the last thank you we will get but Larry, thanks. Go ahead with your question. \nLarry Greenberg : I know you talked a bit about Quantum and maybe it\u2019s nothing more than, it just continues to develop traction in the marketplace. But it seems like the traction is more than certainly I would have expected at this point. And I am just wondering if you could give some more color on what\u2019s really happening, where the rubber meets the road, what\u2019s the feedback from the agents, is it simply that in more time you are getting more traction or anything you could share on that would be helpful for me?\nDoreen Spadorcia: Sure. This is Doreen and good morning. I think that it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s gotten more traction quicker than even we thought and Alan commented on that. We did a lot of work before we designed the product looking at what we thought it needed to be from a pricing standpoint before we started modelling it and looking at, on what expenses needed to take out. Along with that, we have a really, I would say, gifted sales force that is out with agents every day talking about the products. We\u2019ve also introduced some sales marketing toolkits that allows agents to regularly reach out to prospective customers. I think the agents \u2013 I am a little biased in this \u2013 I think the agents really want to do business with us and we gave them a competitive product and a quality product that allow them to do that.  And I think the other really exciting thing about it is that the agents are also seeing as they are picking up a bigger share from the captive and the direct market which is what we hope would happen for them, so they just didn\u2019t see that they were getting a lower commission, so they see that net, net, they are getting into markets that they might not have been successful and they are producing more volume and the feedback has been very good. We meet with them very very often and I think that\u2019s probably \u2013 it\u2019s just worked as we hoped it would. \nLarry Greenberg : Do you think that the issues that some in the industry are having with frequency might be additionally creating some opportunities for you?\nJay Fishman: No, Larry, it\u2019s Jay. I can\u2019t think of a topic that we\u2019ve spent more time trying to understand ourselves and as obviously we are anticipating someone asking, why don\u2019t you think you are experiencing some of the frequency trends that are bizarre, and the truth is that we don\u2019t know. But I\u2019d make the following observations. One is that where you start from is an important assumption. These are \u2013 we are talking about changes in frequency from period to period and so one of the interesting questions is always how good are those original estimates from which you are adjusting, was there a pattern or trend that evidenced itself, later, sooner but so the starting point matters and it can\u2019t be dismissed. The other which I find more than intriguing, there is a tendency to assume, analysts in particular, that the auto insurance customers the equivalent of a monolith there. They are all the same. And we know definitively in the data, that\u2019s just not the case. And we know that for example from our experience of being the GEICO partner for as many years as we have been, the customers that buy directly are on average, now it doesn\u2019t mean that we are on lots of exceptions but on average they are younger, more single, more single cars, more minimum limits, they are a different driver than a higher end older, importantly older driver, the sort of type that was typically been a Travelers customer. So you can speculate and it\u2019s all it is, is it possible that distracted driving is impacting that younger group disproportionately relative to the older drivers. Is it possible that as employment has improved and miles driven increased, that the unemployment improved amongst the younger drivers at a faster rate than older because they have not come down as much, and as a consequence you are seeing \u2013 and this is hypothesis, not a fact, that you are seeing an increase in miles in the group that tends to have a higher rate of frequency. So that\u2019s the best we can offer at the moment. Those two dynamics of who\u2019s the driver and what\u2019s changed in their world and they are quite different and then what\u2019s the starting point from which they are coming.  I think Doreen had it exactly right \u2013 I had a conversation a couple of years ago with an agent and it\u2019s just one. He was using Quantum 2 to do outbound calling to those customers that Travelers had the homeowners on but someone else had the auto. And so he was out there reaching out and saying look, we\u2019ve got a product that\u2019s lower rate than the old Travelers was and you put the two products together and you\u2019ve got the combined product discount, and suddenly that quote for the auto retained remarkably compelling for a meaningful number of customers out there. So sort of one of the surprises was the account rounding that took place around Quantum and that certainly added to the volume. So it started off with really hard management work of reducing costs, tough stuff, tough to execute locally, hard meaning things, and then having a product that could compete with the marketplace that exists today, the core reality of making sure you are not \u2013 you\u2019re relevant in a changing marketplace. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.\nJosh Stirling : So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about pricing and you guys have done a good job of laying out a really interesting phenomenon in the other business insurance line, it\u2019s just a huge difference between property and your overall renewal rate changes and if you sort of observe from 50,000 feet, it looks like most of your renewal rate changes across lot of line to kind of like ending up in 1% or 2% sort of positive and not as much as that was a couple of years ago phenomenon, in other business insurance which I think you will correct me, but I think this is national account and more specialty and wholesale stuff, obviously is declining now for the past couple of quarters and I am wondering if you could sort of talk a little bit about what\u2019s structurally different about this business relative to some of the other sort of more small, bit more commercial personal line things, if it is and if we can sort of understand that and sort of as we get better into forecasting it. But then also perhaps even more technically, is this something that\u2019s really just a phenomenon of the property pressures that are coming from sort of changes in the reinsurance market and then ultimately, almost if you reframe that, is it not as a question of pricing but is a question of margins, would you guys think yourselves as letting property business today at a stable margin but perhaps with less total price?\nJay Fishman: Josh, Alan and I are going to tatting this. First, I\u2019d make the observation that to the extent that capital \u2013 new capital comes into our industry, it comes into those areas that are easiest to put capital to work quickly. So you will often find it in large account business where frequency \u2013 claims frequency is not an issue, you will find it in unregulated \u2013 not as middle market in this \u2013 so capital goes where it can be most easily deployed and the large account property business is a really good example of an area where capital can be committed pretty easily without much infrastructure for regulatory hoops to go through. Now there is something in particular about the national property business and Alan talked about that, but first, we start off with an industry phenomena, to the extent new capital is coming in, that\u2019s an area. \nAlan Schnitzer: Josh, it\u2019s Alan. Let me start with \u2013 we\u2019re just getting a little bit of perspective on your commentary. You said that ex the national property, I think it was zero to 1 and I would say that\u2019s not exactly true. There is a range from a little bit negative on national property to say the auto lines where it\u2019s a challenge from a return perspective and we\u2019re getting rate in excess of loss trend there. So I would just encourage you not to think about the whole book being at a zero or 1 but they are being a range that really corresponds to profitability. Also in terms of what\u2019s in that business, it\u2019s certainly our national property but there is really no casualty in that business at all, it\u2019s national property, it\u2019s boiler, inland, ocean, so just to be clear about what\u2019s in it.  You made the comment about returns but the returns in that national property business are very very attractive. And so I would say that the pressure that we are seeing from price really is coming from two places, there probably is a component of \u2013 that\u2019s an easy place for the incremental capital coming into the business to find a home but also the returns are very very good, and so we continue to have very high retentions and to grow that business. \nJosh Stirling : So if I can ask a final question and obviously the past decade or so of Travelers has been one of capital returns and discipline, and that\u2019s been fantastic for shareholders, to the credit of everybody on the call. But the trade-off from that obviously naturally is that there are some other companies have chosen different approaches where they basically retain earnings and they grow through acquisition or other sources. And I am wondering as you guys look sort of from where you are today as you look forward, think about the next five or 10 years, and think about other companies getting bigger and the importance I presume of Travelers even maintaining its market share as sort of a number one or number two player with all of your agencies. I am wondering how your strategic calculus might change in sort of more of a focus on growth to keep up with [indiscernible] something we should anticipate from Travelers?\nAlan Schnitzer: Josh, let me take that too and let me start by saying and I said these words before, Jay has really managed this through on ensemble cast. So everyone around this table I think feels like we are contributing authors to the strategy that we put in place in that we\u2019ve implemented and executed over the years, and we\u2019re also very very comfortable that what we\u2019ve done has created enormous shareholder value, and so we will continue to be return focused and I would encourage you to all look at the first slide that we put in the webcast every single quarter, quarter in, quarter out, and we spent a lot of time looking at that internally. I would \u2013 if you go back 10 years, and you look at \u2013 and Jay has actually put up the slide before, look at the way we\u2019ve deployed capital, we have grown and we do \u2013 we would certainly rather grow than not grow and we\u2019ve deployed capital where we think we can and grow at attractive returns. So if you look at commercial accounts over the years, or you look at the surety business when the credit environment allowed us to do it, there is all sorts of examples in all different time periods across all of our businesses when we\u2019ve grown, and we will continue to make every effort to do that when we can. We understand that there is a relevance to market share and scale, so we are not indifferent to it, and we will hopefully make the right judgments in balancing the way we manage the business for returns and thinking about the relevance of growth and scale over time. \nJay Fishman: And I would just add that in the context of acquisitions, we\u2019ve been actively engaged with anything that\u2019s transpired, we have looked at, we\u2019ve established views of value and where value can be created, and points at which it can be and if we would have find the transaction, that would fit strategically, that would enable us to either reduce the volatility of our own returns or potentially even improve them and of course, that\u2019s hard being the highest return competitor in the industry, but if we can find that, we\u2019re not uncomfortable moving ahead, where we have done a few transactions in our lives and feel that we have got the skill base to execute and so we will always keep looking. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.\nKai Pan : Thank you. I had to say, Jay, congratulations on a great career ending on such a high note. And then for Alan, I think seeing the announcement, I wonder you must have gave some thoughts on your priorities or where do you see area you can further improve the organization. \nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks for the question, Kai. Certainly been thinking a lot about it and I guess I would go back to where I started with the last question which is we\u2019ve all been managing this and we\u2019ve all been on this trajectory and talked together and we will continue to do that. I mean it\u2019s a really fortunate position at the moment as I said at the opening of the call, not just that I am stepping into terrific results but I am stepping into a very familiar situation. So the management team, the strategy, the board, all of that\u2019s really familiar and that gives me a great opportunity to be thoughtful and very deliberate and to take my time together with the rest of the team as we think about what\u2019s next. So we will do that in due course and this has really given me an opportunity over the last couple of months to spend time with the leadership team to be on the road with our field organizations, to spend time with distribution, so it\u2019s been really a luxury and a privilege and we will take the time to be thoughtful and deliberate about it. \nKai Pan : And follow up question, on your year-over-year improvement on the underlying margin, you said the lower non-cat loss has contributed to that. My understanding is that last year third quarter you have above normal and I don't know if this year's like below normal of non-cat activities and could you quantify that? Just wonder, going forward, we see this year's level would be more normalized non-cat weather events. \nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. I mean as you\u2019ve heard us say on the call before, we\u2019ve always struggled with the concept of what actually is normal, and what we do in our Qs and Ks is \u2013 for weather \u2013 for other things, we do know what is normal. But when it comes to weather, what we are doing in our Qs and Ks is really making comparisons of actual cost in one quarter to actual cost in another, so you do hear us talk about this was more favorable than last year or this was less favorable than last year but to try to quantify in any meaningful way, how that then compares to what\u2019s normal is difficult. What we do try to provide is some color to say that the weather seemed to be fairly benign this quarter. So I think we would say that whatever normal is, is probably a little more expensive than what we saw this quarter but we leave it to you to actually try to dollarize that if you will.\nKai Pan : Well, just year over year comparison, if you look relative basis, like how much that contribute to the 240 basis points?\nJay Benet: Well just look at it a year to year basis, it was primarily a change due to the level of non-cat weather in BI. And that\u2019s what we try to communicate hopefully clearly in the Q and the press release. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse.\nRyan Tunis : My first question, I guess, is just given the 10-year back at 2%, how should we think about the NII run rate on the fixed income portfolio headed into next year as it compares to this year? Also, how should we be thinking about alternative returns headed into fourth quarter with, I guess, probably some lagged odds on PE, especially given energy? \nJay Benet: We try to be very clear in our Q and the outlook as to what\u2019s taking place in the fixed income environment and we don\u2019t try to make predictions of the future interest rates, we more or less look at it on a basis of its today\u2019s rates or to maintain themselves over the next 12 months or so, what\u2019s the likely impact of that on the reinvestment capabilities for assets that are turning over in that timeframe, and based upon that, we\u2019ve made a disclosure in the Q saying that on a quarterly basis we would expect the fixed income NII all things being equal to go down about $25 million to $30 million from where it would have been in the prior year quarter on a comparative basis. And that would be an aftertax number. And that\u2019s frankly consistent with not only what we have been saying but more or less what we have been seeing over the last several years, if you followed what\u2019s taken place in our fixed income portfolio.  As it relates to the non-fixed income portfolio, we do report private equities on a three month lag basis, we report hedge funds on a one month lag basis, so it\u2019s not quite the same in terms of the time differential and from our own forecasting standpoint, we do our best to look forward and try to determine based on equity markets and not just the private equities and hedge funds, but what the real estate markets are doing because that\u2019s a substantial portion of the non-fixed income portfolio and we try to internally estimate what we think fourth quarter and into next quarter returns are going to be but we don\u2019t have a crystal ball, so when people ask me what we think, I try to guide them to look at the past several quarters and draw some conclusions from that as to what kind of trajectory we might be on. If you look, last year versus this year, we did disclose that the repricing of oil worldwide had an impact on our valuations and that\u2019s worked its way through the valuations at this point in time. So other than that, there\u2019s really nothing more I can think of adding to that. \nRyan Tunis : And then I just had two quick number questions on FPI. And my first one, I think, is a follow-up on Jay Cohen's question on the current accident year favorable development and I think Doreen mentioned it was in fidelity and crime. I'm wondering should we think about that as a change in trend that will, all things being equal, also be a tailwind headed into next year? \nDoreen Spadorcia: My answer to that is no. It's really more of a factor of what we've seen in prior accident years and that influencing what we think 2015 would be. So, no, we would not view that as a trend going forward in \u201816. \nRyan Tunis : And then the other one for FPI was just looking at the general admin expenses, they were down about $6 million to $10 million this quarter from where we've seen the run rate. Is this a good run rate going forward or is that one-time, that $93 million? \nDoreen Spadorcia: You're speaking to the intangible that was fully amortized, so that's a one-time event, yes, in the second quarter, is that what we were talking about? \nJay Benet: Yes, if you talk about bond and specialty, the reduction in expenses that you are referring to, there was an intangible that became fully amortized and as a result, that expense now goes away. It continues to go away. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.\nMichael Nannizzi : So just returning to auto for just a second, if I could, I guess not being an operator, trying to see inside the operating lens a little bit, it looks like you're increasing rate and growing as a result of Quantum 2.0. This frequency dynamic has popped up elsewhere that you guys haven't seen. It's still not clear what's underneath that. How do you sort of balance the goal of repositioning auto via Quantum 2.0 and being top three traders and growing at a pace you're comfortable with, but doing that in a changing loss environment and whether that creates the risk of adverse selection? \nJay Fishman: It\u2019s Jay Fishman. Just two or three observations, after he wants to add in. One is if you set higher rate that\u2019s 2.0 versus 1.0, it\u2019s actually a lower rate, in other words the 2.0, again you get all sorts of sales that are different and different underwriting elements but the concept behind 2.0 was across the board a lower priced product than 1.0 was, 1.0 in a comparative rating environment was not nearly competitive enough, 2.0 was designed to be substantially more competitive and that actually has happened. The volume and the product is a function of how it shows up on a technology platform in an agent\u2019s office and in that regard, 2.0 was doing exactly what we had hoped it would. As to the changing loss environment, I am not sure we could look any harder than we looked, for us it hasn\u2019t happened, we could and so we just keep going on. Whether it\u2019s in losses, incurred losses, early indicators of losses, early indicators of activity, there\u2019s just been not a meaningful change and I don\u2019t mean to hammer hard that, because any quarter numbers move a little up or down, all the time. But in looking for something systemic, we just don\u2019t see it here. So those are the \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Doreen, if you want to -- \nDoreen Spadorcia: I would like to add, we do expect when we add new business, that that\u2019s going to perform at least initially at a higher loss ratio and that as that becomes more tenured, it begins to perform in the range of where our tenured business is. So when we have said that everything is in line with our expectations, that\u2019s exactly what we mean, we assume certain things about how the book to new business will perform, and it\u2019s within those garb rails, we just started going through our renewal cycle with the first of the Quantum book, we expect that to even perform at lower levels of loss but within planned expectations. So I agree with Jay, we are not seeing anything that\u2019s systemic in the environment but our view of new business is it gets to the returns over time and we expect it ---\nJay Fishman: I would just add because it\u2019s something we take for granted here, I often find there is confusion. There is no difference in the price between a new account and a renewal account. They are the same and so when Doreen says that a block of new business doesn\u2019t perform as well as once it\u2019s seasoned, it\u2019s not because the rate changes, it\u2019s because the underwriting improves with performance. As you begin to understand the dynamics of each individual account, you can begin to make adjustments all the way from lowering rate where someone has earned it, increasing rate where someone has earned that, or non-renewing where the circumstances warranted, and so the improvement with age is not about a new business penalty, the phrase is often used, it\u2019s really about the unseasoned underwriting performance that occurs in any new block of business in any business and improves with time. \nMichael Nannizzi : I guess my question, when I mentioned rate increase I was looking at the renewal premium change. So I guess what you're saying is that the cost reductions that you made, including the commission reductions, are enough to even make the premium lower in 2.0 versus what it would have been in 1.0 despite the fact that you've got renewal premium change? \nJay Fishman: Exactly right. And so the renewal premium change is positive and obviously some of that, a meaningful amount of that is still Quantum 1 that\u2019s on the books, and where Quantum 2 is, is entirely our new business now but there is a insignificant amount of Quantum 1 that continues its aging, its meaningfully profitable does quite well. Now that obviously will \u2013 the Quantum 1 percentage will go down with time, the Quantum 2 in the portfolio will go up but you\u2019ve got it exactly right. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.\nBrian Meredith : Yes, thanks, two questions here. First one, Doreen, I noticed in the 10-Q that you've changed your outlook for underlying margins in the personal line sub-segment to go from kind of stable going to \u201816 to now I guess smaller margins. What's behind that change? \nDoreen Spadorcia : Brian, that's really as the amount of the Quantum business comes in. \nBrian Meredith : So expectation is still pretty strong growth in Quantum, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s just better than expected.\nGabriella Nawi: Brian, it\u2019s Gabi. Are you talking to all of PI or was that specifically auto \u2013\nBrian Meredith : It\u2019s all personal lines, when you look at all personal lines, make that overall kind of general comment. \nBrian MacLean: It\u2019s a combination of the new business and Quantum is \u2013 Jay and Doreen just talked about, that impact as well as the whole concept of what the weather in that might be.\nBrian Meredith : It\u2019s good solid weather in the third quarter, so kind of looking forward. Okay. That makes sense. The second question, just quickly, and maybe I'm reading too much into this, is looking into your exposure in business insurance, it continued to kind of moderate here, exposure increases. Anything to read into that? \nAlan Schnitzer: No, Brian, it\u2019s Alan. I would say generally reflective of economic conditions. \nBrian Meredith : Okay. So you're seeing economic conditions to may be slowing a little bit? \nAlan Schnitzer: No, we are seeing \u2013 \nJay Fishman: We are trying \u2013 that we are all looking at each other trying to understand what to look, what you are seeing and reacting to. \nBrian Meredith : Just looking at business insurance. If I look at -- you provide the exposure other as a percentage. It's been moderating over the last year. Small business you definitely saw it come down as far as the rate of increase. \nAlan Schnitzer: Pretty small numbers you are looking at. So if you are looking at selective, sequentially it\u2019s 4.9 to 4.1, if you are looking it overall BI, it\u2019s national, it\u2019s something like 2.4 to 2.2, so you\u2019re really talking very small changes in the number that is hard to even calculate with any precision. \nBrian MacLean: And Brian, this is Brian MacLean. Remember that that in the production statistics those are really the underwriter, and the account and the producers estimate of what\u2019s going to happen with the exposures going forward. So it\u2019s a little bit of what gets pushed into the price, then there is also audit premium which is come into the actual premium line which has been a little bit higher. So the actual exposures we are seeing are pretty consistent. \nJay Fishman: And typically as it ages it goes up, but the audit premium gets reflected and so the natural trend is for a customer to under-estimate perspective exposure to save rates and then of course the audit brings it back up and comes in later. So there is a bit of \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it seasonality time of year, but time may associate with it. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.\nJay Gelb : I want to follow up on the M&A environment and I know there's some previous commentary around in what circumstances Travelers might be interested in doing a deal. I wanted to see if you could tailor those comments a bit more towards international versus domestic. \nAlan Schnitzer: Sure, Jay, it\u2019s Alan. I will take that. So we would apply the same kind of thought process and lens to a transaction outside the US as we would to the US, either it\u2019s going to contribute to our mission of improving returns or creating more profit dollars at the same returns or improving volatility. And so we would apply the same lens and go through the same thought process. A transaction outside the United States given our footprint and our scale may be different in that analysis than one would be in the US, so that\u2019s why a $1 billion transaction in Canada for instance was so attractive to us, a $1 billion transaction in the US would certainly less strategic from that perspective. So we will continue to look in our existing and beyond footprint outside the US and we will undertake transactions when they make sense on that basis. \nJay Gelb : Thanks for that. And then on the premium growth for the quarter, gross written premiums up 0.6%, net up 2.6%. So am I right in assuming that it was purchasing less reinsurance was a main driver of the net growth or was there something else there? \nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. In prior quarters, we made some changes to our reinsurance, it was not that we were purchasing less reinsurance but you will recall earlier in the year we talked about changing our cat cover which previously had been on July 1 renewal and we cancelled it as of 12/31. This was the gen cat, cancelled it as of 12/31 last year and on January 1 of this year bought the gen cat cumulative cover. So what you have in this particular quarter is a comparison to a quarter last year where we had a purchase of reinsurance, this year we didn\u2019t have it but the same kind of cover with a different set of limits and different types of aggregation, was done in January 1. All that said, if you want to get a better view of things without looking at the reinsurance, look at year to date information because it washes itself out. There were some other similar types of changes, some in terms of timing, some gone from quota share to excess cover but we really haven\u2019t fundamentally changed the program. \nJay Gelb : So the year to date net written premium growth trends, should it probably be a better indicator?\nJay Benet: Yes.\nJay Fishman: Just one additional thought, again we take for granted you so often -- your acquisition question. We are a small and middle market insurance company, we are a very big one. But we are small and middle market company, we really don\u2019t for substantive reasons aspire to be a globally account casualty underwriter. It\u2019s a different business, it\u2019s not one that we are particularly well suited, we really don\u2019t do it in the US in any meaningful way. And so all these questions about international acquisitions and they are relevant, really we get very local focused, what can we do in a particular geography that we are talking about as opposed to how does it allow us to write global casualty for a fortune 10 company, that\u2019s just not our business, not what we do. So we tend to think of it as quite local and not a global in that sense. \nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie.\nAmit Kumar : Thanks for fitting me in. Just one question, a clarification question. In response to Larry's question I think you mentioned that you're capturing more share in the captive and direct channels. And I was trying to figure out, that's a different shopping experience and why would a captive policyholder be willing to move their auto policy to an independent agent I guess given the lack of a bundling discount? Maybe just explain that a bit more to me. \nDoreen Spadorcia: I mean I don't know exactly why they might switch from one to the other, but they have more choice. If they're with a captive agent they have a product and that's it and if they start shopping around, which we know many more customers are shopping, then they might choose a different distribution channel so that they can have choice. \nJay Fishman: The data is that I'm thinking about is quite dated. I know we have information, of course it's self disclosed where the customer tells us their previous insurer was and I'm going back quite a ways. But it has been -- it has long-standing been predominantly captive companies and other direct companies moving into the independent agent channel disproportionate of our new business rather than -- there's obviously one agent company moving to us, but disproportionately more captive and direct as a percentage of that volume. I haven't looked at that in a couple of years but that's at least what the standard has been. \nDoreen Spadorcia: And we've seen more of it with 2.0 End of Q&A\nGabriella Nawi: Very good. That will conclude our call for today. As always, we are available in investor relations for any follow up questions. Thank you very much and have a great day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask you to please disconnect all lines.

Welcome to the Second Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all your questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 21, 2015. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you Carlos. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our second quarter 2015 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alan Schnitzer, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Business and International Insurance; and Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabi and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. By now you have seen our second quarter results and as you can see from the release it was another strong quarter contributing to a very strong first half of 2015. We reported operating income of $806 million and an operating return on equity of 14.2%, bringing our year-to-date results to $1.6 billion in operating income and a 14.3% operating return on equity. We achieved these results through strong underwriting performance and solid investment performance consistent with our expectations. Most importantly, our long-term average annual operating return on equity now stands at 13.4% well in excess of a cost of capital. This quarter is another brick in the wall of exceptional long-term performance. For all of the recent market commentary about the industry, our experience remains business as usual. At the point of sale, where business is actually conducted that is one agent, one underwriter dealing with one account, things are very stable and just fine. In fact, the commercial insurance marketplace dynamics over the last six months have been remarkably consistent with what we believe would happen and have been far different from the historical conventional wisdom. We continue to believe that the amplitude of the cyclicality that our industry will deal with is much less than would have been the case historically and you can trace that comment back to our Investor Day in May of 2007; and of course while things can change, so far so good. Anticipating that some of you are going to ask us about our take on the recent consolidation in the primary P&C industry, let me make a few observations. No primary P&C insurer has come together over the past two decades through acquisition activity more than we have. We are very good at it and while we haven't announced any mega transactions in a number of years, our shareholders should expect that we are aware of the possibilities and that we are expert at evaluating them. That evaluation comes down to determining the best way to create shareholder value. The return driven strategy that we\u2019ve been executing for nearly a decade now has been highly successful in creating shareholder value. Our total return to shareholders over virtually whatever period you want to pick is at the top of the heap. So, when we evaluate M&A opportunities, which we do all the time, we evaluate them against that standard. As it relates to Chubb, when we consider the modest opportunity to improve the performance of an already high performing company with some of the best people in the industry, the high degree of risk inherent in combining two successful, but very different cultures and the significant impact on returns on equity from the combination of the premium we expect it would be required, as well as all of the required purchase accounting adjustments. The return just didn't measure up. We have the luxury of a plan A that sets a very high bar, a strategy that comes from having highly differentiated competitive advantages and highly successful business franchises with industry-leading product breath. Again, we believe that our total return to shareholders over the recent past, as well as over the longer term speaks for itself and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver superior returns, but we do keep looking at M&A opportunities and when we believe there is a transaction that contributes to creating shareholder value, we will make every effort to complete it. Other than addressing the potential market implications of the transaction, which Brian will do, I hope this addresses your questions on the topic. We really don't expect to comment further on that recently announced transaction. And with that I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jay. As Jay said, we are very pleased with our second quarter results. Operating income of $806 million, up 20% from the prior year quarter, and operating return on equity of 14.2%. Current quarter operating income was driven by a very strong consolidated combined ratio of 90.8%, which was 4.3 points better than the prior year quarter, due to strong underlying underwriting performance, continued net favorable prior year reserve development and lower catastrophe losses, as well as the inclusion of a $32 million benefit from the favorable resolution of prior year tax matters. Operating income was also driven by solid net investment income consistent with our expenses expectations, although lower than in the prior year quarter. Brian, Alan, and Doreen will talk more about underlying results in a little while, so let me say a few words about NII. As was the case in the first quarter, current quarter net investment income is being compared to a very strong quarter last year. Fixed income NII of $431 million after-tax is down $32 million from the prior year quarter, principally due to what we have been saying for many years, securities that had higher book yields have run-off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current interest rate environment. Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation. Non-fixed income NII of $79 million after-tax was down $16 million from the prior year quarter, due to lower returns for energy-related private equity investments. These investments produced negative NII of $9 million after-tax this quarter, which was better than the negative NII of $21 million in the first quarter as compared to positive NII of $11 million after tax in the prior year quarter. As I mentioned, earnings continues to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development, which amounted to $207 million pre-tax this quarter, up $24 million from the prior year quarter. In business and international insurance net favorable development of $103 million pretax resulted from better than expected loss experience in several different product lines, including workers comp for accident years 2006 and prior, GL for 2008 through 2013, Lloyd\u2019s in Canada and property in both CMP and the property product line for more recent accident years, partially offset by a $47 million after-tax versus $72 million pretax increase to environmental reserves. In bond and specialty insurance, net favorable development of $40 million pretax resulted from better than expected loss experience in contract surety for 2010 through 2013. And in personal insurance, net favorable development of $64 million pretax resulted from better than expected loss experience in homeowners and other liability for 2011 through 2014; and for non-CAT weather-related losses for 2014, as well as better than expected loss experience in auto liability for 2012 through 2014. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs there were no accident years or product lines that had any meaningful unfavorable development this quarter or year to date. Second quarter operating cash flows were also strong at $676 million, up $51 million from the prior year quarter, while holding company liquidity ended the quarter at over $1.7 billion and all of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.1 billion pretax or $1.4 billion after tax, down from $3 billion and $2 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, due to the recent rise in interest rates causing book value per share at $77.51 to grow by only 1% from the beginning of the year. Importantly, adjusted book value per share of $73.09, which eliminates the impact of unrealized investment gains grew by 3% during this time period. We continue to generate much more capital than we needed to support our business and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned almost $1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $194 million and common share repurchases of $801 million bringing total capital returned to shareholders to almost $1.85 billion year-to-date. Before turning the microphone over to Brian there is one more topic I would like to cover, our cat reinsurance coverage. As you may recall, effective January 1 of this year, we significantly increased the attachment point of our Gen CAT reinsurance by replacing our previous Gen CAT treaties, the $400 million CAT aggregate of excess of loss treaty, which expired as scheduled on December 31 and the $400 million Gen CAT treaty, which our reinsurers agreed to terminate early as of that date with the new aggregate ex-OL treaty that provides coverage for both single events and accumulation of losses from multiple events. $1.5 billion of coverage part of $2 billion, excess of $3 billion, after $100 million deductible per occurrence. By doing this, we retain the same broad pharaoh and geographic coverage as the former Gen CAT and ex-OL treaties, while positioning the coverage layer to provide a significant buffer between earnings and capital. During the second quarter, we repositioned our Northeast specific cat coverage, lowering its attachment point from about $2 billion, while maintaining its maximum recovery. Our current combination of two Northeast CAT bonds and the new Northeast Gen CAT reinsurance treaty attaches at $1.058 billion of covered losses and provides $1.4 billion of coverage through $3.1 billion, the point at which the Gen CAT aggregate ex-OL treaty takes over. Taken collectively, we increased our potential reinsurance recoveries and repositioned the attachment points to more closely align with the risks in our business, while spending essentially the same amount. A more complete description of our captains reinsurance coverage, including a description of new earthquake and international coverage\u2019s is included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today as well as in our 2014 10-K. So with that now let me turn the mic over to Brian who is going to speak about underwriting results.\nBrian MacLean: Thank you, Jay. Alan and Doreen will go over the segment details, but before they do I want to make a few comments about the macro environment. Echoing Jay's comments we're certainly very pleased with our results, both in the quarter and for the first half of 2015. We are at a 90% combined ratio year-to-date, very strong retention, stable renewal price increases and no major surprises in our loss trend. In fact, results like this or what we spend our carriers hoping to achieve and here we are, but importantly we didn't get here by accident. We did it with the relentless and consistent execution on our strategies and by investing in and developing a broad rapid products and services and other meaningful sustainable competitive advantages in the markets we serve. But while we feel great and want to talk about how well we\u2019re positioned, I suspect many of you are also interested in our thoughts on the impact that the ACE/Chubb transaction may have on the marketplace. So let me share a few thoughts on that. First, we already compete against these two companies more so Chubb than ACE given our business and geographic focus and we don\u2019t anticipate a lot of difference in competing against them as a single entity. Any company that is large enough can disrupt the market if it\u2019s willing to accept meaningfully lower returns over time, but both ACE and Chubb were probably large enough to have done that before the transaction, so we don\u2019t see that risk being any different going forward. Second, we have great long-term and trusted relationships with our important broker and agent partners and we don\u2019t see that being disrupted. We remain a leading independent agency commercial insurer in our principal market, the United States. And in Personal lines, we are the leading independent agency market in the Homeowners business and we don\u2019t generally compete in the high-end home product, which is Chubb\u2019s primary personal line focus. Third, having completed a number of large scale transactions ourselves, we know that there inevitably will be disruption and dislocation of people and business. This will likely create near- and medium-term opportunities and it\u2019s possible we will benefit from these. Obviously, only time will tell what the long-term impact maybe. But as I said before, we feel great about Travelers. We remain very pleased with how our business is performing and more importantly how well we are positioned for opportunities in this marketplace going forward. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I\u2019m sure that many of you have seen that recently we made some senior level organizational changes and I want to recognize a few of those folks on their new responsibility. Greg Toczydlowski, who\u2019s done a fabulous job managing our personal insurance business, is moving over to business insurance to oversee our small commercial operation as well as take on responsibilities for technology, operations, and business platforms across all of Business Insurance. Michael Klein, who had been managing our middle market commercial business, will take Greg\u2019s spot in Personal. Michael has had a broad range of experiences in his 25-plus years with the company and his management skills, knowledge of analytics in our products make him a perfectly suited to run the personal business. Marc Schmittlein, who for the last 12 years has led our small commercial business, will take on the role of coordinating our cyber insurance efforts across our business. We see cyber coverage as an important opportunity in the marketplace. Scott Higgins will assume leadership of our middle market commercial business and Darren Hinshaw [ph] has been appointed Chief Operating Officer of Personal Insurance. We are thrilled that we have this depth of management talent and the collaborative culture in which great people can thrive. After all, in this industry when we talk about competitive advantages, we start with talent and culture and to succeed you need both of them. With that, let me turn it over to Alan to cover the Business Insurance and International segment.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Brian, and good morning. We delivered another quarter of strong performance in business and international insurance with operating income of $543 million. Our underlying combine ratio was relatively consistent with the prior year quarter at 93.1% reflecting attractive and stable product returns. In terms of the top line, net written premiums decreased by a little over 1% from the prior year quarter. This was driven by our international business where net written premiums were down 15% primarily as a result of the adverse impact of foreign exchange. Domestic business insurance net written premiums were up about a 0.5. In terms of our domestic production results, as Jay said, we remain pleased with the stability of the market as evidenced by historically high retention and positive rate change. We\u2019ve commented for some time now, that this pricing has improved more of our portfolio is generating attractive returns and our objective has been to retain more of that business. We\u2019ve now posted a very strong 84% retention for two consecutive quarters. As you can see on slide 9, excluding the impact of our large account property business, which I will get back to in a minute, positive renewal rate change and domestic BI was unchanged from the first quarter. Our ability to deliver these results comes from the excellent execution by our field organization of our very granular account by account and class by class strategy. Turning to slide 10 in the webcast, in select retention hit a 6 year high, while renewal premium change moderated only slightly. In middle market, we posted a very strong retention and steady sequential renewal premium change. Notably within renewal premium change, renewal rate change has been remarkably steady over the past five months. In terms of retention, we are retaining around 90% of our best performing business, while achieving renewal rate gains in excess of loss trend on our worst performing business. New business and middle market was down year-over-year. While we like the marketplace stability, one consequence of the stable market is the submission flow was down somewhat. In other domestic business insurance, while renewal rate change turned negative this quarter as you can see on slide 12 of the webcast, the decrease is driven by national property, our large account property business. Excluding the impact of national property, renewal rate change in other domestic BI would have been a positive 1.9%. To put it in context, national property accounts were about 25% of the net written premium and other domestic BI were only about 5% of the net written premium in this segment. Even with the rate change in national property, current pricing levels and returns in that business are attractive and accordingly, we have successfully driven retention to near record levels. In our international business, retention continues to be strong and steady at 82% while renewal premium change of 1.5% was consistent with last quarter. New business is down over the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of disciplined underwriting and a competitive environment in Lloyd\u2019s and the impact of foreign exchange rates. To sum it up, we are pleased with the stability in the marketplace and the results we delivered in the quarter and with the depth and breadth of our talent particularly in the field, our deep analytical capabilities and our market leading products and services, we are well positioned to continue to deliver superior results. And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Bond and speciality insurance had another strong quarter with exceptional financial returns. For the quarter, operating income was $151 million, a reduction from the second quarter of 2014 driven by a lower level of net favourable prior year reserve development partially offset by a favourable resolution of prior year tax matters. Underlying underwriting results remain very strong and well within our target. As for top line, net written premiums were generally flat to 2014. Across our management liability businesses, retention and new business premiums picked up modestly while renewal premium change was down slightly. So, great results for this segment. I will now turn to personal insurance where we also had another terrific quarter with strong underwriting results in both agency auto and agency homeowners and other. For this segment, operating income for the quarter was $174 million, up significantly from the second quarter of 2014 due primarily to lower cat and non-cat weather and higher net favourable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio improved by more than a point from the prior year quarter, driven by favourable non-cat weather. We continue to feel great about the margins in this segment. Looking at agency auto, we once again delivered strong top and bottom line results for the quarter and continue to be very pleased with the performance of this business. The 96.5% combined ratio for the quarter included 2.5 points of favourable prior year reserve development, which was driven by better than expected severity in bodily injury. The underlying combined ratio of 96.9% continues to run in a range we are comfortable with, given current market condition. This result was up modestly from the prior year quarter due to a variety of small items including non-cat weather, which although materially favourable for homeowners, was slightly adverse year-over-year for auto. Our loss trends remain consistent with recent quarters. Production results also continued to be strong driven by Quantum Auto 2.0 where we are now coming up on two years since the start of the roll out. New business premium was 37% higher than the second quarter of 2014 and we continue to grow policies in force, which increased more than 35,000 during the quarter. Net written premiums increased 7% from the prior year quarter. So, by all measures, great results for auto for the quarter. Turning to agency homeowners and other, we once again delivered strong financial results with an underlying combined ratio of 77.5%, a 4 point improvement from the prior year quarter driven by relatively benign non-cat weather. Margins in this business remain well within our return expectations. As for agency homeowners production, we are very pleased with the progress we\u2019re making. New business premiums were up 33% from the prior year quarter and continued to trend favorably, while retention remained strong. Policies in force have leveled off and net written premiums are essentially flat from the prior year so the book has stabilized. As we have said in prior quarters, this is an area of high focus for growth and we\u2019re encouraged with the positive results we\u2019re seeing. So to sum up, personal insurance another great quarter; and with that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Gabi.\nA - Gabriella Nawi: Thank you. We\u2019ll now take questions please. [Operator Instructions] Carlos, go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nRandy Minor: Hi, great, thank you very much. So Travelers has followed the kind of the moderation in price decreases we've seen across commercial lines and so I was wondering if we could go a little more into detail and what you\u2019re seeing out there, what's causing that headline pricing number to moderate more as it approaches the zero level?\nAlan Schnitzer: Randy it's Alan's Schnitzer, I\u2019ll take that. You guys focus on the headline rate number a lot more than we do. We\u2019re looking at this on an account by account basis and it will build up to whatever builds up to and at least in our performance I think what you see is, as more of our business is reaching rate adequacy our objective is to keep that business not to continue to necessarily get price on it. So, it really is a function of more of that business going over four years of rate increases to rate adequate for us and what you see in the headline number is just the aggregation of all those individual transactions.\nRandy Minor: But is there, I know we focus on that number, but it is important for us, is there more, kind of more consistency or more rational behavior in the environment is there less, I mean I know Travelers is a big company and there is a lot going on, like property, for instance. But is there kind of less bad behavior out there in the most recent quarter compared to what we saw later last year?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, so Randy, I didn't mean to suggest that the number is not important, I\u2019m just suggesting we focus on it differently than you do because we\u2019re executing really on a very, very granular basis and we\u2019re looking at it one account at a time, but to get back to your other question I think when we talk about the market ourselves among ourselves and we talk to our field organization, we would say that by and large it does appear to be a pretty rational marketplace and it appears that there is a real return focus in the industry.\nJay Fishman: This is Jay Fishman. I think it\u2019s absolutely right. And Brian spoke about it as well it\u2019s - any one company if it\u2019s large enough and is willing to accept subpar returns over time can affect the marketplace from a pricing perspective, that\u2019s not been the case, it\u2019s not been the case for a long time. Now why that is, I actually think a lot of it is data and analytics and the fact that people actually understand their returns better than they did 10 years ago. No one would open knowingly say, well I\u2019m pricing this to produce subpar returns, I think that happened to some extent accidentally, not intentionally and so I think the data is different than the business, it\u2019s been different for some time. I get asked all the time, are we pleased or not that other people seem to be getting good at it? I think it is great. I think the more people understand the cost of goods sold in our business and the risks associated with it, the more we look like a normal financial services business and less of one that\u2019s operating in the dark. So, I think that we may have led this and I\u2019m sure we did, but the fact is that you see it in virtually everyone\u2019s reporting, greater reliance on analytics and return focus and that's I think what's causing it. We\u2019re allowing it to happen perhaps is a better expression.\nAlan Schnitzer: And Randy the other thing I would point you to is the rate at which insurance companies by and large are returning capital to shareholders and if you look at that trend over long period of time, I think you will see a lot more capital being returned. So, to the extent capital can't be deployed at acceptable returns, I think you see a trend toward getting it back.\nRandy Minor: All right. Thank you very much.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.\nKai Pan: Good morning, thank you. The first question regarding to the full -- the pricing trend. Just wonder if that -- if the trend stabilized, will we see the margin also stabilizing at this level or there could potentially be some margin pressure relatively to the loss cost or inside?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes Kai, it\u2019s Alan, let me take that as well. And I guess it depends on how you look at it. So let's just say rates are point or point and a half at the moment. We've said that loss trend is running at about four, so if you are looking on a very narrow basis at the relationship of those two things maybe you\u2019d say that rate isn't covering loss trend, but there is obviously a lot more in margin. So, you\u2019ve got volume mix, claims handling practices, underwriting initiatives, expenses whether all those things come through the margin every quarter and there is always going to be moments in those things. So, I would say that were rate and loss trend are sort of too close to call where margins are going to drift over time, given the current relationships of those two things.\nKai Pan: So, our non-CAT weather benefits the quarter overall?\nAlan Schnitzer: Non-CAT weather in, weather overall in the quarter compared to the prior year was favorable if you take CATs and small weather. Small weather was about the same year-over-year.\nKai Pan: Okay, great. A follow-up question.\nAlan Schnitzer: You know what, Kai I am sorry about that. I was looking at the wrong number. There was a benefit to quarter and small weather.\nKai Pan: Great. Follow up question on management succession, Jay you have been running the firm fabulously well like for the past 10 years and you also like some management change recently show you have a deep bench there. I just wonder what is the board consideration about manage succession planning?\nJay Fishman: Actually thank you for asking that question. I will actually answer it a little bit broader, just in case anybody really wants to, but it is uncomfortable because it is a perfectly reasonable question given our announcement a year ago about my health status, to ask about what's going on. So first I would observe that we\u2019ve been I would say as open as anyone can be about my own personal health status. And more importantly, perhaps most importantly I\u2019ve kept my partners and the Board of Directors here completely price knowledgeable, as I've done along in that process. I am very much on the job and fully engaged and at least from my own perspective there is no decline in my cognitive scale, may be others around here might disagree, but I don't feel I'm struggling in that regard. Now we've always taken succession planning seriously whether it was five years ago, when I was 57, if I did the math correctly, or now that I'm going to be 63 and dealing with health issue, it\u2019s no different, we take it as seriously now as we did then, and there is absolutely a plan in place, with certainty I will tell you that and for the moment all good and when we have more to say about succession and given the fact that I'm going to be 63, we will have more to say, we're going to say it and until then I\u2019m on the job and we\u2019re doing just fine.\nKai Pan: Great, well thank you so much.\nJay Fishman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs, please go ahead.\nMichael Nannizzi: Thank you. I guess one question maybe for both Jay Fishman and Jay Benet on the capital generation, capital deployment timing, recently you been deploying more cash than you\u2019ve generated when we look at operating cash flows and the deduction for dividends and buybacks, is that something that you expect to continue to do just given capital efficiency that you're generating and you know when we think about potential M&A or capacity for M&A or maybe a desire to do something to bolt something on, does that pattern need to change to be able to create more of a base to start from? Thanks.\nJay Fishman: We\u2019re both to answer that because I think there are parts of it that are relevant to both of us. I just couldn't have imagined accumulating cash over the last 10 years hoping that there would be an acquisition opportunity that would make that judgment with hindsight look thoughtful. You all would have been highly critical, I suspect of that in our returns would have been considerably lower and one of the things I learned from working with Sandy for as long as I did is that if a transaction makes sense you get it financed, and that treating your shareholders\u2019 money like it\u2019s a bank account to be \u2013 to just sit on is really not appropriate. So I think we\u2019ve done exactly the right thing and when there is a transaction that we want to do, we will do it. We will go ahead and we will do it. So I will let Jay speak more to the capital and it\u2019s timing, but philosophically we\u2019ve done exactly what we wanted to do.\nJay Benet: And Jay said the keyword timing. In any quarter, our share repurchases is going to be based upon what our views of prior capital build up has been. So just because in one quarter or series of quarters, it\u2019s higher than what the earnings look like is really on an indication of a fundamental change in philosophy. It\u2019s still being driven by the creation of operating income and, therefore, capital in excess of what\u2019s need to support our business. And we will look for opportunities to organically grow our business, which will require capital. There may be, as Jay said, some M&A activity that requires capital like we did in Brazil or with Dominion. But overall, it\u2019s a matter of finding those opportunities that provide the appropriate returns and where we don\u2019t find those opportunities, we return the excess capital on a real-time basis to you.\nMichael Nannizzi: Thanks. And then maybe just a quick one for Doreen in personal lines. Any frequency trend as a result of kind of employment or other environmental factors that you saw in 2Q or departure from trends so far this year? And thank you Jay and Jay for those answers.\nDoreen Spadorcia: We\u2019ve obviously been paying very close attention to miles driven and unemployment, which we\u2019ve heard others speak about. But I will tell you at this point, our trend is 3%, which it has been historically, so we are not seeing anything out of the ordinary. There has been a little bit of non-cat weather, but that was just in Q1, but our trend remains consistent.\nMichael Nannizzi: Great. Thank you so much.\nDoreen Spadorcia: You know what, I\u2019m sorry, I just wanted to correct. 3% is our trend overall, that includes frequency and severity. That\u2019s what I meant, but Gaby wanted to make sure.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJay Gelb: Thank you. My first question is just a follow-up on the potential for industry consolidation. The last major deal I believe that Travelers had completed was the St. Paul merger around 12 years ago. And I just want to clarify that, if there\u2019s a large deal that presents itself strategically and financially, that Travelers feel is the right deal to do that, the company would be willing to issue stock for that?\nJay Fishman: Yes, no question about it. I would observe by the way that your \u2013 Dominion was for most people, that would be considered a not insignificant transaction on its own, but I grant you that the kind of mega transaction dates back to that one, yes.\nJay Gelb: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, with regard to the \u2013 I know you \u2013 I don't want to dig in too much on the commentary on Chubb. But I just wanted to clarify, did Travelers get a chance to look at the Chubb deal before ACE announced the transaction?\nJay Fishman: I said everything on the transaction I think that\u2019s appropriate for me to say.\nJay Gelb: Fair enough. And then finally, the third quarter annual asbestos review, it's probably in process. Any updates on that front?\nBrian MacLean: No updates at this point. We do continually look at asbestos on a quarterly basis. We have the annual in depth claim review that takes place and we expect to complete that in the third quarter.\nJay Gelb: Okay. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nJosh Stirling: Good morning, and thank you for taking the call. So I wanted to talk a little bit about, not so much ACE and Chubb, about the company and so on and so forth per se, but just generally as the market evolves if there\u2019s going to be more concentration? In the independent agency market, there is maybe some more competition that comes from people that have to drive growth to pay for the revenue synergies that they promised, how does that play out? You obviously have a bunch of claims capabilities and pricing capabilities, and you\u2019re sort of number one and number two with most of our agents. But is there going to be sort of a strategic need to get larger, to drive either greater market power or expense leverage or something like that? Or should we just imagine that this is \u2013 there is a lot of different companies, and you\u2019re going to basically stick to your knitting, looking at one policy at time, and sort of keep doing what you\u2019re doing?\nJay Fishman: Yeah, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. I answered the question at the end there. That\u2019s exactly right. We are going to keep doing what we are doing. There isn\u2019t anything that we expect will happen or contemplate will happen that would require any kind of change in our own strategy. Now having said that, lots of companies that are out there, not just new ones, but old ones too and each of them operate everyday and present their offerings to agents and their services and their people, and we compete against all of them. And we expect we are going to continue to compete against all of them. And I\u2019d really don\u2019t anticipate any change. The funny thing as I reflect on it often about taking a lower price to drive revenue synergies is that the arithmetic doesn\u2019t really work. If you cut your rate, your premiums go down. You want to raise premiums, you got to do a whole lot more new business at lower levels of profit, just to get back to where you were. So the simple arithmetic of taking a lower rate on a large book in the hope of driving revenue synergies is often a fool\u2019s errand. Now it isn\u2019t always. Some people can do perhaps elegantly, but there haven\u2019t been too many of them. So I suspect that the market will continue to think about interest rates and weather and the cost of capital and all of it seems to be incorporating as it prices its product with an unknown cost of goods sold. I don\u2019t expect a lot of change. Could be dead wrong, but that\u2019s one person\u2019s view.\nJosh Stirling: That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s helpful. If I could honestly ask a sort of similar question, but at the other end of the spectrum? So six months or so ago, one of your big mono line competitors in the auto side, announced a deal to get into the homeowners\u2019 insurance business. Obviously it\u2019s probably not material yet, maybe won\u2019t be for some time. But this is a big business for you guys, the source of margins, and it\u2019s been a place you\u2019ve really invested to build a franchise. But I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s some risk here? Either from losing some of the value you have with agents, from having the bundled offering and the market share that you do. Or I believe you guys distribute a lot with some other \u2013 or at least one or two other direct insurance companies, and I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a risk that you would lose some of the business, if it becomes sort of popular to bring the homeowners business back in-house?\nDoreen Spadorcia: This is Doreen. I\u2019ll answer your question. We\u2019ve, as we\u2019ve stated before, our business strategy is based on account business and overall service to consumers. To the extent that a certain company has acquired a homeowners\u2019 capability, we think that\u2019s probably a good thing for them. If we were looking at it, it\u2019s smart, but it\u2019s a start-up. It\u2019s very small. And I think you heard Brian\u2019s or Jay\u2019s points in the beginning that we\u2019re the number one homeowners franchise with independent agents. We don\u2019t take that for granted. We\u2019re going to be very, very aggressive about maintaining that position. And so, while I think it\u2019s an interesting twist to things, I think it more validates what our view is about the importance of the product to the customer.\nJay Fishman: I would add one other \u2013 this is Jay Fishman. I would add one other point. We really like the homeowners business.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Yeah.\nJay Fishman: We really do. We are not in it reluctantly, quite the contrary. The record that we\u2019ve posted there is really remarkable. I think if you look over the past now even 11 and 12 years, it was one year we had a combined ratio in the homeowners business in excess of 100 and that was actually 2011. It was Tuscaloosa, and it was Joplin, and it was Irene. Other than that, we\u2019ve been sub-400 every year and \u2013 so we\u2019re in it because we like it and we think we are real good at it. So, it\u2019s okay, we will keep going.\nJosh Stirling: Okay. Thanks, guys. They\u2019re probably 10 years late. So we\u2019ll check back in 5.\nJay Fishman: It\u2019s okay, we were 10 years late on direct. So we\u2019ll trade them.\nJosh Stirling: That\u2019s fair. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is just for Jay. I guess Travelers has probably more experience than any other company in integrating large companies or large P&C companies over the last two decades, you know it is obviously a dealer specific question, but in what ways do you see it easier or harder to integrate a large company today versus 8, 10 years ago either from cost save standpoint revenue synergy any of that type of stuff? [Audio Gap]\nJay Fishman: These are hard to do, they are hard from the human side of the news. People get concerned about their jobs, their families, their positions all legitimate concerns and lots of really good talented people and it\u2019s hard, the people side of this is a very, very hard thing to do; and that\u2019s kind of my experience. I never rely too much on revenue synergies, I used to worry a lot about revenue loss. Our goal was to keep it intact, if we thought if we could keep it intact we were actually doing pretty good given some of the pressures that emerge from it. So, synergies I have absolutely no idea, yes it\u2019s hard tough job.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.\nJay Cohen: Yes. A couple of questions. First is will you, in the 10-Q you gave an outlook for 2016 March, I think that\u2019s the first time you did that in the business, kind of the underlying margins and you are suggesting relative stability as you go into 2016, I guess to read into that is a fair to assume you believe pricing will remain relatively stable through at least the first half of next year?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes Jay, it\u2019s Alan. So embedded in that outlook in 2016 we think there will be some improvements in the large losses and the weather. But in terms of pricing, I direct your attention to another part of that outlook where we do talk about renewal premium change. We don't get into a distinction between exposure and price, but we do give you a sense there of relative stability in renewal premium change.\nJay Cohen: That's great. And then maybe a question for Jay Benet, you talk about potential M&A and then you mentioned you will be able to finance it not worry about excess capital and holding on to it, but what kind of leveraged do you think you could deploy if it was a good solid acquisition?\nJay Benet: We operate at the holding company with leverage target of somewhere in the 15% to 25% range, relative to total capital and we\u2019re running a little under 22% at this point in time. That\u2019s consistent with our ratings objective, it\u2019s consistent with the discussions we have with the rating agencies, you know if there was some transaction that caused it to go to the higher end of that target range, I would think the rating agencies would be very comfortable with that, I think, you know if you could probably go a higher, if you had plans to bring it down over a period of time, you know there is some flexibility there, but that\u2019s the general characteristic of a leverage ratio that we think of.\nJay Fishman: I actually agree and I think that you could, of course Jay\u2019s smiling. I was just going to make a little bit different point, I think you can take it somewhat above the limit recognizing that you would not be in the share buyback position for some time, it would not make sense to be out issuing shares and then turn around very quickly and be buying back doesn't make a lot of sense. So, redirection cash flows gives you some leveraged capacity as well.\nJay Cohen: Got it. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney. Please go ahead.\nLarry Greenberg: Hi good morning. Thank you. Just a little bit of clarity on the net non-cat weather comments specifically in personal alliance, the year ago non-cat weather if my memory serves me was a bit worse than what you might characterize as normal, so recognizing that this quarter was better than a year ago, was it better than what you would characterize as normal?\nDoreen Spadorcia: I think for homeowners it was, for auto it was slightly negative.\nJay Fishman: So, aggregate for this segment.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Net positive, but it was a little different by line.\nLarry Greenberg: Okay thanks. And then just to talk a little bit about the expense ratios, and I might be microscoping things a little bit too much here, but it looks like in business and personal lines, the expense ratio has been trending a little bit higher this year, I know the year ago first quarter had some unusual worker's comp stuff in it, so that was exaggerated, but adjusted for everything it looks like expense ratios are marginally higher and I guess, I would have thought with Quantum and personal lines and maybe the continued integration of Dominion on business and international that that expense ratios might be trending down at this point, so just wondering if there is any thoughts on that?\nBrian MacLean: Larry this is Brian. It is really two different stories, but whilst [ph] Alan do the BI piece and then \u2013 that segment and Doreen can touch on professional lines.\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure, let me start with that in the quarter expenses did tick up a little bit and I would caution you that every quarter there is going to be things that sort of come and go. In the expense line this quarter we had a little bit of expenses, I mean technology expenses running through, but I think what I would really point you to is the expense ratio for the first half of the year, if you are looking for what we would consider broadly speaking is sort of a reasonable run rate number, but again I\u2019d put a quarter around that because there is always going to be things that come and go.\nDoreen Spadorcia: And I will move to PI for a minute. So you know that we set out to take $140 million of expense out, so that we could price Quantum 2.0 at a competitive level and that was made up of separate pieces, so you won't see everything in the expense line. We had about a third of that from ULAE [ph] a third from commissions and then the third other third was our own operating expense. And I think what we're seeing with some of that not reducing is that we had a higher level of growth in a good way then we had planned, so your acquisition expenses in terms of report ordering and inspections all of that really are upfront cost and we also are having such a good property here that we contributed to our contingent commission. So, I think they are all explainable and I will just say that the things that we've done have allowed us to compete from a new product perspective. So, and just to reiterate, I think we did a reconciliation for you at the end of \u2013 for the fourth quarter and we did achieve the $140 million in savings. It\u2019s just those others\u2026\nJay Fishman: Shows up in the loss.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Right.\nJay Fishman: In the loss ratio, not the expense ratio.\nDoreen Spadorcia: A big part of it and some was in property and some was in auto.\nLarry Greenberg: Okay, great. Thanks. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. So one question here. In looking at your kind of underlying combined ratios, business insurance area, they're pretty profitable, loss cost pretty benign right now, rate activity pretty consistent. I am just curious, why aren't we seeing market share gains out of the Travelers at this point, and what are you doing potentially to pick up some market share? I think that this would be a perfect time to do that, and maybe not so much with price, but maybe with risk appetite as well?\nJay Fishman: Yeah. It\u2019s Jay Fishman. I will turn it over to Alan in a second. But your last line there, I think is right on. We just don\u2019t think that on the margin you can grow market share by trying to fine tune a modest reduction in price. You don\u2019t have a price lift and its individual underwriters with individual agents and individual accounts. And they bring with them every day a philosophy of perspective and we can\u2019t say to them want you to cut price by a 0.5. They wouldn\u2019t understand a 0.5 from what? It wouldn\u2019t make sense. And so the notion of fine tuning pricing to achieve market share gains is an illusion. It just \u2013 we don\u2019t know how to do and I\u2019m not sure anybody else does either. Now if someone is willing to accept materially lower returns, not only on new benign renewal because it will bleed over. You will begin getting exceptionally aggressive on new business and what you find is that agents will get exceptionally anxious about their old renewal books. And so you can do that, but it will have a really meaningful impact on profitability and we\u2019ve seen plenty of companies do that, grow revenues with meaningfully declining profitability, not a \u2013 we don\u2019t think a successful strategy. So we focus on product, we focus on people, we focus on technology, we focus on doing making it easier to do business with agents, as growing our market share. So if you look at our middle market business over the last and I\u2019m really going from memory here \u2013 over the last I think 10 years, middle market went from $2.2 billion in premium to $3.2 billion in premium. That\u2019s a substantial growth in that segment as we did that. Now, we\u2019ve had other segments that have shrunk and they\u2019ve shrunk to some extent intentionally. When we hit the financial crisis, we took a very hard look at our surety business and our management liability businesses and we had some because we didn\u2019t do everything perfect. I think about our attempt to raise rates in Quantum, pre-Quantum 2.0. So it\u2019s a very granular analysis and I\u2019ll actually direct you to the Investor Day presentation that we did I\u2019m going to say two years ago, where we presented an analysis of individual lines of business and how they had grown and others and how they had shrunk. So we are always interested in growing. We are just interested in growing in ways that are intelligent and actually create value overtime and we work at that relentlessly. Alan, if you want to chime in.\nAlan Schnitzer: Not much to add. I guess I would point to things like moving Marc Schmittlein to over to take on the cyber project. That\u2019s an example of something we see as a real potential opportunity and when we find those opportunities and we do spent a lot of time looking for and we will make every effort to try to make hay out of it.\nBrian Meredith: Right. I guess, maybe where I was trying to go with this, Jay, a little bit is, is it at this point where we are in the cycle, and pricing stuff an appropriate time to maybe dip down in the E&S markets, in areas that maybe are on the borderline standard E&S, and try to get a little bit more risk appetite from that perspective, given where loss trend is right now?\nJay Fishman: So first, Fred is encouraging me to say, I said middle market in numbers I gave you which are actually commercial accounts. So that $2.2 billion to $3.2 billion, so the record is correct in that regard. The notion of the E&S market as a separate distinguished risk pool is just something that we struggle with a little bit. We are always trying to push our risk appetite out. I think about what Marc Schmittlein did in Select as he broadened the profile of the business that we were trying to do. I think about what \u2013 I think about what we also did in commercial accounts as we broadened out the programs and products there. E&S market, what Alan speak to that more directly, but it\u2019s always trying to push our risk profile comfortably and when you don\u2019t push it comfortably, you don\u2019t bring knowledge, you get bad results. Right?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, I agree, we will push ourselves on a risk profile, but we will be steadfast on their return focus. So whether it\u2019s E&S or anything else, we are certainly looking for the opportunities.\nBrian Meredith: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay. And this will be our last question please.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nCharles Sebaski: Good morning. Thank you. First question is on the personal business and the Quantum 2.0. Can you give us any additional color on how much of the book now has kind of filtered through from Quantum 2.0, and what effect that could have as it kind of expands through going forward?\nDoreen Spadorcia: This is Doreen, and I'll tell you there's certain things we don't normally disclose. But I will tell you, and we've said this in the past, that over 90% of our new business is now coming from Quantum 2.0. Since inception, we've now got a pretty big chunk of premium, and we\u2019ve got enough earned premium that we think there's enough credibility for us to really look at the performance of the business. And I'll tell you that it's right within our expectations of how we thought it was going to perform.\nJay Fishman: And the only \u2013 the reason it\u2019s not a 100% is because there are some states..\nDoreen Spadorcia: Exactly.\nJay Fishman: That simply don\u2019t allow Quantum 2.0 as a model. So we are\u2026\nCharles Sebaski: What states would those be?\nDoreen Spadorcia: Well, I'll tell you, we just rolled out California and Massachusetts. It's a new product, but it's not Quantum. And we've got a few other states, North Carolina, we have to build something separately for that. But even in California and Massachusetts, which we were happy to bring them a new product because they didn't even get Quantum 1, it's a light version in terms of what the regulators allow us.\nJay Fishman: And that\u2019s largely because of the inability to use credit.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Credit, that\u2019s right.\nJay Fishman: As a upfront underwriting evaluator and pricer in those states.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Right.\nCharles Sebaski: Thank you. Sorry, didn\u2019t mean to cut you off. One additional question, I guess final, on the M&A and the consolidation front, and how you guys think of opportunities for growth internationally relative to the U.S.? If I look at your book and the market share, market share position leaders that you have in a lot, and the recent transactions with Dominion or South America, do you feel that the book or your business is more conducive to international opportunities? And how do you weigh that on a longer term perspective, given the need for return profile, and the other things you\u2019ve previously outlined?\nAlan Schnitzer: Charles, it\u2019s Alan, let me start with that and maybe Jay will follow-up. We certainly apply the same standards outside the United States as we do inside the United States. So the question is always, is the transaction going to contribute to our ability to create shareholder value overtime? So, same lens for evaluating all of it. Given our profile in the United States, given the market share of the franchises we have, that same analysis might apply differently outside the United States where there is just more GDP that we are not currently accessing. So we like the opportunity in Brazil long term, we like the transaction in Canada with the Dominion and we will continue as we\u2019ve been on this journey to export our competitive advantages from the U.S. to other markets. We will continue to build on a platform that\u2019s scalable and as we find those opportunities, we will again make every effort to complete those transactions. But \u2013 so we are certainly out looking for them and it\u2019s the exact same standard we would apply to transact in the U.S.\nJay Fishman: And I\u2019d just add one comment because we\u2019d take it for granted, sometimes you all forget. We are not a Fortune 100 or 200 guaranteed cost casualty underwriter. We\u2019re not a liability writer broadly, general liability, to what we would call global companies. So when we talk about outside U.S., we are talking about local business. This is now Brazilian companies or Canadian companies. We\u2019re very focused on the local environment. So, where the local environment has characteristics that would allow for either another competitor to come in and succeed or an acquisition opportunity where that local environment holds promise. We are ambitious for that. No issue at all. But it is a very local evaluation, not an evaluation of kind of the global insurance market.\nCharles Sebaski: And does your product portfolio and how you analyze the business within the U.S. lend itself to being able to do that internationally in the same way, I mean, do you get the same access to information and underwriting ability or are there difference that have, I guess, held you back from expanding more broadly or rapidly internationally?\nJay Fishman: There are certainly differences between marketplaces, but we think our fundamental approach to the business being disciplined about returns, being strong underwriters, all those cultural attributes do translate. And we think that given the sophistication we have in this marketplace, there\u2019s opportunities for us to deploy that sophistication in other less sophisticated markets and make a difference. But there are definitely differences market to market. I wouldn\u2019t say that necessarily holds us back, but it is one of the things that we assess and evaluate. But I would also observe that there are differences in the United States. Doreen just talked about our Quantum product and how we\u2019ve got to tailor that to different markets in the U.S. and we really take that same skill set of assessing our competitive advantages and figuring out how to deploy them in markets around the world. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done in our existing footprint and that\u2019s what we will continue to do whether it\u2019s in that footprint or in new geographies.\nCharles Sebaski: Thank you very much for the answers.\nJay Fishman: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Very good. This concludes our call for today. Thank you very much for joining us and we apologize for the disruption. We apologize for those we didn\u2019t get to in the queue, and we are available in Investor Relations to take your calls for the rest of the day. Thank you and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today.

And now, Jay Fishman.\nJay Fishman: Thank you, Gabi and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to start 2015 by reporting another strong quarter with operating income of $827 million or $2.53 per share and an operating return on equity of 14.5%. Our underwriting results remained very strong across all of our business units as evidenced by our combined ratio of 88.9%. Additionally, we achieved a record level of retention in domestic business insurance while simultaneously posting positive renewal rate change. With Quantum Auto 2.0 in full rollout, in Agency Auto, we achieved policy in force growth of 1.8%. The first-time that metric has been positive since 2011. We posted these results notwithstanding another severe winter and the reduction in net investment income from last year\u2019s first quarter. Jay will speak about our investment income in just a moment but for now suffice it to say that nothing happened that we had not contemplated or considered a possibility. The operating and production results for this quarter were being very encouraging and consistent with our belief that the amplitude of the historical cycle has narrowed. Importantly, this stability contributes to our confidence and our ability to continue to deliver superior returns on equity. The confidence that we have is in part evidenced by our capital management strategies. Today our Board of Directors announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.61 per share, marking the 11th consecutive year of dividend increases and bringing the compound annual growth rate on the dividend to nearly 10% over this time. In addition, we returned $850 million from capital to shareholders, bringing our total since 2006 to $31.6 billion. And we\u2019ve done all of that while continuing to make significant investments in our business and our people. Canada, Brazil and the data center in Omaha just to name a few. Rightsizing capital and reinvesting in the business are not mutually exclusive, both are fundamental to the way we think about the business for the long-term. We intend to continue with these strategies and in that regard, our Board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases. We\u2019ve made substantial progress in improving our product returns over the past five years through a thoughtful, focused and highly analytical approach to our business that has been well executed in the marketplace. We intend to continue on this path. In that regard, fixed income returns remain at historical lows and as a consequence, we must continue to be mindful that this challenging environment has already lasted far longer than most would have assumed and we will continue to factor that environment into our pricing strategies. In addition, we note that weather patterns do seem to be different. This change when combined with increased real-estate development, causes us to be very attentive to incorporating the real cost of weather uncertainty in our business. Part of the answer to this challenge above and beyond price and policy terms is helping our customers consider their risks and protect their assets in the most thoughtful ways possible. And we know that we and our independent agents are committed to helping customers do just that. As the world gets riskier, the value of thoughtful insurance advice goes up. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Jay. We are pleased with our first quarter results. Operating income of $827 million and operating return on equity of 14.5%, despite operating income being down $225 million from the very strong first quarter we had in 2014. Importantly, this decrease in operating income was not driven by deteriorating the underwriting results. As Jay just said, we reported a consolidated combined ratio of 88.9% this quarter. Rather the decrease in operating income primarily resulted from three items: Net investment income that was lower by a $104 million after tax; the inclusion in last year\u2019s first quarter of a $49 million after tax benefit from a change in state law that led to a reduction in our estimated liability for state assessments for workers\u2019 compensation premiums; and while still at high level, net favorable prior-year reserve development that was lower by $32 million after tax. Net investment income this quarter is being compared to a very strong first quarter last year and both fixed and non-fixed income returns were lower than the prior year quarter. Non-fixed income NII was lower principally due to private equity returns, which was slightly positive this quarter, as compared to a very strong first quarter last year. Energy related private equity funds produced negative NII of $21 million after tax, giving up a small fraction of what has previously been earned in these funds in recent years. While we cannot predict future oil prices and even though, we report private equity returns on a three months lag, a number of factors suggest that the vast majority of the impact of the recent decline in oil prices has been reflected in the current quarter\u2019s results. Current oil prices are slightly higher than at the yearend, share prices of public companies and our funds portfolios are also higher than they were at yearend and nothing we\u2019ve seen has reduced our confidence in the general partners of our portfolio funds. Additionally for non-energy related private equity funds, which represent approximately 85% of our private equity portfolio, returns were adequate this quarter, although far below what was an unusually good first quarter in 2014. Fixed income NII was lower principally due to what we\u2019ve been saying from many years now. Securities having higher book yields ran off during the past 12 months and were replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current interest rate environment. Another contributing factor was the level of short-term investments which yield very little, being somewhat higher this quarter than in the prior year quarter. Each of our business segments once again contributed to our net favorable prior year development, which totaled $243 million on a pretax basis. In business and international insurance, net favorable development of $77 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in the general liability product line for accident years 2005 and prior along with better expected loss experience in workers\u2019 comp for accident years 2007 and prior. In bond and specialty insurance, net favorable development of $35 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in contract surety for accident years 2010 through 2012. And in personal insurance, net favorable development of $131 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in recent accident years for home owners and auto liability coverages as well as better than expected loss experience in home owners for recent cat and non-cat weather related losses. On a combined state basis for all of our U.S. subs, there were no accident years or product lines that had any meaningful unfavorable development this quarter. Operating cash flows of $199 million compared to $703 million in the prior year quarter, a $504 million decrease entirely due to the $579 million payment we made this quarter in final settlement of the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation. As this amount was fully accrued at the beginning of the quarter, this payment had no impact on the quarter\u2019s operating income or share repurchases and it will have no impact on future share repurchases. Holding company liquidity was over $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized invest gains were approximately $3.2 billion pretax or $2.1 billion after tax, up from $3 billion and $2 billion respectively at the beginning of the year and book value per share was $77.96 or 1% higher than at the beginning of the year. I\u2019d point out that book value per share growth was achieved despite the negative impact of the strengthening of the dollar on foreign currency translations. Turning to capital management, we continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $850 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of a $178 million and repurchased $672 million of our common shares this quarter including $600 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and $72 million to primarily -- to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon investing and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Jay said, the Board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.55 to $0.61 per share and added an additional $5 billion for share repurchases. So with all that, let me now turn the mic over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thank you, Jay. Alan and Doreen will go over the individual segment results in a moment, but before they do I want to make a few comments on the impact of weather and the operating environment in the domestic commercial market price. Regarding the weather, patterns continue to be unpredictable and that was clearly evidenced by another challenging quarter. Weather losses in the first quarter of 2015 were slightly higher than the first quarter of 2014, but more importantly in both years we experienced losses above our expectations, driven by the polar vortex last year and the extreme snowing cold in the northeast in 2015. Much has been written about the snowfall in Boston this year, which at over 110 inches was a record for the season. But the real story is that nearly 95 inches of this snowfall came in just a 30-day period. To show just how unusual that was the Washington Post cited a meteorologist who calculated that Boston should not expect to see another 30 days with that much snow for another \u201capproximately 26,315 years.\u201d Now, I\u2019m not sure what they meant by approximately but suffice it to say was an extremely unusual event. As we think about the continuing unpredictability of weather patterns and our exposure to catastrophic weather losses, our expectations for cat losses are significantly higher today than they were just six or seven years ago. And importantly, historically we would have expected to have been below budget absent a fairly significant Atlantic storm. Unfortunately it has now become all too common for us to have significant cat losses from what we traditionally thought were the lower severity frequency events like tornado, hail and winter storms. So weather patterns are changing and accordingly we\u2019re continuing to reassess and manage our property exposure and pricing in a thoughtful way. Regarding the domestic commercial pricing environment, we feel very good about the returns we are seeing in this business and we are encouraged by the continued stability of the market. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we embarked on a strategy to improve the returns and profitability of our commercial business by increasing rate, improving terms and conditions, and focusing risk selection. We said that we would execute on this strategy thoughtfully and in a manner that would not be disruptive to the marketplace. Accordingly, our initial goal was to achieve gradual rate increases, eventually reaching a level that would drive significant improvement on the returns of our products over time. And once our returns had reached the appropriate levels, we hope to see rate moderate at a level that would allow us to sustain reasonable returns. Looking back, this is almost exactly what we have seen over the last four and half years. And we couldn\u2019t be more pleased not just in the results but in how we have achieved them. We couldn\u2019t have scripted it better. And with that, let me turn it over to Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Brian. Good morning. I feel very good about our performance in business and international insurance this quarter. Operating results were strong and importantly, we were encouraged by the continued stability in the U.S. marketplace as reflected in the facts that our retention is at a record level and we\u2019re still achieving renewal rate gains. As Brian said, we could not have scripted this better. The underlying combined ratio was 92.7%, an increase of 3.2 points over the prior year quarter. Eliminating the benefit from the state workers\u2019 compensation assessment in last year\u2019s first quarter, the underlying combined ratio increased by about 1 point, reflecting a typical level of quarterly fluctuation. Particularly in light of the severe winter weather that Brian mentioned, we feel great about the underlying profitability. Turning to the top line, net written premiums were up about 1% from the prior year quarter with the timing and structure of a number of reinsurance treaties and changes in foreign exchange rates having an adverse impact. Domestic net written premiums were up about 2% but adjusting for the timing impact of the reinsurance treaties, premiums were almost 3.5%. In our international business, net written premiums were down 7%, driven by the adverse impact of foreign exchange. The production results this quarter in our domestic business continue to be very encouraging. As we\u2019ve said in the last few quarters, more of our business is achieving target returns. And our objective has been to keep more of that business to our very granular account by account and class by class execution. Record retention this quarter, speaks to the success of that strategy. Renewal premium change was down about 1 point from the fourth quarter of last year and within that, pure renewal rate change was also down about 1 point. Notably, renewal rate change across most of our businesses has been steady for each of the three months within the current quarter. Turning to select, retention had a full year high and renewal premium change was strong at 7.3%. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the returns in this business and we\u2019ll continue to seek high retentions and higher levels of new business. In middle market, retention was a very strong 87% with over 90% retention on our best performing segments. Renewal rate change moderated less than 1 point in the fourth quarter to 1.1%. In terms of new business, we\u2019re very pleased with the results in middle market this quarter. As you\u2019ve heard from us, the impact of rate gains over the past four years has resulted in more new business opportunities that met our return threshold. The amount of new business we wrote in the quarter was impacted by the high volume of new business activity in the marketplace. January is a big month for new business submissions. Also it\u2019s worth noting that prior year quarter was particularly low from a new business standpoint. So that obviously contributes to the quarter-over-quarter increase. Our international business also posted solid production results. Over the past several quarters, renewal premium change has been steady and retention is trended up. In the current quarter, new business levels were lower than we would have liked, largely reflecting our disciplined response to conditions in the Lloyd\u2019s marketplace. I\u2019m pleased to note that as we announced last week, we agree to increase our stake in the P&C business with our Brazilian joint venture to 95%, up from 49.5%. We will maintain our 49.5% stake in the JV surety business. Our P&C business in Brazil is small. We launched it in 2012 and wrote about $20 million of net written premium last year but we continue to see long term growth opportunities. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. To sum it up, we feel great about the quarter. We\u2019re focused on maintaining attractive returns and we\u2019re well positioned to execute where we find opportunities. And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Thank you, Alan and good morning everybody. Bond and specialty insurance started 2015 with a strong first quarter and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was a $124 million, a reduction from the first quarter of 2014 due primarily to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development and lower net investment income. Underlying underwriting results remained very strong and well within our target. As for top-line, net written premium for the quarter was essentially flat to 2014 for both on management liability and surety businesses. Across our management liability businesses, retention and new business premium were both slightly improved from recent quarters while RPC levels remained broadly consistent. In sum, not a lot of movement in the quarter to highlight for you and we continue to feel great about this segment\u2019s result. I\u2019ll turn now to personal insurance, where we also had a terrific first quarter with strong underwriting results in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other. Operating income for the quarter was $252 million, down slightly from the first quarter of 2014 due primarily to lower net investment income. The underlying combined ratio was essentially flat to the prior year and had a level that we feel great about for the segment. Looking at Agency Auto, we once again delivered strong top-line and bottom-line results for the quarter and continued to be very pleased with the performance of this business. The 90.2% combined ratio for the quarter benefited from approximately 3 points of favorable prior year reserve development which was driven by better than expected severity in bodily injury. The underlying combined ratio of 93% was a slight improvement from an already strong 2014, and in a range we\u2019re comfortable with. Production results also continued to be strong driven by Quantum Auto 2.0; new business premium was 67% higher than the first quarter of 2014; and we continued to grow our policies in force which increased 21,000 during the quarter. Net written premiums increased 4% from the prior quarter. So by all measures, great results for Auto for the quarter. Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, we once again delivered strong financial results and we\u2019re making progress in production as we execute local product and pricing strategy. The overall combined ratio of 74.4% was strong and benefited from favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 79.5% is also well within our return expectations for the quarter. So, financial results remain strong as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. As for Agency Homeowners production, we said earlier that we continue to make progress. New business premium was up almost 40% from the prior year quarter and continues to trend favorably. We feel great about our market leading Homeowners\u2019 capability and know this product is a critical component of the customer package. Brian discussed the continued impact of weather. With these considerations in mind and our strong financial results in this line, we remain focused on improving our offering, both product features and process improvements to be again growing this business again. Based upon the new business trends we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re encouraged with our path. Lastly on Agency Homeowners & Other, net written premium was down 5%, primarily driven by the impact of changes in the timing and structure of certain of the company\u2019s reinsurance treaties. So to sum up, personal insurance had excellent results and a great start to 2015. And with that, I will turn the call back to Gabi.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Doreen. We are now ready for Q&A. And I would like to remind the participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Go ahead.\nRandy Binner: Two part question on reserves, especially in the commercial area. I saw the comments that you took some CGL in 2005 and prior and work comp in 2007 and prior but one, was wondering about more recent years in work comp and casualty lines, if those need to season more? And two if you could provide your initial take on the 2012 and 2013 accident years and the question there is given that you are about 36 months out from there and we had a mini hard market in pricing in those years and I think evidence of lost cost trends remaining benign, wondering how the 2012 and 2013 years are looking now that you can have a better view on that?\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. I\u2019ll try to wrap in some comments about all of that and some overview set. So, as it relates to the reserve development, these years do have to season a bit for us to get a good look on what the longer tail liabilities are doing. However, having said that, as you know, we have a very robust and granular process for looking at our reserves. So, we look at them every quarter. And if there are things that are developing either currently or from prior years that would have a rollover effect, which we call base year movement, into the current years will reflect that as appropriate. So looking at the more seasoned years at this point in time, we did take action to reduce reserves, as you pointed out in general liability and workers\u2019 comp for 2007, 2005 and prior, as we disclosed. None of that really had a major impact on the more current years. The current years haven\u2019t developed in any meaningful, way one way or the other at this point in time in the current quarter. There have been actions in previous quarters, some of the more recent accident years where we\u2019ve made some minor adjustments. But at this stage, as I had indicated earlier, there really was no meaningful unfavorable development taking place in any of our products, any of our accident years. And on the favorable side, we\u2019ve pointed out in a press release what that was.\nRandy Binner: And I guess the follow-up would be just kind of honing in on 2012 and 2013 and understanding they are not fully developed, but there is some amount of time that\u2019s passed. I mean given the pricing that was better then, do you have evidence that loss costs trends remained benign in that period of time or was there an elevation in loss cost trends in those years in particular. I guess from what we\u2019re seeing it seems like most loss cost trends for casualty have been incredibly benign, especially in those years.\nJay Benet: As we\u2019ve said in previous calls, we\u2019re not seeing anything as it relates to loss cost trends that\u2019s surprising to us or different from what our assumptions are. These are of course very long liabilities. So, you are going to react in a prudent way to any changing information that you see. And as it relates to this whole thing, which we\u2019re referring to as benign or whatever, everything is really dependent upon what your reserving assumptions. and as long as your reserving assumptions are based on what\u2019s taking place in the marketplace, you are not making adjustments for things, which is not to say over time, you wouldn\u2019t look further at the data and see things that would cause you to recognize favorable development or God forbid, unfavorable development. But at this stage, our reserves, as we always do are best estimates of what we see today and we\u2019ll just see how they develop going forward.\nJay Fishman: And it\u2019s Jay Fishman. Just let me add one point. Couple of times in your question, you referenced pricing and its impact on reserve. And we just don\u2019t -- pricing is not a factor as we set up reserves for our business. Our reserves are driven by costs. And the pricing what we sell it for is driven by the marketplace. And so the notion that our reserves are sit differently in a different pricing environment is just wrong; it\u2019s just not correct. So, what Jay I think is -- so far so good. So, far the estimates that we established in the years of which Jay referenced are continuing to stand up to whatever the developing trends are.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKai Pan: First question is on the margin and like classify the one point movements in terms of business margin deterioration as a quarterly fluctuation. So, just wonder has that one point impact by some non-cat large weather related losses and also going forward, if you see your pricing continue to accelerate, are we going to expect some continued margin expansion -- margin deterioration?\nAlan Schnitzer: Hi. It\u2019s Alan Schnitzer, let me take that. So, the one point that we characterized is typical fluctuations, maybe be rising from two components, one in the loss side. There is some fungibility of losses and we\u2019re talking about a relatively small numbers. So, it\u2019s hard to sort of necessarily pin point what those dollars were. But as we look at our analytics and our losses, what we really saw in the quarter was a very small, you can count them on one hand, a small number of large fires around the world; they contributed to after tax less than $20 million that maybe where that comes from. The rest of it was on the expense side and there is always going to be some normal fluctuations in expenses from period-to-period. In terms of the margin outlook, you could certainly look what rate is doing and what loss trend is doing and do a very narrow quantitative analysis and say Gee! Margins are going to shrink. We try to look at margins on a broader basis. So, lots of things other than the written rate and estimated loss trend that are going to impact margins going forward. You\u2019ve got things like volume exposure; mix; expenses; claim initiatives; weather large losses, all those things every quarter are going to have an impact on our results. And so, at least the away we look at written rate and loss trend at the moment, hard for us to say necessarily what margins going to do over the near-term. And we take our best shot in giving you some perspective on that in the outlook section of the 10-Q. So, I would suggest that if you haven\u2019t had a chance to look at that.\nJay Fishman: This is Jay Fishman. One other observation, your question and Alan\u2019s answer is in respect of written rate versus loss trend. Obviously on an earned basis, as we look forward to the rest of this year, looking over to Jay Benet to see from right, we anticipate that earned margin will continue to modestly expand from here, all other things being the same and they never are. So, I\u2019m simply talking about the calculation of earned rate versus loss trend modestly; everybody\u2019s pointing modestly here. So, it\u2019s not a matter of this year. I second the motion on Alan\u2019s comment, which is one is obviously the lower number than four and all other things being the same that would suggest some margin compression. But again, all other things are not the same, exposure, a meaningful portion of exposure; acts like rate; you get volume differences, you get productivity efficiencies. So, it\u2019s close. And I would hesitate on concluding definitively that return margins and therefore some time down the future earned margins at this level will by definition reduce, they may, possible but it\u2019s not -- it just isn\u2019t that clear yet, the numbers are just not -- that point is different.\nKai Pan: I have follow up on the reserve side. If you look at short tail of line releases over the past two years that account for a majority of the reserve releases, having in two years. I just wonder in hindsight because shorter line, you would imagine probably little bit easier to reserve than the long tail lines and what has helped you guys in the past two years in terms of short line reserve releases and the sustainability of that going forward?\nAlan Schnitzer: We can\u2019t talk about the sustainability of it, because going back to our reserving philosophy, we\u2019re always reserving at best estimate. So, we feel like we talk about some of the things that have caused the reserves to develop favorably. You say that short tail lines are easier to reserve for and it\u2019s an interesting phenomenon that takes place. If you are dealing with short tail and particularly if you\u2019re dealing with property, you have events that take place; in many cases, they\u2019re taking place in a current quarter where you\u2019re coming up with the estimates in that quarter. And even though it\u2019s a short tail business, you\u2019re dealing with not a lot of claim information at that particular time. So, you\u2019re looking at recent activity or historical activity to make judgments as to how those claims are going to develop; how the storms are going to develop. And depending upon the nature of the storm, where the storm hits, you could have situations where you are thinking that a tornado has a lot of hail associated with it; you look at the history of how that\u2019s developed and put up numbers and then as time goes on, we found that we overshot the mark a little bit because that particular storm didn\u2019t follow the pattern of previous storms in terms of the related hail damage. So, it\u2019s like everything else in reserving; you have some data upon which to make assumptions and then you extrapolate from that; you make your best estimate and then you\u2019re always adjusting it. And in the case of short tail, it conveys the higher fluctuations. What I really mean by that is the period of time in which you find, you\u2019re making the adjustments is a relatively short period of time; it\u2019s correcting quickly whereas in lines GL or workers\u2019 company, you can often that you\u2019re seeing long-term trends and you\u2019re evaluating them but the period of time in which you\u2019re making the adjustments can often times be over several quarters or even several years, it\u2019s just data getting more solid. So, it\u2019s an interesting aspect of reserving that I found intriguing when I first got involved in it. But as it relates to the short tail lines, you do see these fluctuations because you\u2019re dealing sometimes with very, very little data.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.\nAmit Kumar: Just two quick questions; the first question is for Doreen. The results in Auto were strong. Can you sort of expand on the loss costs comment? I think previously you\u2019ve mentioned that loss trends have remained at around 3%; is it fairly unchanged in terms of where we are in the quarter?\nDoreen Spadorcia: Yes, it is. We debated about whether to put that in and you\u2019d ask us about it anyway. So, yes, we do see the severity trends for Auto to be about 3% and that\u2019s all in. I guess -- I\u2019m just trying to think; and that includes bodily injury as well. That\u2019s a little bit higher but when you blend everything, it\u2019s about 3%.\nAmit Kumar: And sort of switching gears, this might be for -- this is a question on the surety piece. There have been recent press reports mentioning Malucelli and Petrobras; would it be possible to maybe talk about any go forward potential surety exposure you might have to this piece?\nAlan Schnitzer: It\u2019s way too early for us to really have any assessment on the impact on us from a surety perspective. This is just starting to unfold. What I will say is that we\u2019ve great confidence in our people down there; we\u2019ve got great confidence in our underwriting; we manage our gross and net exposures pretty carefully; and together with our partner and our local team, we continue to watch it. We don\u2019t have any reason at the moment to think that this is an outsized problem for us but I will reiterate that it\u2019s early and we\u2019re watching it.\nDoreen Spadorcia: The only thing I was going to add is that we remain very proud to be committed with J. Malucelli as a partner and they are one of those finest companies in Brazil. So with all of the discipline they bring and we bring, it\u2019s an unfortunate set of events but we feel like we\u2019re in the best position that we can be with that partner.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Go ahead.\nJay Gelb: Firstly, I just had a question on the buyback. The $5 billion authorization, do you anticipate that taking roughly two years to complete?\nJay Benet: This is Jay, Jay. We\u2019re not predicting what it is. I mean we talk about our share repurchases as being driven by our earnings. So, depending upon what you and others feel, our earnings look like going forward, you can do the math as to how long you think that share repurchase authorization will be out there for our utilization. And of course that\u2019s in addition to the remainder of the previous authorization which I think was another 80, 84 [ph]. So, I think looking at what your projections are and looking at the utilization in the past, you can come up with pretty good estimate of what you think it will be.\nJay Gelb: And then my follow-up question is on investment income. Given the drop off in the other investment income and in the first quarter of fixed income, investment income typically being seasonally highest in the first quarter, if I put that together, it looks like you could see at least a 10% decline in investment income after tax in 2015, maybe into the low-teens. Is my math okay?\nJay Benet: I think there is two pieces to that, one, looking at the fixed investments, we\u2019ve put some disclosure in our Q as to what we thought the period-over-period decrease on a quarterly basis would be for fixed income NII. And of course, the drivers of that are two-fold. One, the lower interest rate environment, as items mature either in the current quarter or really in the previous nine quarters as well, they are getting reinvested at the lower rate. So that will have an impact. And also as we pointed out, we paid the $579 million on the direct action, so those funds are no longer in the investment portfolio. And when you combine those two things, you\u2019re roughly at about a $30 million after-tax decrease on the fixed income NII. As it relates to the non-fixed income portion, we\u2019ve provided you data on what the composition of the portfolio is. You\u2019ve seen the historical yields associated with it. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball to say how the economy is going to perform and whatever. We\u2019ve tried to give information as it relates to the impact of the oil price decline and the feeling like we\u2019ve hopefully gotten to a point whether vast majority of whatever re-pricing or revaluations will take place have been captured. But I think you need to make your own estimates as to what you think that part of the portfolio will be.\nJay Fishman: It\u2019s Jay Fishman. I will give it to Bill Heyman in a second, just two points. I am not clear what your comment about seasonality in net investment income, is that\u2026?\nJay Gelb: On the fixed income, investment income for the year, seasonally it is highest in the first quarter?\nJay Fishman: No, it\u2019s seasonally -- it declines; these are just bond. Don\u2019t interpret that seasonality one there, [ph] it\u2019s just yield; that\u2019s all it is; it\u2019s the same bonds...\nJay Gelb: If I look at first quarter every year, it seems like the first quarter is the highest and then it shows off and\u2026\nJay Fishman: There is nothing about the fixed income -- our fixed income portfolio that has any seasonality to it whatsoever. Other than as time progresses and more of the portfolio is reinvested at lower rates, we\u2019ve been saying it for years now, the net investment income will go down over time. No seasonality in that number at all. As it relates to the energy dynamic, I would point out that we put out a schedule in last quarter\u2019s webcast which summarized our private equity investments and what we thought was. And we defined as the energy space; my recollection is that somewhere around $760 million or so, inclusive I think. We have to go back; I am working from memory. But it\u2019s not insignificant but hardly overwhelming. So, those are the two points I\u2019d add on investment income.\nBill Heyman: Jay, it\u2019s Bill Heyman. What you see as seasonality is really a degradation of book yield that\u2019s gone on now for three years or four years. And we calculate it more or less to the basis points and quarter-by-quarter. And so that slope -- the slope of the slope will change over time. But the direction of the slope will persist for a while. Our basic allocation here which is 93% and 94% to fixed income is designed so that even if investments other than fixed income don\u2019t perform, which we know on occasion they won\u2019t, our interest revenues assuming we collect them even at these levels are enough to give the company a shot at an overall ROE in our target range. And that\u2019s the policy and that\u2019s not really an accident. In terms of the non-fixed income portfolio, I know we\u2019re making the comparison this morning to the first quarter of 2014, but I think it\u2019s instructed to look at this quarter against the fourth quarter of 2014 and then the fourth quarter against the third quarter of 2014. And you can see that for non-fixed income investment as a whole and the webcast and the bottom right of page six, but that includes the entire university. In private equity, the decline over the last two quarters was pronounced. So, this doesn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise. And given the elevated levels of the first three quarters of 2014, you can see comparisons like this again for a couple of quarters yet. What I think we can say is that since we receive results and report them to you on a quarterly lag, we try to go behind them and look at marketing conditions and determine whether there is in the portfolio some embedded but yet unreported loss that means that these marks are less accurate. We don\u2019t see that. Obviously our vision isn\u2019t perfect. But Jay Benet alluded to developments in oil prices and in the publicly held securities of these funds and we looked at equity markets generally, but it is what it is. And for what is worth real estate this quarter performed very well at levels equal to first quarter 2014. Hedge funds performed better; the shortfall was in private equity and 50% of it came from 15% of the portfolio. So, that\u2019s the story.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Go ahead.\nJosh Stirling: Jay, I wanted to ask a follow up question on the Kai\u2019s question about where we are on pricing relative to loss trends and how that implies your future margins. So, I guess I\u2019m really curious, where do you think the breakeven point is going to be for future margin compression? If we sort of dial back, I think a year ago, maybe 3% to 4% is what a lot of companies were saying, you\u2019d want to cover loss trend with and now it\u2019s been 1.4% versus maybe the CPI something approaching to. I know there is lots of moving pieces; you mentioned some of them. But where do you think the level is that we think might be margin compression, kind of pricing levels? And if you don\u2019t mind the question; you guys have led us through this pricing cycle so far; will you draw line in the sand to preserve margins before you get to that point?\nJay Fishman: First, we really don\u2019t perseverate annually as much as perhaps you will do on weather margins or a little bit wider or a little bit smaller. We\u2019ve got -- I don\u2019t know, the last time I looked we have close to 1 million commercial lines accounts each one of them are priced one at a time. And so the notion that we somehow think or manage with that level of granular dynamic is just -- it\u2019s almost we occasionally show you the distribution of rate gains across the entire book and that should impress you with the diversity of it that every account is priced on its own. So, I start off first with philosophical answer to that, not that I won\u2019t try and answer your question; the honest answer to it is that, I just don\u2019t know. What we do believe, what we are currently recording is an aggregate overall loss trend of 4%. That remains across our entire commercial book; our business book unchanged; it\u2019s independent of whatever CPI numbers come out or producer price index. We were pretty granular about our loss trend and feel that we try hard to get right. The reason we try and get it right is a whole lot less about reserving than it is pricing. We price our product to losses and if we don\u2019t have our losses right, we are not going to get right price, so we get very driven and very focused on that. So, if you wanted to do just simple arithmetic, let\u2019s say unless you get four points of written rate, all other things being the same, margins will begin to go down, but all other things are just not the same. Exposure, we\u2019ve talked about this many times in the past, has a fair amount of activity in it that looks like rate, acts like rate, an example would be an increase in property limits on a building. You collect what premium, rent it; there are more limits at risk, but absent the total loss, that number will act in the calculation equivalent to rate. And so when we start trying to analyze it, the best answer that we can give you right now is it closed; it\u2019s closed. But again it\u2019s not as if we perseverate much at all on whether it\u2019s up a little bit or took me not up, down a little bit or flat; it\u2019s just not -- we think about returns over time, not about -- importantly not about margin in any given quarter, returns over time, it\u2019s how we think about it. So that\u2019s sort of our outlook. In terms of lines in the sand, we always enjoy that. It\u2019s nothing different about that. One of the things that\u2019s impressive to me and Alan shared some of this data with your couple of quarters ago: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s dated. We don\u2019t even quote on round numbers. 60% of the request reports that we get in commercial accounts; it varies, 60% to 70%, something like that. Am I close on that still, just wanted? And so the line in the sand starts right there. It\u2019s not as if -- we don\u2019t quote on more business than we do quote. And then our hit rate is a function of that smaller quote rate. So, we draw lines in the sand every single day at every account; it\u2019s not a philosophical line in the sand, it\u2019s an account by account philosophical line in the sand. And that\u2019s just so important. We don\u2019t pressure underwriters for volume, we don\u2019t. If you do, you will get volume; you won\u2019t like what you get; that\u2019s been our philosophy but you will get it. We let them run their business with tremendous amounts of data like adults making thoughtful decisions managing it for the long-term. So, now we draw lines in the sand all the time.\nBill Heyman: I would just add to that in terms of the line in the sand. As you heard from us, we are return focused and that\u2019s our objective as we underwrite account by account or class by class and that return will take into account interest rates; competitive conditions in the marketplace; everything else. So why we are drawing lines in the sand on account, we\u2019re not going to look at some magical return and going to say that\u2019s it, we\u2019re stopping. That\u2019s going to change and it\u2019s going to take in account all the facts and circumstances over time.\nJay Fishman: One of the questions that we\u2019ve been asked over a long period of time and our answer has been the same. To us, the leading indicator about lack of stability in the market and the way in which you can best assess the sort of near term is retention. It is really to me personally given my experience is remarkable that we had a record retention in our domestic business insurance business while still getting positive renewal rate. I just think that\u2019s really quite remarkable and speaks to the stability of the business. If you want to get a sense of churn, you look at retention. And I\u2019m getting a little long in the tooth but I go back to the late 60s when retentions in the middle market were in high 60s; 70 was considered a pretty stable month. This quarter in the middle market, we were like in the 87%; it just shows you the magnitude of the difference and really I think just reinforces the way in which we run the business.\nJosh Stirling: Jay, that\u2019s really helpful. As we sort of think about simplifying now this, my guess and one follow up on that, then I\u2019ll let you guys move. If I integrate what you\u2019ve all just said which I think is sort of near your breakeven point on margin compression and you\u2019re happy with rates but in your outlook you said that basically that you expected pricing to be broadly consistent for the rest of the year with level was in the first quarter. Did that mean we should basically be interrupting that as sort of the slowing pricing trend of the past seven or eight quarters, which has been relatively stable, kind of stop here where I see you guys try to keep pricing where it is here for foreseeable future?\nJay Benet: So again, I\u2019ve got to fall back to the account by account discussion because that\u2019s how we think of pricing, not as a single manifest order to the organization. Some underwrite is sitting with an agent and they\u2019re talking about an account that\u2019s had -- and I use this example all the time, three consecutive years of price increases and that account has been doing just fine. And the agent and the underwriter come to conclusion that it\u2019s appropriate to renew that account flat, we are off for it; we are off for that; no issue at all. If the conversation is that the account absorbs a tremendous amount of cost and risk management and loss experience is kind of marginal and therefore we should be asking for a fourth consecutive increase, we will. It\u2019s by the account. What is true over all is that more of our business has moved into what one would consider return good, return acceptable than it was two, three, four years ago. So, as low as account by account decisions get made, they get made in a different framework of return to the company. We think that\u2019s great, couldn\u2019t be happier about the way our field underwriters execute on that. So, it\u2019s not a matter of us sending out a message that says stop here. We never would say that. Our message is, look at the account; look at the cost; look at the expenses; look at the load; look at the class of business; do you want it part of your portfolio; does the account have stability? Use your best judgment, do the right thing and we leave it to them. And that\u2019s -- so I can\u2019t -- if rate were to go flatten from here and people were pursuing that, it\u2019d be fine in the aggregate. If rate were to go down in another point and they were pursuing in that strategy, it\u2019d define. The rate in the end is the result of tens of thousands of transactions, not a single order that\u2019s given out to the field. And just to that, I would just add that on our most challenged segments of business, we continue to get rate in excess of loss trend.\nJay Fishman: Yes that actually is so darn important because it speaks to the granularity of the strategy that where accounts are not meeting our return expectations. We already drove in affecting and come back to that; we draw the line and we\u2019re we\u2019re getting rate at that point exceeding loss trend. So, so important for us. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.\nMichael Nannizzi: Maybe if we could talk a little bit about the personal agency channel bid. Clearly, Quantum is having a positive impact. It looks you are winning business; getting rate and keeping retentions high and the margins look good. Just trying to understand sort of the competitive environment there and what\u2019s giving you the ability to win consistently post that Quantum 2.0 change? And is it an area of focus, a demographic or a scale advantage possibly, building risk profile of the book, something else that\u2019s giving you an opportunity to continue you to generate positive new business there? Thanks.\nDoreen Spadorcia: Hi, Mike; this is Doreen. Let me just bring it back probably a year or so, so you know what we put in place. But we actually did some back testing and what we needed to do to be more competitive in the customer segment that we wanted. And when we looked at that, we thought that our expenses needed to be adjusted. And so that\u2019s what we did. We took the $140 million out of our operating costs as well as reduced the commission on the new products. And what we told our agents -- so first of all I want to give them great credit because notwithstanding that sort of salary change, they were great partners and supported that. And what we told them was we wanted them to be competitive across channels. We weren\u2019t doing this just so they could switch one company\u2019s business to us. We wanted them to be able to compete with a captive and the direct writers. And while I wouldn\u2019t say that the price points are always what those companies are, it made us and them much more competitive in those customer segments. But I mean the whole thing, you need an organization that\u2019s willing to execute to that; you need strong agency relationships; and at the end of the day, you need a product that people want.\nMichael Nannizzi: And have competitors reacted to kind of post this success or they kind of stuck with their? I am sure you can see from your own win rate, have others tried to replicate this success or are you still able to hold that lead?\nDoreen Spadorcia: We can see it in little pockets Mike but nobody has really taken the approach of adjusting their cost base. So, if they are doing that with pricing, we can see a little bit of that, but nothing where we\u2019ve seen a major restructure, so that the offering would be similar.\nMichael Nannizzi: Got it. And then you mentioned direct really quickly; I am just curious, I mean there is obviously a little bit more increasing certainly led [ph] on some new entrants into the direct channel. Just given and maybe if we talk a little about the direct initiative at Travelers and how you are thinking about investments there and the potential for do any of these new market participants, do they provide an opportunity for Travelers or is it something that you are just kind of wait and see at this point? And thank you so much for all the answers.\nDoreen Spadorcia: On the direct to consumer initiative, I think Jay and Greg have talked about this in the past. And we still feel like there is a very strong value proposition for the customers that we have and the advice that they get from agents. We just haven\u2019t seen sort of a run on the bank that maybe would have been predicted a decade ago. That being said, we also think it\u2019s very prudent to make sure that we have multiple channels of business, because our goal is the customers that we like, we would like to bring in the door anyway they\u2019d want to come in. All that being said, I know there has been some talk about some entrants in the marketplace. And I think I would tell you our view is to just evaluate and wait and see what that might bring. We\u2019ve made no decisions and we\u2019re in observation mode.\nJay Fishman: It\u2019s, jay Fishman. I\u2019d add a couple of points; Doreen\u2019s got it all right, which is that one of the things that is and we\u2019ve said this before, nothing new in this, but increasingly, it\u2019s in the data. The nature of the customer who chooses to buy directly is a different customer than that which seeks advice. And it\u2019s not just the nature of the customer but it\u2019s the risk management need. So broadly speaking and this comes from our experience with being a GEICO partner from many, many years, the percentage of renters and amongst GEICO customer is a multiple of what the renter population is in our agency business. The percentage of minimum and low limit buyers for Auto who buy direct are a multiple of those low limits or minimum limits that buy directly. Now that\u2019s not a 100% and it\u2019s not an absolute statement, but broadly speaking, you would say that the nature of the risk management needs based upon data, not anecdotal; not television customers but based upon the data is that they are different. Now that\u2019s in effect really good news for us, because the agency business that we direct our attention to has been much more resilient and robust than people 10 years ago might have suggested.\nMichael Nannizzi: Sure.\nJay Fishman: Maybe that changes in the future; it\u2019s possible and it would be foolish of us to be arrogant enough to say that that customer could never be attracted. And so we\u2019re going to continue to develop the technology, such that if that business dynamic changes, we\u2019re in a position to respond. But several quarters ago, our conclusion was and we shared with you that the nature of the customer that we seek is not yet buying enough through direct channel that the business is a scalable business around that. To make it scalable, you have to be as that different sentiment and that\u2019s just not our sweet spot. So, I\u2019d say Gee! It would have been nice if the direct channel would have developed more robustly. But believe me when I tell you, as I had to pick one versus the other going into this, I\u2019m much happier that the Agency channel has remained more robust than people would have suspected.\nOperator: And the next question comes; the final question comes from the line of Jay Cohen, Bank of America. Go ahead.\nJay Cohen: Just a couple of clean up questions, the first is can you discuss what the non-cat weather was in the quarter because with all these winter storms, certainly in the northeast, it was hard to tell what was cat and non-cat. So were the non-cat numbers elevated at all?\nJay Benet: Yes, Jay; this is Jay Benet. We actually had only one storm raise to the level of a cat for us. So, most of the winter storm activity that took place this quarter was non-cat weather, as we described or differentiate between cat versus non-cat. And looking at this year versus last and I think Brain made the comment, the weather in this quarter was heightened from what we would think of as a -- if there is such a thing anymore as a normal quarter was heightened from that. Last year was also a heightened weather quarter. And while the data is -- it\u2019s the voluminous data, but it\u2019s also challenging data to say exactly this is a weather loss; this isn\u2019t a weather loss. The feeling around here is that the weather losses this year were elevated from the weather losses last year, but they weren\u2019t off the charts different, they were just a bit higher than they were last year. That would be the feeling we get from the data. So, higher than normal; whatever normal is these days; a bad winter season last year; bad winter season this year; this year all in a little higher than last year and that would go for both cats as well as non-cat.\nJay Cohen: And then the second question was, you talked about I guess some of the changes in reinsurance and the impact on premiums. Can you discuss those changes and what drove the premium impact?\nJay Benet: The primary one is the change in the cat program that we announced last quarter. As you recall, our cat reinsurance was generally done, was always done on July 1, and the new cat aggregate treaty that we put in place was the January 1 deal. So the premium for that is primarily what we\u2019re seeing in this quarter through the seeded line that\u2019s impacting the quarter-over quarter comparisons because last year there was no premium for that.\nJay Fishman: It shows up in the quarter and which is amortized to be clear.\nJay Benet: Alright whereas last year in the third quarter of 2014, we would have seen a similar payment taking place; whereas on July 1 on this year, we will not be making that payment because we\u2019ve already made it.\nJay Cohen: Is easier comparison in July should be up a little bit more than expected?\nJay Benet: Yes.\nGabriella Nawi: Very good.

And now Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning we\u2019ve released solid underwriting and investment results with record net and operating earnings per share for the quarter. Operating income was $919 million, generating an operating return on equity of 16.4%. This brings our full year operating income to nearly $3 billion and operating return on equity to 13.3%. That\u2019s in line with the 13.5% average annual operating ROE we\u2019ve delivered over the last ten years. During the year, we grew adjusted book value per share by 7% after returning more than $3.2 billion of excess capital to our share holders. Overall, our underwriting results for the year were strong as evidenced by our consolidating combined ratio of 92%. Underwriting results in business and international insurance were solid, and once again, we posted impressive underwriting results in bond and specialty insurance. Despite the disappointing impact of higher than expected personal auto bodily injury losses. Our personal insurance combined ratio for the year was 95.1%, demonstrating the value of having a balanced homeowners and auto personalized business. In our commercial business, we continue to be successful in the execution of our marketplace strategies. That resulted in continued historically high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change in the quarter, all of which reflects stable environment. In our core middle market business peer renewal rates change improved by 4 points from the third quarter as we continue to execute at a very granular level to achieve our written return objectives. I shall hear from Brain in terms of new business, we continue to be quite active in terms of submission and quote activity, but also fall in terms of underwriting discipline. Turning to personal insurance, as you've seen, the results by line were mixed. Our homeowners business once again produced excellent results and grew net written premium for the first time since 2011. In our Auto business, we're clearly disappointed by the underwriting results. During the fourth quarter, bodily injury losses were higher than expected and they developed unfavorably for the first three accident quarters of 2016 and the back half of 2015. Our claim data, the public chatter we hear from others in the marketplace and other third party data, all calls us to continue to believe that our experience is principally environmental as opposed to specific to us or a Quantum Auto product. Whilst trends change in our business, and as I've said before, our objective is to recognize it and react to the data we have as quickly as possible. We're taking actions to improve the personal auto profitability, and Brain will address this in more detail. Before I pass the mic to Jay Benet, let me conclude with this. 2016 was another strong year adding to our long-term record of delivering superior results. We entered 2017 with a great deal of momentum, and we're well positioned for continued success. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Alan. As Alan mentioned, we were very pleased with our results this quarter; a record net and operating income per diluted share of $3.28 and $3.20 respectively; operating income of $919 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter; and operating ROE at 16.4%. These results were driven by the continued solid underwriting performance as evidenced by our consolidated combined ratio of 90%, which included the favorable impact of prior year reserve developments which I'll discuss shortly, as well as the unfavorable impacts and cat losses of the $137 million pretax related to Hurricane Matthew and the fires and Tennessee, and higher than expected auto BI losses in personal insurance. The quarter also benefitted from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute and higher after-tax net investment income, which, after increasing sequentially quarter-by-quarter this year, increased 12% this quarter over the prior year quarter, all due to higher non-fixed income returns. Fixed income NII of $405 million after-tax was down $17 million from the prior year quarter due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment. Looking forward, into 2017 and based on the current interest rate environment and the specific securities that are scheduled to mature in 2017, we expect approximately $15 million to $20 million of lower after tax NII on a quarterly basis in 2017 when compared to the corresponding periods of 2016. This is a $5 million per quarter improvement for what we communicated last quarter due to the recent rise in interest rates. And of course, if interest rates were to continue to rise from the current levels, this expected decrease in fixed income NII would be reduced even further. In contrast of the decrease in fixed income NII, non-fixed income NII of $96 million after-tax was up $71 million from the prior year quarter, driven by significantly higher private equity returns. We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $264 million pretax this quarter, down a bit from the $292 million pretax in the prior year quarter. In business and international, net favorable development of $234 million pretax was driven by better than expected loss experienced in workers' comp and general liability. While in bond in special take, net favorable development of $75 million pretty tax resulted from better than expected loss experienced and fidelity and surety and general liability. Reserve development was unfavorable this quarter, and personal insurance $45 million pretax, driven by higher than expected auto BI injury losses related to the later part of the 2015 accident year. This corresponds with the increase in auto BI loss estimates that we made for the current accident year, which Brian will be discussing. In total, for the full year, we have consolidated net favorable reserve development of $771 million pretax with approximately $665 million coming from our U.S. operations and $106 million coming from international. As I\u2019ve done in the past, I\u2019m also providing you with some inside into what our combined 2016 Schedule P is expected to show when we file it on May 01. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines, in the aggregate, would have developed favorably. On a Schedule P product line basis, all of our commercial products will show favorable developments or very modest amounts of unfavorable development. For personal insurance, homeowners will show a modest amount of unfavorable development, primarily resulting from the higher than expected loss experience, that I discussed in the third quarter webcast related to a small number of liability claims from accident years 2013 and 2014, and private passenger auto liability will show the unfavorable development that I just referred to. There are two topics I would like to cover relating to reinsurance. First, we\u2019re very pleased this quarter to have settled with one of our reinsurers in the USF&G versus AMRI at Elcase [ph], a reinsurance dispute that\u2019s been pending for many years. As result of the settlement, we recognize a $126 million pretax, or $82 million after-tax gain, in our fourth quarter earnings. I refer you to the Form 10-K that we filed on November 8th for more information related to this settlement. Second, as shown on page 21 of the webcast, effective January 01, we renewed our corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty that provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior year and at a slightly lower cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage part of $2 billion in excess of $3 billion after $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad peril and geographic coverage and the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital, the treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions. And please note that the total costs of this treaty and therefore the reduction in costs are quite small in relation to our operating income. Operating cash flows were very strong this quarter, $1.14 billion, including the proceeds from the settlement of the reinsurance dispute I just mentioned, and after making $200 million discretionary contribution to our now fully funded U.S. qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows for the year to over $4.2 billion. We continue to generate much more capital than is needed to support our businesses, and consistent with our on-going capital management strategy, we returned $942 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter with dividends of $191 million and common share repurchases of $151 million. For the full year, we returned over $3.2 billion of excess capital to shareholders through dividends of $762 million and common share repurchases of over $2.4 billion. Holding company liquidity ended the year at $1.68 billion, well above our target level. And our debt to total capital ratio, excluding the impact of net unrealized investment gains, ended the year at 22.3%, well within its target range. Net unrealized investment gains were $1.1 billion pretax, or $0.7 billion after-tax, down from almost $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the due to the recent run-up in interest rates and spreads. As you may recall, we generally as a buy and hold approach with fixed income investing, so any change in unrealized that relates to a change in the general level of interest rates is something we do not pay much attention to. Cash flows from the portfolio are what matter to us. Book value per share of $83.05 grew 4% from the beginning of the year. And importantly, adjusted book value per share of $80.44, which eliminates the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains, grew by 7% this year. With that, let me give the microphone over to Brain.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. I\u2019ll start with business and international insurance, where we are pleased with our full year financial and production results. We continue to generate excellent returns, achieving a combined ratio of 94.3%. Retention for our domestic businesses remained at historically high levels. And we successfully achieved positive rate change with renewal premium increases of over 2%. As Alan mentioned, retention for the industry remains very strong, reflecting a stable marketplace. And in that light, we were quite pleased that we were able to generate nearly $2 billion of new business premiums, up slightly from 2015. Looking at the quarters financial results, operating income of $722 million was higher than the prior year quarter by $156 million with a very strong combined ratio of 89%. Operating income included the $82 million after-tax gain related to the settlement of a reinsurance dispute that Jay mentioned earlier. This gain was in other income, and accordingly, do not benefit the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 93.1. The underlying loss ratio was 1.4 points lower than the prior year due to lower large losses and non-catastrophe weather related losses, partially offset by a modest amount of margin compression. Turning to production, given the returns that we are generating in the segment, our focus continues to be on retention. And we are very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change of two and half points included renewal rate change of seven tenths of point, which was higher than recent quarters, while new business came in at $439 million for the quarter. Turning to the individual businesses, in select, retention continued its improving trend and came in at a strong 83%. Renewal premium change was nearly 6 points, and we generated new business premiums of $92 million, up 7% versus the prior year. In middle market, retention of 87% remained at a historically high level, while renewal premium change was over 2 points, including 1.4 points of renewal change, or 4 point higher than the third quarter. New business activity, as measured in submissions and quotes, has been up for the year and in the quarter remained consistent with the prior year. However, as 2016 progressed, fewer of these opportunities met our underwriting standards and/or return objectives, and accordingly, new business premiums of $226 million in the quarter, were down 9% year-over-year. In other business insurance, renewal premium change was down slightly with a relatively flat rate environment compared to the third quarter of 2016. While retention remained strong at 80% and new business premiums up $121 million. New business volumes for other business insurance were impacted by the same market dynamics, I discussed the middle market. In international, production results were very strong in the quarter. Retention remained at 82%, while renewal premium change of over 2 points was higher than recent quarters with the biggest single driver of the increase being Lloyds, which due to the transactional nature of that market, is subject to variability. New business volume of $91 million was up 14% year-over-year driven by Lloyds, including the results of our new global construction and renewable energy groups. So all-in for the segment, it was a very good quarter, capping off the year with strong production and profitability. Before turning to bond and specialty, I want to comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won\u2019t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio during 2017 will be broadly consistent with those in 2016. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward looking statement disclaimers. I\u2019ll turn to bond and specialty insurance, which continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $161 million remained strong and was in line with the prior year\u2019s quarter; as in improved underlying underwriting margin was offset by slightly lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development; the underlying combined ratio of 79.7 for both the quarter and year with the full year result being an all-time best for the segment. On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were consistent with the prior year for both surety and management liability. In our management liability business, we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best performing accounts while writing new business in return adequate product segments. And so, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that retention for the quarter was a record 88%, while we added $41 million of new business. Renewal premium change of 2.3 points down about a point from recent quarters, reflecting the mix change impacting average policy duration. The other components of renewal premium change that drive profitability were essentially unchanged. So bond and specialty results remained terrific and we continue to feel great about the segment\u2019s performance and execution in the market. In terms of outlook as with business insurance, for 2017, we expect both the underlying underwriting margin and underlying combined ratio will be broadly consistent with 2016. Turing to personal insurance, net return premiums for the segment grew 12% in the quarter with a combined ratio of 98.2 and an underlying combined ratio of 93.2. For the full year, net written premiums grew 10% with a combined ratio of 95.1 and an underlying combined ratio of 90.1. So, overall, strong results for the segment, but results by line were mixed. In auto, as Alan mentioned, we booked further upward revisions in our loss estimates for 2016 and for the second half of 2015. The auto combined ratio for the quarter was 116.7 and include both the full year impact of the bodily injury related adjustments that I just mentioned, and seasonably higher fourth quarter loss levels. So instead of taking you to a detailed reconciliation of the quarter, it would be more productive to focus on the full year ratios. For the full year combined ratio, we had a 104.0 and the underlying combined ratio was 101.8. These were both higher than we expected and at a level that does not meet our target returns. For full year 2016 underwriting combined ratio included about 2 points from the 10-year effect that we discussed last quarter. As we said then, when you are growing your book of business, the higher levels of new business will temporarily increase the combined ratio and the impact of 10 year in the year was as we expected. In addition to the impact of 10-year, the full year of 2016 underlying combined ratio was elevated by 3.5 points due to the recognition of the increased bodily injury liability losses. This result represents a gap that we are working to close. You will recall that we reacted to signs of adverse bodily injury loss development with a reserve adjustment in the third quarter. Unfortunately, since then, we saw a further development in excess of even those increased expectations, which drove our actions this quarter. The deterioration is primarily driven by an increase in the trend towards more severe accidents. Some of the factors that lead us to this observation are a higher percentage of claims involving distracted driving, more accidents involving higher speeds and more accidents on highways and at intersections. This is also consistent with recent industry data. For example, the National Safety Council report of significantly higher traffic cyclicalities in 2015 and 2016, a two year trend that we haven\u2019t seen in decades. In response to these developments, we are taking action in the marketplace. Our primary response is to file for increased base rate. And in November and December of 2016, rate increases were implemented in 16 states, which cover about 60% of our quote volume. More rate changes at higher aggregate levels are planned for 2017 along with other ongoing actions to refine and optimize our underwriting process. The combined impact of these actions should be to both reduce the rate of growth and improve profitability. While it will take 18 to 24 months for the actions we\u2019re implementing to fully earn into the portfolio, we do expect that the auto combined ratio will improve in 2017. Turning to homeowners and other, our results for the quarter and the full year remains strong, and reinforce the value of a portfolio underwriter. The underlying combined ratio of 70.4 for the quarter and 75.7 for the year, demonstrate consistent performance relative to 2015. In terms of top line 2016 saw growth in net written premiums of 2%, and we look to continue the momentum in 2017. So, as I said, mixed results by line in the segment with challenges in auto mitigated by strong results in home, resulting in a segment combined ratio of 95:1 for the full year. We are fully aware that our recent auto results need to improve. Pricing and underwriting actions we\u2019re implementing should put us on track to deliver a more profitable portfolio in the years ahead. Finally, as it relates to our outlook for personal insurance, we expect underlying underwriting margins during 2017 will be slightly higher than in 2016, and the underlying combined ratio during 2017 will be broadly consistent with 2016. In agency automobile, we expect underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio will improve in 2017 compared to 2016. In agency homeowners and other, we expect that underlying underwriting margins will be slightly lower, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly higher in 2017 than in 2016, reflecting higher and more normalized levels of loss activity. With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. We're now ready to start the Q&A portion. Before we start, if I could just ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Nannizzi: Brian may be a little bit on auto. If you could just give us some indication of how we should be thinking about the starting points for \u201917, and given the adjustments you made through the year. When should we start to see the rate increases flow through? And should we expect the starting point to be closer to the develop loss ratio picks you have said now for \u201816?\nMichael Klein: Michael, this is Michael Klein from Personal Insurance. I\u2019ll take a crack at that. So, I think you will see the rate increases start to flow through in the first quarter. As Brian said, we began making rate filings in the fourth quarter, really in response to what we saw in the third quarter. Rate filings that we\u2019re now making as we looked ahead to the first half of the year reflects the increased loss of content that we saw in the fourth quarter. Importantly, you don\u2019t see a lot of the fourth quarter rate filing activity in the production statistics, just because of the timing of those rate increases. They went in November and December, largely impacted renewals not until December. And so, it\u2019s really a timing issue in terms of not seeing and show-up in the fourth quarter of this year. But we would expect that you will see the rate momentum start to build in the first quarter of 2017, and continue from there. In terms of the starting point for 2017, I would say two things; first of all, as Brian mentioned that 3.5 points that you see on the webcast slide. He mentioned that represents a gap that we\u2019re looking to close. And so in other words that 3.5 points is built into our base-line expectations as we start 2017. And then we\u2019re taking trend and forecasting in actual word from that point. So, the starting point does include that 3.5 points of additional losses and the gap that we\u2019re looking to close.\nBrian MacLean: Michael, just let one -- this is Brian. I would also just emphasize, obviously, thinking through the written versus earned dynamic with the rate. And as we obviously get it on a written basis, it has to earn-in overtime; hence, my comment of 18 to 24 months to work-through the 3.5 points.\nMichael Nannizzi: And then when you think about the -- and most of your policies are 50-50 annual versus six month policies. Is that right, or somewhere in that range?\nMichael Klein: It\u2019s a little bit more tilted towards the annual. So, it's about 60-40 annual versus six months.\nMichael Nannizzi: And then Brian when you mentioned the margin outlook for \u201917 versus \u201916.does that contemplate that whatever trend you\u2019re seeing is sort of the need-year, and that we\u2019re not going to see more deterioration? Or does that contemplate that you\u2019re going to see that, the loss trend continue to increase, at may be some pace not at same levels we\u2019ve seen, or if you give some context there, thanks.\nBrian MacLean: I think, as Michael just said, the 3.5 elevation is built into our expectation. Above that, we're expecting normal 3.5% loss trend, which includes more normal inflation of severity. But we don\u2019t expect another spike. Michael?\nMichael Klein: I would say that just to clarify, so Brain mentioned the 3.5 loss trend. That is an elevated loss trend relative to where we've been. So the forecast, importantly, I think, it's important to take away that and includes both the increased base-line and a higher trend estimate going forward than we had in the past. It's modestly higher but it is a bit of an increase at front.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKai Pan: First question is just on the deterioration of fourth quarter. What exactly, sort of like if you are looking back in third quarter, what exactly sort of like accelerate in terms of loss cost trend from the third quarter? And just want to get the confidence that over that what you book in the fourth quarter. Do you think that's -- and it probably not be much matured like a deterioration from that levels?\nBrian MacLean: Yes. So the first thing I would say, Kai, it's all the normal stuff. Now, we're talking about very recent accident periods for a very long tail-line of business, so just as a perspective. At the end of 2016, we have paid less than 15% of what we believe the ultimate losses will be for auto bodily injuries. So, it's by nature a long tail-line of business, so it takes a while to play-out. We\u2019re looking at all of the activity that we see, both in frequency and severity of loss, cut every which way you can think of, and looking at frequency activity, incurred losses, the paid losses. And importantly, we're also, as we went into 2016, we're looking at that coming loss of 2013, \u201914 and early \u20182015 where we actually had slightly favorable development in the \u201913 and \u201814 years, and consistent experience in the early part of the \u201915 year. So we're looking at the history that we have coming into the year. As we went into \u201916, we started to see a little bit of movement in the fourth quarter \u201915 and early \u201916, but still within our range of expectations. We got to the third quarter, and those periods, again fourth quarter \u201815, first two quarters of \u201916, started to elevate above the expectations. Hence, we took the activity and the actions that we did last quarter. And this quarter, as we look at all of those periods. Again, now we\u2019re looking at the end of \u201915, early first three quarters of \u201916, and obviously, now another quarter of data. We saw a continuation in that trend that was accelerating. And we took what we think was the appropriate management\u2019s best estimate, given all of those factors. And we feel good about it but there\u2019re certainly no guarantees that we can see what's going to happen next quarter. I mean, Michael, if you want to?\nMichael Klein: Yes, I think, that's exactly right. I think it's a combination of additional development on the periods that we saw before, and an additional quarter\u2019s worth of data that again reflects the fact that that adverse development continues through the end of the year. And we've made our best estimate based on the information Brain just described.\nKai Pan: My full-up on auto side again is that, if you look at this growth 13% year-over-year is actually accelerated from the last few quarters. As you increase price, do you think that one coming down? And do you think that 2 points of these are new business penalty impact will be smaller in 2017?\nMichael Klein: Thanks Kai, this is Michael. I would say a couple of things, and let me give you a little bit of the moving part underneath this growth in the fourth quarter. We do expect, as we put rate into the marketplace and put additional rate into the marketplace, that our win rates will decline. So on the business that we quote, do we convert it? We\u2019ve actually seen, in 16 states that Brian mentioned, our win rates have come down as we put that rate into the marketplace. So, think of that as our batting average, our batting average is dropping as we put rate into the marketplace. The reason this growth is up in the fourth quarter is actually largely driven by the fact that we ended up with more as fast than we expected in the quarter, so quote growth is actually elevated. So we\u2019ve got more played appearances, if you will, but the batting average, the win rate, has actually come down in response to the rate. Again, we think some of that is timing, some of that, as we mentioned in the last quarter, the ultimate impact of the actions we take depend somewhat on the fact that we\u2019re in a competitive environment, and the impact on growth and a little bit on what happens in the marketplace. So our perception of what happened in the fourth quarter is we took rates so did the market. The rate impacted our batting average, but the rate also drove business into the market, which drove that quote growth. So the PIF growth is really a quote growth story, not a conversation rate story. In terms of your question about expectations, as we looked ahead, our actions are focused on two things; improving profitability and managing growth. And we expect, that\u2019s why I give you a little bit of analog for 2017 rate looking ahead into the first quarter, we would expect rate will rise and growth will drop as we look into first quarter. What ultimately happens will depend on how those actions play out in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Newsome: I wanted to switch the question onto the commercial business a little bit. And I was wondering if you could give just a little bit more color on the pricing environment in the domestic insurance business. And it's a little bit tough to read the tealeaves. But is it better or is it worse? Is there really any change from a competitive perspective in that business?\nBrian MacLean: Paul, this is Brian. I will start, I\u2019m sure there will be follow ups to this. But broadly speaking, we feel good about the trends that we see. When you look across the data on the renewal book, we continue to see some, albeit modest, but pretty consistent improvement in what we\u2019re seeing. And we\u2019re encouraged by that. We think that might be somewhat reflection of the market. But fundamentally, I think it\u2019s a reflection of our execution. Our strategy on our portfolio remains incredibly consistent, and that is to look at in on a very granular or account-by-account or class-by-class basis. And simplistically, for the really well performing business, keep it at the best price that we can keep it at and the appropriate price, and then work hard at improving the rest of the portfolio. And when we look at that granular level, we feel really good about the momentum and also feel good about the aggregate statistics. So directionally we feel positive.\nAlan Schnitzer: Paul, it's Alan. I would add to that that it's not just a market dynamic, it's in our execution dynamic. It's a very granular, as Brain said, account-by-account class-by-class. And I think in some respects and importantly it's the franchisee value we bring to the marketplace. So we look at an account and we figure out what we need to do to achieve the written objectives that we have. And I would say probably speaking we've been speaking.\nPaul Newsome: How closely does the commercial auto business, or has the commercial auto business, track the results of the private passenger auto?\nAlan Schnitzer: Paul, I'd say that we see a lot of the same trends in the businesses. There are different businesses. They have different starting points. The coverages aren\u2019t exactly the same; for example, on the personal line side, you've got uninsured and under insured motors, that's not such a factor on the commercial side. So I would say, broadly speaking, the trends are consistent. We see consistency across them. But the results don\u2019t actually come out the same for a whole host of reasons.\nPaul Newsome: So we haven\u2019t seen the severity issue even at a level in the\u2026\nAlan Schnitzer: No, I wouldn\u2019t think we haven\u2019t seen it. We have seen. It has impacted recent years. We see a lot of the same trends. But on the auto side, it's largely private passenger. On the commercial side, you've got a lot of trucking. So you've got different dynamics there. Also it just manifests itself differently. And on the commercial side, I mean on the personal line side, auto was obviously a bigger contributor to the segment more in terms of volume, so it just manifests itself more prominently. On the BI side, obviously, commercial auto is a smaller piece of whole, so it manifests itself differently. So we do see very consistent trends across books.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry Greenberg: So, I want to go back to the auto. And I appreciate that you think it's mostly environmental on top of the 10 year issue. But I guess I just want to challenge you a bit on it. And just question, whether you think it's fair to say that maybe you picked up on some of these environmental factors later than some of the others did. And if you agree with that, why do you think that's the case? And I kind of say this in the context of, when you were growing rapidly in auto and before you picked on the BI trends, I know you talked about being keenly focused on what was driving that growth. So I'm just curious on your thoughts on all that.\nBrian MacLean: Larry, this is Brain. And I'll start with, there\u2019s a lot in your question. And we do believe it's a fundamentally environmental issue. We would never say it is definitively exclusively an environmental issue. As I think I said last quarter as I'm sure I said last quarter, Quantum 2 is a relatively new product that we\u2019re working now. And accordingly we are very atoned to looking at how it is performing and always looking to improve it. I would not agree with your statement that we are late to seeing the fundamental trend of what's going on in bodily injury severity. And without doing a long history, you can go back 2011, 2012, 2013, we were talking about this a lot, distractive driving and speeds are not brand new things, and we were talking about it then. We got to \u201913 and talked about a elevated level of bodily injury, and we were hoping that that would remain pretty constant. And we went through about two year period, 2013, 2014 into 2015, where we saw very constant, again elevated levels but constant with our expectations, of what we were getting in bodily injury. In fact, 2014 has developed favorably and we continue to see that. And what we are talking about now is another increase in that trend. And we\u2019re talking about very, very recent accident periods, and looking at the data and responding, I think pretty quickly. And so I think there is a bunch of things. Further on the comment of, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s not Quantum 2. We\u2019re sure it\u2019s not exclusively Quantum 2, because when we look across our business the same fundamental trends are in the legacy book of business, are in the Quantum 1 book of business, are in the Quantum 2 book of business, are in the business insurance business. It\u2019s in industry data. It\u2019s without the carriers. So it\u2019s not exclusively a Quantum issue. With that said, we are very granularly looking at how that product is performing, state-by-state sell-by-sell and reacting. So, I know that, and that\u2019s this probably sounding way more defensive than I should, but it\u2026\nAlan Schnitzer: The one thing I would add to that, Larry its Alan. The profile of the business that we\u2019re attracting, we actually like it. We look at the profile of all the business coming in, and if we didn\u2019t like that profile, we would have the defending answers for you. But fundamentally, we like it. We just like it at a higher base rate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: One, I guess, question on the actual quarter. There was a slowdown in exposure unit growth within the middle market. I was hoping you could talk to that a little bit?\nBrian MacLean: There is nothing fundamental in terms of trends changing there. There is always going to be some normal volatility from quarter-to-quarter and things that drive the exposure. But there is really nothing fundamental that we would identify as a trend.\nMeyer Shields: So not related to the improving renewal rate changes?\nBrian MacLean: No.\nMeyer Shields: And then more broadly speaking, when you look at the targeted after tax returns, would a change in tax rate change what you\u2019re targeting?\nAlan Schnitzer: It\u2019s an interesting question. And I guess instead of answering that specific question, let me just back-up because my guess is there is a lot of questions on the call in terms of change administration, macro environment, how it\u2019s going to change, a lot of different things. And so maybe I\u2019ll just back-up. We are very return focused in the way we think about this business. It is the lens which we evaluate just about every decision that we make. And so, we calibrate our return expectation to our cost of capital. And so there are couples of things going on that could impact cost and capital. For example, if the risk free rate goes up, cost of equity goes up. If the tax rate goes down then our after-tax cost of borrowing theoretically goes up. There could be other things in a change in tax policy. But if you just started with those two simple assumptions, you would look at that and say, gee, if the risk free rate goes up and if the tax rate goes down, you would speculate that our overall cost of capital would go up. If our overall cost of capital went up then our return objectives would go up with it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Meredith: Couple of questions here, just first on the personal lines, do you think that the rate actions you are taking on auto insurance will have an impact on homeowners growth here going forward?\nMichael Klein: I think that's possible. We've certainly talked about the fact that our auto growth has -- one of the benefits of our auto growth has been growth in home. That said, we\u2019re doing what we can to mitigate that impact. And we've got specific actions we're taken from an agency management and a distribution standpoint and in another areas to try to make sure that any impacts from the rate actions in auto don\u2019t have any impact on our ability to grow home. We\u2019re trying to continue the momentum that we have in the home line into 2017.\nAlan Schnitzer: In other words, they definitely co-relate. But we think -- we\u2019re hopeful there are things we can do to offset that and try to lever up the home growth.\nBrian Meredith: And then the second question here. On the domestic business insurance, we've seen your rate activity modestly increase the last several quarters. Is that a trend we should continue? And are you getting to a point now where you\u2019re saying all right, can't let the underlying loss ratio deteriorate anymore on an underwriting year basis?\nAlan Schnitzer: I know this won't be totally satisfying, but I think we need to go back to the answer we gave, which is we look at the accounts that are up for renewal every quarter and we try to figure out what we need to do to achieve our written objectives. And it's every single one of those transactions, or every portfolio on the flow stuff, really evaluated one at the time that rises up to that number. So, we don\u2019t think with a broad brush. We don\u2019t go out to the market and say get 1.4 points of rate in middle market. We say this is our overall return objective, and go out and execute one account or class at a time to get there. And we will when we get to the 10-K give you an outlook on RPC. So we haven\u2019t showed that yet, it will be in the 10-K when it comes out. But we never forecast on uniquely on peer rates.\nBrian Meredith: But you are forecasting for a flat underlying combined ratio for the next year. And then if I remember correctly that was part of it. But yes, there is going to be better non-cap with at least normalization and then deterioration from rate below trend, right?\nAlan Schnitzer: So the margin compression that we've had this quarter and the last few quarters has been relatively modest. And this quarter and in past quarters, it's been within other things that cause volatility in the period-over-period comparison. Most notably, this quarter and probably recent quarters weather and large losses. So, when we give you that outlook and yes we did say broadly consistent, we're certainly not measuring to the basis points, but probably consistent within a relatively narrow range. That takes into account lots of things rate, loss trend, mix, claims handling initiatives, other strategic objectives. So it really is an all-in assessment and we try not to focus too narrowly on that narrow rate loss trend. You\u2019ve got exposure in there too, contributing to margin. So, it really is a [technical difficulty] when it comes to our outlook on margin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Cohen: One more question, I guess, about the new administration. Obviously, something that\u2019s being talked about relative to taxes is a board or adjustment tax. I\u2019m wondering if you could share your thoughts on how that may affect your purchase of reinsurance from non-U.S. companies.\nAlan Schnitzer: Jay, good mornings, it\u2019s Alan let me start. It\u2019s really hard to answer that question without knowing what the board or adjustments going to look like. And we\u2019ve all read it depends on whether it\u2019s characterized as an export or an import and whether the dialogs or defaults to the new bill, and we\u2019ll see where that comes out. I think broadly speaking, as it relates to us in reinsurance, I think, our answer would be, we\u2019re by enlarge a gross line underwriter. We like our underwriting. We like to keep it. And we buy reinsurance in pretty modest amounts. And so, if there were tax adjustments that change the cost of reinsurance, obviously, we could look for alternative providers of reinsurance. We could buy a little bit less, buy a little bit more. But it would come down to evaluating the individual transaction. But I think the broader point for us is reinsurance is just isn\u2019t that big deal for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Kumar: Two quick follow up on personal auto, the first question I have is. If I go back and look at the rates that were put in place for 2016, I guess, average rate filling for in the range of, let's say 3% or so. So, when you talk about the rate filings in November, December and going forward, how should we think about that number compared to the historical 3% average number?\nAlan Schnitzer: I would say it\u2019s a pretty broad range. It depends on the state, and even there, it depends on two things; one, our experience in that state; and the rate need, but also recent rate fillings in that state right, because there is a cumulative nature to it. But certainly, it\u2019s getting bigger than what you\u2019d seen earlier in 2016. And we expect more the same during 2017 to try to close that gap of 3.5 points.\nAmit Kumar: Okay, so probably more than that. Is that a fair way to look at it?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, definitely.\nAmit Kumar: The second question and the final question I have is, you talked about 60% of your book, 16 states. You said more filings for in the pipeline. Is that immediate? Is that like a Jan-Feb thing, or is that more spread out versus the actions taken in the past?\nMichael Klein : Amit, this is Michael. I would just to clarify the comment. So the comment was 60% of our quote volume. So, again think of that as that\u2019s a new business statistics, right. So, the 16 states that we filed-in so far, those represent roughly 60% of our new business quote volumes; not exactly the same as 60% of the book, just a point of clarification. I would say the majority of the rest of the states have rate filings plan for the first quarter. And so broadly speaking, we will have made rate filings in the majority of the states where we have the auto product by the end of the first quarter. We also have additional rate actions planned for later in the year. And that obviously is all subject to regulatory approval and regulatory constraints to the timing and the amount. But I would say the first round ought to be in market by late in the first quarter, and then we've got follow-up actions on the drawing board as we look into the remainder of 2017.\nAmit Kumar: I think that's very helpful. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Tunis: My first question, I guess, just for Brain, and it's on the new business penalty. It doesn\u2019t sound like the thinking has really changed on the impact to the new business penalty. I guess, even though the environments revealed it-self to be a bit more of an issue maybe than we thought a couple of quarters ago. Just what gives you confidence, I guess, to continue to compartmentalize the BI severity versus the new business drag, especially when you think about the fact that a pretty good size of the book is new business? And I guess along those lines, if there so is a big 10 year impact, why wouldn\u2019t we assume that a lot of that strain alleviate itself in 2017 with the growth pull-back?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, so a couple of things. So I think of the 10 year impact as being discreet from the bodily injury trend. And so the 10 year impact is just the math of the maturing of the book of business. And in fact where it goes in 2017 is a function somewhat of what growth rates do. It will likely increase in 2017 slightly, as the growth that we've seen in the back half of 2016 earns through the business. But I think of the 10 year impact is more of just the arithmetic of. I don\u2019t think of it is a new business penalty as in a BI where you\u2019re pricing differently.\nMichael Klein: Yes, I think, and again I think it's, this is Michael. I would say just to reinforce what Brain said. When we talk about the 10 year effect, what we\u2019re really trying to do is just isolate the impact on the loss ratio from the relative age of the business, if you will, right. How tenured it is? What renewal it is at? And as Brain said, it's essentially a mathematical exercise that estimate what that component is or was. And then the rest of it, the environmental turn that we talked about the 3.5 points that's in the full year loss ratio, is absolutely the gap that we\u2019re actively working to close. What we do in the meantime is we monitor the performance of the tenuring and try to isolate that, and make sure that that is developing as we expected. And that analysis has remained relatively consistent, and is why we continue to have that same 2% estimate a quarter later.\nRyan Tunis: And then a couple of quick ones for Jay Benet, first on the workers comps and general liability, just curious the accident years and those reserve releases. And also just getting color on how new money yields have changed, I guess, today versus the end of the third quarter? Thanks.\nJay Benet: As it relates to the accident year question, it's really spread amongst a number of accident years. We, in the past in our disclosures have said, at times, it's related to accident years X and Y. And when we\u2019re preparing disclosures this time, the laundry list of accident years was exceptionally long and we just said why don\u2019t we just say what it relates to. So, there isn\u2019t any particular accident year for either one of them, it's just spread amongst various ones. As it relates to the new money yields, just looking up some stats as it relate, let\u2019s say -- we generally tend to focus on the ten year treasury. So, if you look at where the 10 year treasury was at the end of September, it was 1.6 and ended December 2.45. And spreads moved in that time frame as well. So I think you could look at the public data as so what to place, but a considerable rise in interest rates from one period to the next. Bill, do you want to add something?\nBrian MacLean: I thought I might add a little. Obviously, the question goes to at what point will new money yields exceed maturing yields. And obviously, the actions before this quarter gets us close to that point. But we\u2019re not yet where we need to be. We\u2019ve done a fair amount of work on it in the last few weeks, and using a whole bunch of assumptions, which would take long times really. We think that where taxable is being replaced by taxables, we reached that point sometime in the first half of 2017; for municipals replacing municipals closer to the first half of 2019. Obviously, a lot is going to be determined by the shape of any tax legislation as a very extreme, if you needed, a revenue neutral bill and the municipal exemption itself were affected, that would be non-trivial. If corporate rates were simple, and individual rates were simply lowered and the relative value of municipal were affected then they\u2019ve already achieved it. That would be less important to us. But in the bottom line is where is, what I think you\u2019re getting at, we\u2019re not quite there yet.\nRyan Tunis: Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys.\nJay Benet: And this is Jay Benet, again. If I could just add one thing, not relating to your questions but during my remarks one of my collogues tap me on the shoulder, indicating that instead of referring back to November\u2019s filling of Form 8-K, I inadvertently said 10-K. So, we don\u2019t file a 10-K in November. We did file an 8-K about the settlement. So, I just wanted to correct the record. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: One question first on the personal auto book, as you pointed to your margin outlook for 2017. Can you talk about, I guess, the components of the expense ratio and the underlying loss ratio? The expense ratio do tick down in the Q4, so it\u2019s part of helping to get to your margin goal for next year on some kind of improvement in the expense ratio to offset potentially your continued deterioration on the loss side. Can you just take us through the components a little bit?\nAlan Schnitzer: Elyse, good morning it\u2019s Alan. I would say that we go about as far as we want to go and getting outlook. And we\u2019re pretty hesitant to start breaking it down to the component pieces. Part of our strategy, at least on the auto side, was obviously reducing expenses. And you\u2019ve seen that come through to some extent already. But going forward, we prefer not to break out the pieces.\nElyse Greenspan: And then one other question, the business insurance reserve releases picked up materially year-over-year, as well as sequentially. I know you reference it spanned numerous accident years and workers comp with GL lines. As we think about potentially an environment where we\u2019ll see higher inflation levels going forward, just wondering if you could provide some commentary surrounding the pics that you\u2019re using on some of your longer tail lines? And what give you confidence for such a high level reserve releases given the uncertainties surrounding forward inflation levels? Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, as it relates to reserving, as well as pricing and loss mix, so particularly year. We\u2019re not assuming in any of the work we do this year or in any previous years that whatever the inflation environment that currently exists. And I have to say, it's an inflation environment related to the specific drivers of losses in our product as opposed to the general level of inflation. But we never assume that things are going to stay stagnant. There is an underlying assumption that things will overtime reverts back to the mean. And as you can well imagine, there is a great deal of actuarial judgment, management judgment, as to what that means. So - and looking at the reserves as they exist today, looking at how the development patterns have manifested themselves in the lost triangles, we come up with what our best estimate is of the future payments that we will be making. And if those best estimates are lower than what the carried reserves are, we\u2019ll make adjustments for it. But it is factoring in a long-term view as to what the levels of inflation might be.\nOperator: And that's from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Gelb: I had a question on your asbestos exposure. Earlier this month, the Hartford announced an economically favorable transaction, Berkshire Hathaway, to buy retroactive reinsurance contract. The size of Hartford's exposure is very similar to Travelers\u2019, at $1.8 billion for asbestos environmental. And there's been $300 million annual pretax drag on Travelers\u2019 earnings for the past two years. I'm wondering what your thoughts are now that other companies are taking steps to address these legacy exposures?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, thanks for asking, Jay. There's nothing fundamentally novel about those transactions. And as you can imagine, we look at them from time-to-time. So far, we haven't seen terms on one of those deals that we found attractive enough to do. And I'm not sure what else to say about it.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. Thank you very much for joining us today. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation.

Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our 2016 third quarter results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our Web site at www.travelers.com, under the Investor section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chief Executive Officer; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our Web site, travelers.com. And now, Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, I need to start on a sad note this morning. This is my fourth earnings call as CEO but the first since we\u2019ve lost our friend, Jay Fishman. I know I am not alone in feeling his loss. Many of you have sent thoughts and prayers. Thank you, we appreciate it. All of us at Travelers take a great deal of comfort in knowing that we\u2019re carrying on in a culture of excellence, performance and innovation that Jay left behind. It outlives him. It\u2019s an enormous part of his legacy and we\u2019re grateful for it. To sum it up in Jay\u2019s words, we all feel remarkably fortunate to have known him and worked with him. At this point, Jay would have of course demand that we get back to work, so let\u2019s get to the results. This morning, we reported third quarter operating income of $701 million or $2.40 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Our underwriting results remain strong as reflected in a 92.9% combined ratio and our net investment income is down only slightly from the prior year quarter. Across all our businesses, the third quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies, and generally speaking underlying trends have not changed. Pricing and retention remain stable and consistent with recent trends. In our commercial businesses, retention continues to be at historic highs with positive renewal premium change. In domestic business insurance, renewal rate change has improved a little bit for two sequential quarters led by our middle market business where rate has also increased sequentially month-to-month in the quarter. Underneath that middle market, we again achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorer-performing segments. We also benefited from a mix shift in our better performing segments as the loss ratio on the retained business in those segments was better than the loss ratio on non-renewed business, the results of managing the business on a very granular level. In personal insurance, we continue to achieve strong top line growth in the quarter with continued growth in policies in force in both our agency auto and homeowners businesses. We believe that being able to deliver an account solution to our customers and agents is an important and meaningful competitive advantage. More than half of our personalized premium come from accounts for which we write both auto and home policies. When we write both the auto and the home, we can be more competitive in the pricing for our customers since it creates higher customer lifetime value for us through higher retentions and a more complete view of the risk. While we manage the profitability of the auto and home lines independently, we also manage to a portfolio return. We\u2019ll be focusing more than usual on the performance of the auto business this morning but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the all-in combined ratio for a personalized business was 94.1% for the nine months, a very good result. Turning back to consolidated results for all three segments, underwriting results for the quarter were impacted by lower levels of net favorable prior year reserve development, higher non-cat weather-related losses and in personal lines higher-than-expected losses associated with auto bodily injury. Jay Benet will have more to say about the prior year development. The higher bodily injury severity in personal auto had a $29 million after-tax impact on the current accident year, $20 million of which related to the first and second quarters, a modest impact. Brian will discuss it in more detail. I'd like to highlight that we believe that the increase in auto bodily severity is environmental and not specific to the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, as we see it across all our personal insurance auto program and in our commercial auto and trucking books. In anticipation of this trend continuing, we are addressing it through pricing and we believe that the product remains positioned to deliver target returns over time. I\u2019d also add that it\u2019s important to understand that when trends change in any part of our business and they will, what\u2019s important is having the ability to recognize it and react quickly. We believe our leading analytics give us an important advantage in this regard. In terms of net investment income, fixed income returns declined in line with our expectations and we were pleased to see an improvement in our return from the non-fixed income portfolio. All of this resulted in a very strong operating return on equity in the quarter and year-to-date. Given the continued historically low interest rate environment and the other items impacting our results this quarter, we\u2019re particularly pleased with that result. In terms of the strategy going forward, you can expect more of the same. In this low interest rate environment, we\u2019re underwriting matters more than ever. We have significant competitive advantages in our data and analytics expertise, claim and risk control capabilities and talent. Combining that with our active capital management strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns over time. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Alan. Consistent with what we had said about the first two quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter; operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5% notwithstanding their being lower than the prior year quarter. As in the first half of the year, these reductions did not result from fundamental changes in business trends, rather as Alan said, they were primarily driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher non-cat weather-related losses. Net investment income, which totaled $472 million after-tax, was down only 12 million from the prior year quarter entirely due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment on fixed income returns. Non-fixed income returns improved from recent quarters to a level that was slightly higher than the prior year quarter. We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $39 million pre-tax, down from 199 million pre-tax in the prior year quarter. The business in international insurance, net favorable development of $19 million pre-tax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experienced in GL ex-A&E for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2014 and 2015, in workers\u2019 comp for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2015 and in commercial auto for accident years 2011 and prior, partially offset by a $225 million increase to our asbestos reserves. The asbestos reserve increase related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense costs for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods. In bond and specialty insurance, net favorable development of $41 million pre-tax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in fidelity and surety for accident years 2009 through 2015, while reserve development in personal insurance which remained favorable to-date. Homeowners and other had a modest amount of unfavorable development this quarter, $21 million pre-tax primarily resulting from higher than expected loss experience for a small number of liability claims related to the 2013 and 2014 accident years. Notwithstanding this current quarter activity, the homeowners and other 2013 and 2014 accident years have developed net favorably since their inception. I should also point out that the unfavorable development in homeowners and other this quarter did not result from any change in our reserve setting philosophy or methodologies. As we\u2019ve stated in the past and in our Qs and Ks, we always book to our best estimates and we use our advanced data and analytics to respond as quickly as we can to new information. By its nature, reserve development is episodic and in lines like homeowners and other, much of it has historically related to truing up estimated losses caused by storm damage. The number of severe storms in recent reporting periods, their timing in relation to the reporting period in which they occurred, the causes and severity of the losses such as wind versus water, the actual size and extent of any hail, the actual amount of additional living expenses provided, et cetera has and will cause significant fluctuations in reserve development from period to period. And changes in levels of reserve development should not be regarded as a \u201ctrend.\u201d Ex-A&E on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development year-to-date. While CMP currently looks as if it developed unfavorably year-to-date by $37 million, as I pointed out in the second quarter, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 was subsequently determined to be CMP-related. Operating cash flows of 1.77 billion were very strong this quarter. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.8 billion and all of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $3.1 billion pre-tax or 2 billion after-tax, up from 2 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year while book value per share of $86.04 and adjusted book value per share of $78.82 increased 8% and 5%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned 755 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of 193 million and share repurchases of 562 million. And year-to-date, we returned nearly 2.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So with that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. I\u2019ll start with business in international insurance where we had another good quarter, with strong returns and production results. We were very pleased that retention remained at historically high levels while we achieved positive renewal premium change and solid new business results. Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $457 million with the combined ratio of 96.1%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.7, up 2.2 points compared to the prior year. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation and about three quarters of a point impact from loss cost trends in excess of earned pricing. These were partially offset by lower large loss activity. Turning to production, given the returns that we are generating in this segment, our focus continues to be on retention and so we\u2019re very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change was nearly 3 points including renewal rate change that was slightly positive, while we produced new business of $431 million. Turning to the individual businesses, in select, retention continued to remain strong at 82% while renewal premium change was over 5 points and we\u2019re quite pleased that new business was up 7% over the prior year. In middle market, retention of 87% remained at a historical high with renewal premium change of over 2 points. New business dollars were essentially consistent with prior year with submissions, quotes and the number of new accounts written in the quarter up. The average size of accounts written was down slightly versus last year, but we're encouraged by the increased activity. In other business insurance, on Page 12, you can see that rate and RPC both improved in the quarter and retention remains strong. New business of $124 million was down compared to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting continued disciplined underwriting for larger accounts where we don't feel that market pricing will allow us to achieve target returns. In international, we achieved 82% retention with positive renewal premium change and a 46% increase in new business volume, resulting in a 4% increase in net written premiums excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were driven by our new global construction and renewable energy groups in Lloyd's and continued success in Canada with our recently introduced personal lines auto product Optima. So all-in, a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability. Turning to bond and specialty insurance, this business continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $146 million was down from the prior year quarter driven primarily by a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 77.4 remains strong and well within our target return levels. On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were flat to the prior year. Across our management liability businesses, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up, as we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return adequate product segments. So bond and specialty results remained terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and execution in the marketplace. I\u2019ll now turn to personal insurance. Alan touched on the highlights. We once again had a solid quarter with a combined ratio of 92.9 and net written premiums reaching an all-time high of $2.2 billion. Auto continues to be the bigger factor driving the growth but homeowners\u2019 growth continues to accelerate as well, and both products generated strong retention and new business levels. We believe being a portfolio provider sets us apart in the marketplace and we remain pleased with the financial performance of the overall segment. The third quarter underlying combined ratio of 91% was impacted by an adjustment to our auto loss ratio that I'll discuss in a moment and year-to-date underlying combined ratio of 88.9 remained strong, a very good result. Looking at auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1, up about 5 points from the prior year. About 4.5 points of this increase was due to the year-to-date impact of an adjustment we made to the loss ratio related to bodily injury severity for 2016, which, for the most part, reflects higher severity in our smaller claims. About 3 points of that increase relates to the first two quarters of this year. With respect to this change, I want to emphasize a few points. First, as Alan said, we believe this is environmental in nature; that is we are seeing it across all our auto products both in personal and commercial lines. Second, what we are seeing is from the last four accident quarters and for a long tail line like auto liability, that is very recent activity. Lastly, while we have been closely watching and talking to you about auto bodily injury severity for a number of years and reflecting it in our underwriting claim, pricing and reserving, recently severity has increased to a level that\u2019s a little more than we anticipated. In response to this recent trend, we\u2019re taking the appropriate pricing actions. Looking at auto frequency, overall year-to-date 2016 frequency is generally in line with our long-term view. That said, we have seen some texture within the year. Collision frequency for the first half of the year was favorable to our long-term view while the third quarter was unfavorable. We believe the frequency volatility that we've seen in 2016 reflects normal period-to-period fluctuations. As always, we are watching the data closely and will adjust if and when appropriate. But as of now, we have not changed our long-term frequency expectations. For perspective, the net adjustments we have made year-to-date related to collision frequency have less than the $3 million after-tax unfavorable impact. Normally, we wouldn't talk about a variance this small but given the amount of recent industry discussion on the topic, we felt that disclosure would be helpful. We've also been talking to you about the impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio for a while. So let me take a few minutes to walk you through the slide on Page 19 that we've added to demonstrate the impact of tenure on a loss ratio. Exhibit 1 in the upper left illustrates the underlying dynamic that drives the impact of tenure, namely that the loss ratio of the given cohort of business improves over time as poor-performing business defects and pricing segmentation improves on the business that is retained. Moving to Exhibits 2 through 4, of course, any given calendar period consist of a number of cohorts ranging from new to multiple years of age. In these exhibits, the curved line represents loss ratio by tenure, think policy year. The vertical bars represent premium volume remaining for those years and the horizontal line is the calendar period loss ratio for all cohorts, which is a premium weighted average of the loss ratio of each cohort of business during that calendar period. Exhibit 2 demonstrates a steady state growth scenario, think base case. During periods of consistent growth, the newer cohorts blend with the older ones and the calendar period loss experience will generate the target loss ratio. Exhibit 3 illustrates the impact of a higher new business growth environment where calendar period results are more heavily influenced by the newer cohorts of business that naturally have a higher loss ratio. This drives the calendar period loss ratio higher. Exhibit 4 illustrates a return to steady state growth at the higher levels of premium volume. The balance between the older and newer cohorts improves the calendar period loss ratio returns target levels, and in addition increased volume brings additional profit dollars. So obviously these are theoretical illustrations that raise a few important questions for our business. First, what is the current impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio? And the answer is that our loss ratio is about 2 points higher than it would've been excluding this tenure impact. Second, do we believe that our Quantum Auto 2.0 product is performing as expected? And the answer to this is that it has been maturing in line with our loss ratio expectations. Of course, we manage the business at a very granular level and monitor the book across multiple dimensions. For example, loss cost, retention and other proxies of profitability such as limits profile, prior experience and insurance score. In aggregate, based on all the data we have we believe this business is on track to produce appropriate returns. We clearly realized that the product is still relatively new in the marketplace having launched late in 2013, but three years in we are very pleased with the performance. Turning to homeowners, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 78.3, although up about 7 points year-over-year due primarily to an unusually low amount of non-catastrophe weather-related losses last year. The current quarter results is in line with our expectations and we remain very pleased with the returns we're seeing in this business. So stepping back from a lot of moving pieces in the quarter, this is a franchise with a year-to-date combined ratio of 94.1% and 9% premium growth; results we feel very good about. With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. We can now start the Q&A portion please. Before we get started, if I could please ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so we can get as many people on the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKai Pan: Thank you. Good morning. First, my condolences to the Travelers\u2019 family. My first question is on the personal auto, thanks for the detailed explanation. If I look at the year-over-year, like for first nine months, the deterioration by 2.6 points underlying combined ratio, you explained about 2 points coming from new business and another point maybe coming from the rising severity re-estimates about $29 million for the first nine months. Is that the right way to think about it is that these two factors has driven the underlying combined ratio going higher? And then if you see your outlook, you\u2019re expecting actually improvements in the combined ratio into 2017. I just wonder what\u2019s that coming from; is that coming from the last track [ph], from the new business penalty going forward or anything else. Thanks.\nBrian MacLean: So, Kai, it\u2019s Brian MacLean and let me clarify just a couple of things. So the two points that I referenced in my comments are that the loss ratio is elevated. You went to the delta year-over-year. That\u2019s about one point. So if you're thinking of where our combined ratio or loss ratio is relative to what it should be without it, it\u2019s 200 basis points but the year-over-year change, only 100. Another thing that when speaking \u2013 a lot of our commentary was to loss ratio and importantly remember in this business, as we rolled out Quantum, it was really built around a pretty decent change to our cost structure. So the expense ratio is seeing some benefit and going forward will see more as volume increases. So if you're talking combined ratio, there is an expense ratio good guy in there. The basic dynamics of what you were mentioning though are the right components.\nAlan Schnitzer: Kai, it\u2019s Alan. As to the outlook, you're right. We did suggest it was going down slightly and we\u2019ve identified in the outlook three moving pieces. One, a lower level of loss activity just returning to a more normal level, rate versus trend as given our outlook for rate and loss trend and that's offset by the continued adverse impact to tenure.\nKai Pan: Okay, that\u2019s great. Then a follow-up question. Do you have any early indication from potential losses from Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter?\nAlan Schnitzer: Kai, we anticipated that and we\u2019re happy to give you an early range but I do want to indicate that we\u2019re just three weeks post storm, so it\u2019s still early for us. And it could be influenced from here through the end of the quarter by large BI claims that come up that we haven\u2019t identified yet. So we would say our range at this point is $75 million to $150 million and that\u2019s pre-tax. And again, the risk factor going forward is going to be claims that we haven\u2019t seen or don\u2019t know of yet but they could come in between now and the end of the quarter.\nKai Pan: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner of FBR. Please proceed with your question.\nRandy Binner: Good morning and thanks. I wanted to just talk on severity and just to understand what it is a little bit better. Is it that the actual injury and the bodily injury in these accidents is worse or is it a process by which claims are being used more to cover various medical conditions or is it a function of more aggressive trial bar or is it all three? I\u2019m trying to understand what it is that\u2019s actually driving the severity higher on the auto?\nAlan Schnitzer: Randy, it\u2019s Alan. I\u2019d say you got it right sort of across the board. Generally speaking, we are seeing a high level of severity generally in the smaller claims and it\u2019s a little bit more aggressive litigation and a little bit more complexity in those smaller cases. You can\u2019t turn on the TV without seeing some kind of advertisement from the trial bar, so it\u2019s hard to pinpoint it with a high degree of specificity, but generally all those things.\nRandy Binner: Maybe the follow up then is you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing it across your commercial and personal auto book in small case, if I got that right. So is it \u2013 what\u2019s the similarity across the classes and is it more people being involved in accidents, is that a piece of it too?\nAlan Schnitzer: In some cases, there are more accidents of the vehicles and in some cases that is driving it. And generally we can just tell you that we see the same phenomenon across both books, commercial and personal.\nRandy Binner: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks and good morning. I was wondering \u2013 the first question is, if you could better help me understand the auto BI uptake. You\u2019ve obviously cited outside environmental factors, yet there was modest re-estimation for the first half of 2016. Why would that not be a Travelers specific issue? And if you look at other companies such as Allstate and The Hartford who have had similar issues, what you have learned is this is rarely a one quarter issue. So maybe just help me understand why it\u2019s external and not internal?\nBrian MacLean: So this is Brian, let me do a couple of pieces of that. First, when we look at claim experience across our business and we see it in personal lines, in recently written business, legacy long tenured business across pretty much the entire spectrum of customer profile and we see it in our commercial business from small to large trucking, that tells that this isn\u2019t something specific to our underwriting some product we have a marketplace. So it would be in our view highly unlikely that we\u2019d see it that broad based and have it be just our issue. I would also talk to \u2013 I would completely agree with the comment that auto liability, any liability line of business, it\u2019s hard to see clarity in the near term. And so we\u2019re constantly watching these events. I am very confident though that we\u2019re as on top of this as anybody. And for reference I\u2019d say look back to commentary we had going back as far as 2011, 2012 into 2013. We were talking about liability trends, what we were seeing in the auto product relative to distracted driving relative to increased litigation relative to increased utilization of medical diagnostic tools and the impacts on bodily injury. And to be totally honest, there were a couple of years there where we were getting a lot of questions from folks on this call about why are you seeing something that no one else is talking about? And over the years, I think everybody has been talking about it. So I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019ve got it perfectly right or we ever do, but we\u2019re looking at the trends very, very closely. And what we\u2019ve seen in the last three or four accident quarters has been somewhat of an elevation, as we said, particularly on the lower end of the claim size but driving more complexity.\nAlan Schnitzer: I would also add. It didn\u2019t take us completely by surprise. Our loss PIPs [ph] had anticipated some increased severity. This was just a tick higher than we anticipated.\nAmit Kumar: My second question is in the opening comments you talked about pricing actions. Does that indicate that we should anticipate a slowdown in Quantum growth? Why or why not? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: So I\u2019m going to let Michael Klein jump in on that one.\nMichael Klein: Sure. This is Michael. I would say the impact on growth will depend upon how our pricing actions compare to those taken in the marketplace. What I can tell you and it\u2019s very incremental, but if you look at the production statistics on the webcast, you\u2019ll see our pricing rise quarter-over-quarter relative to where we were in 2015, and yet the growth has increased. So our view of where we sit currently is while we have taken some price increases above where we were running, our competitive position so far has actually remained consistent, if not improved and you\u2019re seeing actually increased growth this quarter relative to the couple of quarters before. To the degree that we\u2019re right about this being environmental and we think it is, we believe the marketplace will respond and we think that our pricing actions will be sort of absorbed in the market. Could it have an impact on growth, it certainly could. But again, to the degree we think it\u2019s environmental we think we\u2019ll be in line what\u2019s going on in the marketplace.\nAmit Kumar: Just a quick follow up to that. Would it actually be prudent to say we\u2019re trying to get a better handle on this issue, let\u2019s just pull back on growth? Let\u2019s get this piece right and then come back on the growth trajectory?\nMichael Klein: What I would say to that is we are addressing what we\u2019re seeing with our pricing actions and focused on making sure we\u2019ve got the right price in the marketplace. The growth will be what it will be as a result, but our focus is on getting the right terms and conditions in the market to respond to this change that we\u2019ve just seen.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks\u2026\nAlan Schnitzer: That\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re trying to get the right price on the right account. And based on that and the market reaction will determine the degree to which we grow.\nAmit Kumar: I\u2019ll stop here. Thank you for the answers.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Good morning. First on the personal auto book as well, when you guys think about your margin outlook in Q4 and into 2017, what type of increase in rates are you expecting from what we saw in the third quarter? And then as we think about the margin in the fourth quarter, I guess given the fact that you added to the current accident year, should we look for a sequential improvement in the auto underlying margin? And then one other, you guys did mention adding to the four recent accident quarters, so was there prior year adverse development on the auto book for 2015?\nAlan Schnitzer: So that was a lot and quickly, so let me try to address what I caught and then maybe I\u2019ll ask you to repeat what we didn\u2019t get to. So I think you asked for the outlook on rate in auto. We don\u2019t give outlook on rate. We do provide outlook on overall price. And so I think you\u2019ll see that generally we are forecasting an increase in renewal price change, which is all-in rate and exposure. We don\u2019t quantify it any more than that other to say an increase. And I\u2019m sorry, Elyse, what were the other questions?\nElyse Greenspan: Well, I was looking \u2013 You guys had mentioned adding to the auto losses for the four most recent accident quarters, so were there adverse development on 2015?\nAlan Schnitzer: There was a very little bit of adverse in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s obviously in the overall net PYD number, but it\u2019s a very small think after-tax single-digit number.\nGabriella Nawi: Elyse, it\u2019s Gabby. I think if I\u2019ve understood your question correctly on the current year prior quarter addition, it was 30 million pre-tax related to the first six months and then there was roughly \u2013 which means 15 million a quarter, which continued in the third quarter\u2019s '16 and can then use in the fourth quarter '16. Is that your question?\nAlan Schnitzer: I interpreted your question to be, is there anything in prior year development related to this?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes, that was the question.\nAlan Schnitzer: And the answer to that is in the overall net number of prior year developments, there is a single digit after-tax million dollar number in the fourth quarter.\nMichael Klein: This is Michael Klein, offset by other items so there is no adverse prior year development in auto. That number is zero.\nAlan Schnitzer: And there always is in PYD over the various accident years if you\u2019re going one way or another and the aggregate of those things was zero.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then one, if I may switch topics a little bit, in terms of your commercial line pricing view, with inflation levels looking like they could be picking up and reserved cushions for you guys and maybe some others starting to slow overall for the industry, do you think that it\u2019s time that some companies look to take price to kind of get ahead of the infection point if current trends continue as they are?\nAlan Schnitzer: It\u2019s hard to answer that. I certainly can\u2019t answer that question for anybody else. You can see what our pricing has done and in our pricing, the headline number you see is really the aggregate of the many thousands of transactions that we complete during the quarter. And you can see that it picked up a little bit. I will tell you that generally speaking, we feel like we are achieving the written margins that we\u2019re seeking to achieve today and feel pretty good about their product returns given where the tenure is. We do give you some outlook in the 10-Q for underwriting margins. So we\u2019ll see where the market goes.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Gelb: Thanks very much. On the excess capital position for the company, clearly Travelers continues to buy back stock and increase its dividend, although that pace of capital return has slowed for the year-to-date compared to the same period in 2015. I\u2019m trying to get a perspective on how much excess capital you feel Travelers holds now in excess of rating agency requirements?\nJay Benet: Hi, Jay. This is Jay. You\u2019ve asked the question in the past and when we go back to what we\u2019ve said at those times as well as in our Qs and Ks, ultimately it\u2019s going to be the earnings level of the company that\u2019s going to drive how much we return to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As it relates to the specifics of excess capital, we try to manage the operating companies of two what the rating agencies require of us as it relates to being an AA company. In any given quarter, based on profitability of that quarter, we might end up with a little extra capital. I think it\u2019s very, very rare that we end up with anything less than we need. So it\u2019s not a significant number and it\u2019s just going to vary from timing. Ultimately, we carry our rating agency capital level in line with the AA over time and we return the excess. We don\u2019t sit on the excess capital.\nJay Gelb: All right, thanks for clarifying that. Alan, on the merger and acquisition front, essentially all the growth it seems in Travelers this year is coming from personal lines with little overall top line growth in commercial insurance. Is there any interest in accelerating the commercial insurance growth through acquisitions?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Jay, we always give the same answer to that question. I can\u2019t tell you whether we will or we won\u2019t but I can tell you that I think our shareholders should demand that we have a view on what the attractive businesses are in every market that we operate in or might want to operate in and have a view on whether we won\u2019t to do them. We do think that we\u2019ve come together over a couple of decades through a lot of transactions. We feel like it\u2019s a competitive advantage for us. We\u2019re good at finding them. We\u2019re good doing the diligence. We\u2019re good at negotiating them. We\u2019re good at integrating them. So we feel highly qualified to do it and under the right terms and conditions, interested in doing it. Having said that, over the years we\u2019re also highly attentive to the risks; you buy the entire balance sheet, you buy system issues, you buy people issues. So we\u2019re very \u2013 I\u2019d say we\u2019re very aware on both sides of the analysis. But we are certainly interested in doing things if we can get them done on the right terms. And generally speaking for us, those are \u2013 we think about it through the lens of returns. Will a transaction improve our return profile and/or will it improve our volatility. And so that\u2019s the lens and we\u2019re always interested in looking.\nJay Gelb: That makes sense, Alan. Would that include large deals as well, something that might require issuing shares?\nAlan Schnitzer: Jay, I wouldn\u2019t make any distinction between a large deal and a small deal. All I can tell you is what the lens is through which we would evaluate it.\nJay Gelb: Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Sebaski: Good morning. Thanks. I guess the first one, just a follow up back on personal auto really quickly. And I guess the question\u2019s on the timing of the rate actions that you guys took and what I\u2019m trying to figure out is with regard to the growth. While the PIF growth was obviously very strong, I\u2019m wondering if the severity issues were recognized at the close of the quarter and the rating actions are going to be perspective or these were rating actions that were taken at the beginning of the quarter and the 11% PIF growth was after those rating actions took place?\nMichael Klein: Charles, this is Michael. I would say that we have been putting some rate into the market, first of all, throughout the year. The filed rate has started to rise in the quarter. I would say the growth in the quarter reflects some of that activity but just a little bit, and there\u2019s more to come.\nCharles Sebaski: Excellent. Thank you. And then a follow up on the weather and the commentary on higher losses from non-cat weather. You guys already provide a lot of detail, which is very helpful. I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us out a little further and give some kind of baseline of what weather losses are intended, I guess particularly maybe in like a homeowners line of business? I guess the commentary that losses are higher or lower in a particular period due to higher non-cat weather that isn\u2019t specific identified without a baseline is color what\u2019s hard to model or understand. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some clarity you could give on a baseline for us on what non-cat weather should be and what the volatility is that through the year?\nAlan Schnitzer: Charles, it\u2019s Alan. I do appreciate the question and why you want to know and also I\u2019d just thank you for acknowledging the fact that we do give a lot of color and texture and we try to be very thoughtful about that. This is one that we think a lot about and we think it\u2019s hard to do for a couple of reasons. One is, weather is just inherently unpredictable. There\u2019s a lot of volatility obviously and we don\u2019t know. We do have a plan. We do price for weather, but that reflects generally speaking longer term trends. So we just don\u2019t feel like it would be particularly meaningful for us to give you a plan for next quarter or next year just given the volatility. So we shy away from getting that specific relative to our expectations. But what I will tell you in case it\u2019s helpful is one a year-to-date basis for the company, weather was about \u2013 non-cat weather was about $70 million worse after-tax than it was in the prior year. So I know that\u2019s not exactly what you asked for. Maybe that\u2019s a little bit of color that would be helpful. But we\u2019re just a little bit hesitant to start giving you plan numbers.\nCharles Sebaski: I appreciate the answers. Thanks a lot, guys.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nMichael Nannizzi: Thanks so much. Just back to auto for a second, if I could. Is it possible to kind of understand where the action quarter loss ratio is here at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or just post these adjustments that you made to the current calendar year in the third quarter? And then where is that relative to kind of where you wanted that business to be running when the sort of Quantum 2.0 effort began?\nAlan Schnitzer: I guess we\u2019re looking at each other trying to understand exactly what it is you\u2019re asking. If you\u2019re looking for a view on fourth quarter, we\u2019re not really inclined to give any information about the fourth quarter yet.\nMichael Nannizzi: How about where did the third quarter end? In terms of \u2013 so you made the adjustments to the third quarter, so I would imagine if you\u2019re thinking about your prospective trend then you\u2019re going to start with the third quarter, you\u2019re going to look at rate and then you\u2019re going to look at loss. I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of what\u2019s your starting point for new business today?\nAlan Schnitzer: Stepping back, if you look at it on the nine months and you look at PI auto, the underlying combined ratio was about 98. Is that helpful?\nMichael Nannizzi: Yes.\nAlan Schnitzer: That\u2019s for the nine months in PI and that\u2019s on an underlying basis ex-cat and ex-PYD.\nMichael Nannizzi: Okay. And so that\u2019s in our numbers. Has that changed throughout the year or is that just kind of back to shareholders?\nMichael Klein: Michael, this is Michael. I would just say, so for context on that underlying right, Brian talked about the fact that there\u2019s a point of impact from tenure year-on-year in that number. The other thing is if you take the bodily injury severity number and decompose that 45 million by quarter, it\u2019s about 1.5 on a run rate basis for the year-to-date. That 1.5 we expect to go forward into the fourth quarter. And the other thing I would say, just clarification on the fourth quarter outlook, the fourth quarter outlook says that we expect the combined ratio to be higher in the fourth quarter. There is a seasonality impact underneath that number, right. The combined ratio and the loss ratio in the fourth quarter run higher in the fourth quarter than they do in the first three quarters of the year. And so that\u2019s part of what\u2019s underneath that outlook number as well.\nMichael Nannizzi: Got it. I guess one question I have, Quantum is \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s been very effective in a lot of ways. We\u2019ve seen PIF growth, the acceptance in the market, all of those things seem like a real positive. And then we have the sort of environmental trend that has been occurring like fits and spurts over the last couple of years. So taking those things separately, is it possible that the growth that you\u2019ve seen just might have occurred at a difficult time sort of before some of these loss trends emerged? And following up on a prior question, should that imply that at some point we should see that growth revert back until you calibrate those things, or is this still within your sort of expectations when you rolled out Quantum?\nAlan Schnitzer: So let\u2019s go back a few years to where we were three or four years ago or two or three years ago when this business was shrinking in double digits. So we put Quantum Auto in and we took a lot of cost out, and we\u2019ve dramatically improved the overall profile of the business. So we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that. This has been a big success. And a lot of the growth you\u2019re seeing is high in percentage terms, because it\u2019s off a smaller base after a couple years of shrinking. So, that\u2019s I think just important context to keep in mind. We don\u2019t go out there and try to manage the growth. We try to go out there based on everything that we see and price for the return that we\u2019re looking for. And based on the market, we\u2019ll grow or we won\u2019t grow. We feel very good about the growth. Maybe we don\u2019t have it exactly right, maybe we\u2019ll have to adjust, I\u2019m not really sure and honestly we could be adjusting up or down, not really sure. And this isn\u2019t unusual for any line of business that we have. As I said before, cost trends are going to change for one reason or another. We\u2019ve got other trends in other parts of our business that have emerged favorably. And so we watch these things, we think having the diagnostics and the ability to understand it, to diagnose it, to price for it is what\u2019s really important.\nMichael Nannizzi: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Cohen: Thank you. I guess we hit most of the issues on the auto side. Can you give us an update on the workers\u2019 comp business? It feels like it\u2019s been relatively stable. Are you seeing any changes in that environment, either pricing or claims?\nAlan Schnitzer: I would say continued stable environment, no real change in the trends. Obviously, we had a couple of court cases in Florida that the overall market has reacted to and we\u2019ve reacted to. Those dollars weren\u2019t enormous for us. I think last year we had something on the order of $34 million, $35 million pre-tax that we added the reserves for those two court cases, so relatively minor for us. But other than that, no real trends from workers\u2019 comp.\nJay Cohen: Great. Thanks, Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on thinking about the BI severity on the commercial auto side. It sounds like you guys are flagging this as an environmental issue kind of across all the wheels business. Is there a way that you can maybe help us think about the impact that had year-over-year on the loss ratio in commercial just from the severity in commercial auto?\nAlan Schnitzer: Ryan, what I\u2019ll tell you is on the business insurance side, the proportion of premium that comes from auto is just much smaller than the same is true for the PI segment. So overall, the numbers are just less significant to that segment. There were some small numbers but nothing all that significant. The other thing I\u2019d point out is on the commercial line side, we have more flexibility to change pricing more quickly than we do on the personal line side.\nBrian MacLean: The other thing I would add, Ryan, this is Brian is when you really look at the commercial exposure, when you\u2019re thinking of smaller claims that could be more of a PI thing. So the actual \u2013 we did have some activity on the severity side in BI this quarter. The dollars were actually less than PI. Obviously, as Alan said, the percentage was dramatically less. We actually had a little bit of good news from frequency in the current year; again, small dollars. So you don\u2019t see the impact as much, so a bunch of different factors going into it.\nRyan Tunis: Okay, understood. And then I guess a follow up for Brian, I guess, on the impact of tenure. So I guess over the last couple years, it\u2019s been 2 points. If we would have had this conversation a year ago, it would have been 1. So the new business penalty I guess has grown year-over-year. And I guess this introduces the question of just how and over what time period can we really get that 2 points back? I guess especially when you think about the fact that Quantum 2, it seems like it\u2019s supposed to be a more competitively priced product. So over time, there should be a higher percentage of premium in new business. Just anything you can give us on getting that 2 points back, and whether or not you can get it back and keep growth anywhere close to where it is for Quantum? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, so a couple of things and again this is back to the theoretical example. Although not possible, if you keep growing \u2013 you keep trying to chasing it, but if you keep growing with business that you believe has lifetime value that\u2019s meeting your returns, then it\u2019s all a good thing. And I get that that\u2019s a theoretical comment. We\u2019re not going to disclose exactly what the timing is, because that would lead someone to be able to triangulate exactly how we\u2019re pricing in the returns that we\u2019re \u2013 specific returns we\u2019re targeting. But the answer is, it\u2019s kind of a function of what do you think is going to happen to our growth. It\u2019s not going to reverse in the next year or two. It\u2019s going to take a while to play out. The other thing that is certainly worth noting is we talk a lot about the ratio. As we grow and it performs, we\u2019re generating profit dollars that are incremental to the franchise and obviously that\u2019s a good thing.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning. In the Q, you provide guidance that the personal auto combined ratio on an underlying basis could improve in 2017. What are your assumptions in terms of the auto BI severity there? Do you assume any further uptick or is that a risk?\nMichael Klein: This is Michael. I would say what we\u2019ve said is that auto severity uptick is about 1.5 on a run rate basis. We assume that continues on a go-forward basis. There\u2019s always a risk it could change from here, it could change up, it could change down. When you look at the outlook, the outlook reflects the comments we\u2019ve made this morning that we\u2019re responding with price, and so the outlook I think literally says we believe price will exceed loss trend, which will be a good guy. The outlook says I believe that offsets some continued adverse impact from tenure. And then the other big component is an expectation about more normalized loss levels, which relates a little bit to the non-cat weather conversation we\u2019ve been having this morning and just a broader more consistent expectation on the loss level. So, again, I think the pricing and the outlook anticipate that the bodily injury severity, the higher levels of bodily injury severity are with us going forward but we\u2019re responding with price and believe that we\u2019ll get price ahead of loss trend in '17.\nSarah DeWitt: Great. Thanks for the answer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: This will be our last question. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our last question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg of Janney. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry Greenberg: Thanks and good morning. And just about all my questions were answered, but I have one nerdy one. In the bond line \u2013 were you waiting for that, Gabby?\nGabriella Nawi: No, it\u2019s just it\u2019s such a great business and nobody ever ask questions. If we can inadvertent cheer for [indiscernible].\nLarry Greenberg: The underlying loss ratio improved a few points. And I\u2019m just wondering, was there any re-estimation of the first half here similar to what you did a year ago in the third quarter?\nAlan Schnitzer: There was a re-estimation in the quarter, yes, and it was an improvement loss ratio of 2.3 points. And so that\u2019s when you pull the first two quarters back in and add what\u2019s into the third quarter. So, yes, that\u2019s correct.\nLarry Greenberg: Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you all for joining. And as always, we\u2019re available for follow-up question and answer in Investor Relations, and we\u2019ll be speaking with a number of you in the next few days. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference call for today.

Welcome to the Second Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 21, 2016. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Tina. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our 2016 second quarter results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investor section. Speaking today will be: Alan Schnitzer, CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. They will discuss the financial results of our businesses and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. In addition, other members of senior management are in the room, including Bill Heyman, Vice Chairman and Chief Investment Officer; Michael Klein, Executive Vice President and President, Personal Insurance; Tom Kunkel, Executive Vice President and President, Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Greg Toczydlowski, Executive Vice President and President of Business Insurance. Before I turn it over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks and responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website. And now, Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter operating income of $649 million or $2.20 per share, and an operating return on equity of 11.6%. Our underwriting results remained strong, as reflected in our 93.1% combined ratio for the quarter, despite the impacts of higher catastrophe and non-cat weather-related losses year-over-year. For the six months, we reported operating income of $1.35 billion or $4.52 per share, and an operating return on equity of 12%. Given the cumulative impact of years and years of declining interest rates on our investment portfolio and also relative to the fresh lows in the risk-free rate, we feel terrific about the returns we continue to generate. Our expertise in risk selection and pricing, our thoughtful and consistent investment strategy and our active approach to capital management all come together to enable us to achieve our objectives of delivering superior returns and creating shareholder value. Turning to production, the second quarter was another example of the successful execution of our market place strategies. We are very pleased with the record volume of premium that we wrote in the quarter and we continue to be very pleased with the amount of returns in the business we\u2019re writing. In our commercial businesses, retentions remained high and renewal premium change was positive. Underneath that, consistent with our very granular approach to execution, in middle market, we retained 90% of the premium from our best-performing accounts with only a modest decline in renewal rate change on that business. On our poor-performing accounts, we achieved renewal rate change in excess of loss trend. You might have noticed that renewal rate change in domestic business insurance was slightly positive as compared to slightly negative in the first quarter, and renewal rate change in middle market improved by four point, we don\u2019t forecast rate and we\u2019re not calling a bottom, but the significance of this to us is that the market remains remarkably stable and we\u2019re generally successful in achieving our written objectives. In terms of new business, we are actively seeking and finding opportunities that meet our return thresholds, and we delivered strong new business growth in our commercial businesses, including 10% growth in new business and domestic business insurance. In personal insurance, net written premiums grew 9% to a record of over $2.1 billion, with accelerating momentum in both auto and homeowners. New business was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the success of the Quantum product. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our financial expectations and is successfully enhancing our market position. Our success in the market place across all our businesses really speaks to the value of the talent that we have in the home office and in the field, and their ability to leverage our data and analytics and work with our distribution partners to deliver great products and services and fair prices to our customers. Franchise value matters. Before I turn the call over to Jay Benet, I\u2019d like to acknowledge and thank all of our colleagues in the Claim organization for their extraordinary efforts and handling the claims of our customers, affected by severe weather and fire so far this year. These experts are on the frontline for us delivering on the promise we extend with every policy that we write and it has been a very active year so far for them. Their responsiveness and expertise are great to our customers and an important competitive advantage for us. In Canada, where we saw significant wild fires in the Fort McMurray area, both our customers and we benefited from the work we\u2019ve done to replicate our US claim model, which enables us to respond to large scale events with our own highly-trained professionals and resources without resorting to independent adjustors. So, all in all, solid results for the quarter and the first half, particularly in light of the weather and wildfires and continued excellent execution in the market place. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over Jay Benet.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I\u2019d like to start by saying that we were pleased with our results. Operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they\u2019re being lower than in the prior-year quarter. These reductions did not result from significant changes in underlying business trends, notably as indicated on page four of the webcast. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating income was impacted by among other things, PCS, cat events and lower fixed income, net investment income. Losses from PCS cat events was met or exceeded our threshold for recording as cat, which is $79 million higher after tax than in the prior-year quarter, while losses from PCS cat events has gone below our cap thresholds which we recorded as part of non-cat weather related losses within underlying underwriting results for $56 million higher after tax than in the prior-year quarter. And fixed income NII was $21 million lower after tax, primarily due to the continuing the low interest rate environment as we had anticipated in the outlook section of our first quarter 2016 10-Q. Everything else was pretty much a wash. We continued to experience net favorable prior-year reserve development, which totaled $288 million pretax or $192 million after tax this quarter, up from $207 million pretax or $133 million after tax in the prior-year quarter. The business in International Insurance, net favorable development of $138 million pretax or $94 million after tax, primarily resulted from better than expected loss in domestic workers comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2015. Better than expected loss experience in domestic general liability for accident years 2011 and 2015 and better than expected loss experience in our European operations partially offset by an $82 million pretax of $53 million after tax increased through environmental reserves. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $150 million pre-tax or $98 million after tax, primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in Fidelity and Surety for accident years 2010, 2013 and 2014, and better than expected loss experience in GL for accident years 2007 through 2011. Year-to-date, on a combined-stat basis, for all of our US subs, all accidents years have developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines have developed favorably year-to-date. While CMP developed unfavorably by $42 million year-to-date, you may recall me telling you in the first quarter that there was an offsetting favorable development in the Property product line, as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the Property line at year-end 2015 was subsequently determined to be CMP-related. Operating cash flows of $443 million were very strong, particularly recognizing that they were net off the $524 million payment we made this quarter as final settlement of the PPG asbestos litigation. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.75 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains increased to approximately $3.6 billion pre-tax or $2.3 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $85.73 and adjusted book value per share of $77.61 increased 7% and 3%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $747 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, through dividends of $197 million and share repurchases of $550 million. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve retuned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the microphone over to Brian, there is one additional topic I'd like to cover, our cap reinsurance coverage. In addition to our corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty, which we renewed at the beginning of the year, our cap reinsurance includes cap bonds that are specific to the Northeast US along with the Northeast Gen Cat Treaty. With respect to the cat bonds, one, that had provided up to $300 million of coverage for certain losses, expired as scheduled in May 2016, and given our current risk profile, we decided not to replace it. With respect to the remaining cat bond, which will not expire until May 2018, the attachment point and maximum limit will reset as required annually to adjust the model\u2019s expected loss of the layer within the predetermined range. For the year beginning May, 16, 2016, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond as losses in the covered area for single occurrence reaching additional attachment amount of $1.968 billion. The full $300 million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum $2.468 billion. And finally, our Northeast Gen Cat Treaty was renewed on July 1. This treaty provides up to $800 million, part of $850 million of coverage, subject to $2.25 billion retention. The certain losses arising from hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms, earthquakes, and winter storm or freeze losses from Virginia to Maine. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage including a description of earthquake and international coverage is included in our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today as well as in our 2015 10-K. While the total cost of these treaties is small, in relation to our operational income, we were able to save some money by not replacing the expiring cat bond. And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. In business, the new international insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved a very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher levels of new business. Our strategy has not changed as we strive to retain our best-performing accounts, get rate where needed and write new business when it meets our target returns. This has been our strategy for some time. And as a result, we continue to be viewed as the stable and financially strong market by our distributors and customers. Along with the meaningful competitive advantages that we deliver, this consistent leadership position is resulting in additional growth opportunities for us. Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $393 million with the combined ratio of $97.5 million. Cat losses for the quarter were $143 million net after-tax, which included $61 million from the Canadian wildfires. Excluding the Canadian fires, cat losses were slightly higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior-year reserve development, was $95.5 million, up 2.4 points compared to the second quarter of 2015. The loss ratio increased by 1.7 points, driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than prior-year quarter and our expectation. The expense ratio was up seven tens of a point over last year, driven primarily by commissions as the second quarter of 2015 benefited from a one-time favorable adjustment. Net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior-year quarter with domestic business insurance premiums up about 2%. Given the returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention. And so, we were very pleased that retention remains at 85% for the quarter, renewal premium change was just over two points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive. New business of $525 million was up 10% versus the second quarter of 2015. Turning to the individual businesses within Business Insurance, beginning with select, we achieved retention of 82% and renewal premium change of nearly 6%. Rate change was down slightly versus the first quarter of 2016, while exposure was in line with recent periods and new business was up slightly year-over-year. In middle market, retention remained very strong at 87% with renewal premium change of about a point and a half, in line with recent quarters. In terms of new business opportunities, given our leadership position in the market, submissions were up year-over-year. Accordingly, we had more opportunities to quote on the types and classes of business we find attractive and to grow our new business while maintaining our return thresholds. In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up a point year-over-year, while renewal premium change was 0.5 and new business of $154 million was consistent with the second quarter of 2015. As we've mentioned in the past, Other Business insurance includes our National Property Business. While there continues to be some rate pressure in this business, returns remain attractive, and as a result, retention is our priority. As you can see, on Page 13 of the webcast, excluding National Property, renewal rate change for Other Business Insurance remains positive and was relatively consistent with recent quarters. In International, net written premiums for the second quarter were down about 12% quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 9%, driven by disciplined underwriting actions in our UK business, along with lower economic activity impacting the Marine and energy lines of our Lloyd's business. New business of $107 million was up 67% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic Personal Lines Auto product in Canada, which was modeled after our US-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product, so always a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability. I'll turn now to Bond & Specialty Insurance where we had another terrific quarter. Operating income of $202 million was up significantly from the prior-year quarter, driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 80.9% remains exceptionally strong. As for topline, net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year, as growth in Management Liability was offset by lower Surety premium. The lower Surety volume was due almost entirely to favorable one-time reinsurance impacts in the prior-year quarter. Across our Management Liability business, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up, as we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts, underwriting more business in our return adequate product segments. We continue to feel great about this segment's performance. In Personal Insurance, results were again strong and remain particularly pleased with our ability to add topline growth at appropriate financial returns. Net written premiums for the quarter up $2.1 billion were an all-time high with double-digit growth in Agency Auto, while growth also accelerated in Agency Homeowners and other. In both products, we continue to produce strong retention and new business levels. Agent and consumer receptivity to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains exceptional and importantly, as significant amount of Quantum Auto 2.0 business are now coming through their renewal cycles, we're pleased with the retention rates we're seeing on those policies. In Homeowners, our growth momentum is building due to crossover benefits from Quantum Auto 2.0, as well as pricing changes and improvements to Agent and customer experience. Turning to profitability, operating income for the segment was down compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations, but up about point from the prior year, driven by the impact of the significant new business volume in recent years and normal quarterly volatility in weather and other loss activity. In Agency Auto, the 101.3 combined ratio included 2.7 points in cash, primarily resulting from hail storms. Weather also impacted the underlying combined ratio with 1.7 points of non-cat weather-related losses, which is approximately one point higher than both our expectations and the second quarter of 2015. The remaining increase in the underlying combined ratio was driven by the high levels of new business that I just mentioned. As we've noted before, the Quantum Auto 2.0 business is priced to our long-term target returns and loss experiences performing in-line with our expectations. Turning to Agency Homeowners and other, underlying financial results remain strong. The second quarter underlying combined ratio of 78.2% is well within our target return levels as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. So overall, for Personal Insurance, we feel great about the growth in the financial returns that the business is generating. Before I turn it back to Gabby, I would like to take a moment to recognize Doreen Spadorcia who announced her retirement from Travelers' effective September 1st of this year. Over the past 30 years, Doreen has played an important role on our management team, and we wish her well as she enjoys a new chapter of her life. With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Brian. Tina, we are now ready to start the Q&A portion of the call if I could ask the participants to limit yourself to one question and 1 follow-up, please. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Randy Binner of FBR and Co. Please go ahead.\nRandy Binner: Hey, Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to talk about the underlying combined ratio in business and international. And I think in the comments and in the press release, you attributed the increase of 2.4% to non-cat weather, but as well as loss cost not being covered by earned pricing. And so, I think - can we get more granular on that, because we\u2019re at a point in the cycle where not covering loss cost with earned trend is potentially an issue and just wanted to get a better detail on that.\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure, Randy, it's Alan, I'll take that. So the underlying combined ratio in that segment, you're right, was down 2.4 points. Part of that was commission and that was a year-over-year comparison thing, nothing going on there. The other piece of that was in the loss ratio, the majority of that does come from non-cat weather. There is a relatively small piece of earned rate versus loss trend coming through. And one of the reasons we showed you Page four in the webcast was to try to put that in a little bit of context. So really what's impacting year-over-year is the weather. You get, as we said before, we tried to make clear that rate and loss trend is one small piece of what goes on, but there is also taxes, expenses, base year, mixed - the impact of changes in claim handling, things like that. Everything else, as we would've expected was a wash. So, there is nothing in that that earned rate versus loss trend that was surprising to us or that we think shouldn't had been evident from the return information we\u2019ve provided over the last year or so.\nRandy Binner: Is that - is the piece of it, though, that's the loss trend versus earned pricing, is that - I think you're saying that it\u2019s not surprising you, but it does seem to be changing, is it a bigger piece of the equation than it has been in the last few quarters?\nAlan Schnitzer: It\u2019s the earned impact of what we\u2019ve been disclosing is written over the past year. So it's earning in as we would've expected and we called it out just in the interest of transparency. But again, nothing that surprises us and given where our return and earned returns are, nothing that we\u2019re not comfortable with.\nRandy Binner: And then just finally\u2026 Sorry, go ahead.\nAlan Schnitzer: I would just say - as I said in my prepared remarks, Randy, we're very comfortable with the model returns on the business we\u2019re writing, and so just to give you a little bit more context.\nRandy Binner: And then with non-cat whether, this would be truly episodic, nothing trend wise you\u2019ve seen in that?\nAlan Schnitzer: That's correct. Nothing trend wise and that, it's all volatility and non-cat weather.\nRandy Binner: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKai Pan: Good morning. First question is on the pricing, slight uptick in the second quarter. Could you give a little bit more granularity in term by lines or by count size, what do you see underlying sort of trends there in terms of both by - from supply and demand side. And what do you see could potentially be the upside pricing as well as downside to that pricing?\nBrian MacLean: Yeah, Kai, so this is Brian. I\u2019ll start, a couple of broad dynamics. Not surprisingly, Auto was the line where we're seeing the most positive pricing movement. Comp is, I think, the line with the most pressure, and that's, I think, really consistent with workers comp, if you see what\u2019s coming out of NCCI and other competitors, that's not surprising. From an account size perspective, larger accounts under more pressure, so we've talked a lot and others have talked about a large property business. We think that's somewhat consistent with the returns that have been in that business, but some pressures are there, I think, even larger casualty business is under a little more pressure than the middle and small type of business. I don\u2019t think from an industry perspective, there is anything appreciable, but that would be the broad strokes.\nKai Pan: Okay. Then a follow-up on the reserve side, looks like reserve continued to be strong. And I just want to focus on those three areas. One is that, workers comp released in 2015, is that sort of like - is that too early for a long-term on the business. And secondly, the $82 million environmental charges, looks like we are having those amounts for - at least for the last five to six years, just wondering any, like, why wouldn't you book, if you know the pattern is there, why wouldn't you book a big charge upfront. And then the third piece is a pretty strong, like a bond, especially continue to release that any underlying loss cost trend there will be appreciated. Thank you so much.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Kai. This is Jay Benet. Let\u2019s try to take them in order. So, as far as the workers comp, you're absolutely right, when you have a very long tail line of business, you look very, very carefully at things that happened in the short-term and don't necessarily react to them. In the case of workers\u2019 comp, what you're seeing here is favorable development in 2015 that related to a relatively short component of it relating to medical where medical bills come in quickly, they get resolved quickly, and the assumption that we had put in there for medical inflation was just too high. So while the line itself is a long tail line, there are components of it that are more short tail, and that's primarily why we reacted to there. As far as the environmental piece is concerned, I think, if you look at us, as well as the industry, you'll see a similar pattern, if you will, of people trying to, at various points in time, estimate what the ultimate is going to be for environmental losses, and recognizing that you're dealing with something that is a very difficult kind of reserve to truly evaluate. So, in doing so, you have to make various assumptions as to what the future is going to look like in terms of new claims, new policyholders, what the average frequency and severity might be associated with things that have been reported or not reported. And it's those assumptions that you're constantly updating as time goes on. So what we disclosed, I\u2019ll point you to the 10-Q, what we disclosed this year is actually very similar to what we've disclosed in prior periods and what you've seen other companies disclose that there really hasn't been a change in the environment per se, things have gotten a little better, but the rate of them getting better has just been less than - previously assumed or hoped for, and that's a chunk of the reserve addition. In addition to that, we\u2019re always subject to judicial rulings or other things to take place episodically in various jurisdictions. There was one that came out of the Northwest, increased modestly, some of our claim cost there that we also recognized. And then finally, on the Bond & Specialty, this was a quarter for a fairly large prior reserve development benefit. I wouldn't say there was anything unusual about it. This is, as you know, it's a high severity low frequency business. It's one where information emerges slowly. As it emerges, you're always evaluating whether or not it's blossomed to a level where you really feel action is appropriate. So, there are things that have been taking place whether it's in items related to the financial crisis or whatever that we\u2019ve been watching, but things got to a point this quarter where we recognized that it was appropriate to take some reserve action. It wasn't any one product line, it wasn't any one particular claim or things like that, it was pretty much spread across the whole Management Liability and Surety book of business.\nKai Pan: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMichael Nannizi: Thanks so much. Can you talk a little bit about, when we talked about non-cat weather in BI and Personal Auto.? Can you talk about non-cat weather in homeowners\u2019 book and how that has looked recently?\nBrian MacLean: Michael, this is Brian, again. In this quarter, similarly there was some, but not to the same degree. So just to quantify this, as I said about a point on the Auto side, it was probably about half-a-point on the Personal Property side of some impact there, so some, but not as dramatic of that, again, that specifically the PCS event.\nMichael Nannizi: Got it. I guess I am just curious because it looks like in the last few quarters, like especially in BI, we've talked about non-cat weather impacting the underlying and sort of a driver for the year-over-year comps being negative. And then in Auto, it looks like it was a factor this quarter as well, but when I look at my estimates and your results over the last several quarters, Homeowners has been consistently better. And I think better even relative to your outlook as you've disclosed in your Qs. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand how - why the impact is potentially disproportionate in these areas, because the nature of the risk is different or reinsurance or something else that's causing non-cat weather to be - it looks like a tailwind in one and potentially a headwind in the others.\nMichael Klein: Yeah, Michael, this is Michael Klein. I think what you're seeing is a combination of factors in the Home product and weather is one of them. In the case of this quarter, I think what you see is, to Brian\u2019s point on the net impact, it's a couple of moving parts underneath. You\u2019ve got the weather impact, but we also have sort of underlying experience on fire, non-weather water losses. That again, also fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. So when Brian talked about weather and other normal quarterly fluctuations, that's really what he\u2019s talking about and this quarter was an example of that where we had some other non-cat weather, again, non-weather water, fire experience that came in better than expected. And importantly, for the year-over-year comparison, this quarter, there actually was a significant individual risk fire loss in the second quarter of last year that helps the quarter-over-quarter comparison just to give you a little bit of color on that.\nMichael Nannizzi: Got it. That's very helpful, thanks. And then, maybe Brian, on BI, so it sounded like from Alan\u2019s comments that the lift in the expense ratio was commissioned related. I'm guessing that means that it should continue, because I'm also just sort of trying to square that, because at 33, no, it\u2019s not, okay.\nBrian MacLean: Yeah, the commission - last year in the second quarter, we had a takedown in our contingent commission accrual that reduced the number. So that created a year-over-year kind of difference.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. The delta is not really in the base commission, so delta is in these other things that caused quarter-to-quarter variances.\nBrian MacLean: Yeah.\nMichael Nannizzi: Got it. But I guess my other point is so the 33.3 expense ratio in this quarter, forget the comps, but just the app number this quarter, is that how we should be thinking about, because it sounds like there was some one-offs last year, but this quarter, is that how we should be thinking about the expense ratio from here?\nAlan Schnitzer: It's Alan, Michael. I guess I would say that we try not to forecast on these individual pieces, but what I\u2019d suggest is maybe you go back over the last - I don\u2019t know, somewhere between two and four quarters and average the number and maybe use that as sort of a proxy for a go-forward number, but there is always going to be some volatility quarter-to-quarter.\nMichael Nannizzi: Okay. Got it. Just because it does scream relatively high when I go back, so it sounds like maybe there is some volatility, I was just trying to understand what drove just some episode of higher expense ratio that should cause that to normalize as you\u2019re sort of suggesting, it should, but maybe I can follow up afterwards. Thanks.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thanks. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. My first question I guess is for Brian. I was just hoping for a little bit more color on what's been driving the solid new business growth in middle markets. I think you mentioned submissions are up, but I guess sort of like over the past couple of quarters that it has been pretty strong and just sort of what you're seeing on the new business front?\nBrian MacLean: I think it's a couple of factors. We believe, as I tried to say in my comments, driven by the factor, I think we're in a pretty strong position in the marketplace. We\u2019ve been executing in a very stable and effective way, I think for a long period of time. We've got some real competitive advantages. The overall market is pretty stable, but there has been some pretty well publicized dislocations, and at least a couple of very large carriers had been very open about taking profit, improvement actions, and so that's created some specific opportunities, but I think, we think more broadly, has also created a little bit of a mood in the marketplace of flight to quality. So like I said, we've seen our submission activity up a decent amount and we've also, consistent with that, been driving a message to our organization, not strategically to do anything different with returns, but to be more active, and to be out there quoting more. So, just to be blunt about it, we're pushing our place pretty hard right now to be real active in the marketplace and get out of the quotes and not compromise on returns, but try to meet the opportunity of the submission activity, and that's been paying off in specifically our core middle market, commercial accounts business and the construction areas.\nAlan Schnitzer: Ryan, I would add to that that part of our motivation behind pushing little bit more activities, just where returns are, product returns in the marketplace after five or so years of price increases, and so there is a lot out there that's potentially attractive to us, consistent. This is really important, consistent with our return objectives. So we're not making any compromises on that.\nRyan Tunis: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I guess my other question was just looking at the margin trajectory in Agency Auto and how to think about that on a go-forward basis. I guess, year-to-date, there have been a couple of things that have been - that seemed to have been weighing on the loss, actually on loss ratio some, is the new business drag, then there is the elevated non-cat weather, but something that we were a little bit - interesting was looking at the 10-Q, it looks like the language looking in to 2017 was that margins would remain kind of where they have been. And I'm just kind of curious, as you lap the elevated new business and you get rid of the lower non-cat weather, why would margins not be improving kind of as you look out into 2017?\nBrian MacLean: So I think, just a couple of quick comments and I will pass it to Michael. Certainly, we view that the non-cat weather as episodic, and so we think that should absolutely return to normal levels. On the new business dynamic, the good news is that we continue to write some significant levels of new business through that product. So we feel great that we are building real embedded value in that portfolio, but it is going to take longer. The stronger the production topline is, the longer it is going to take for that to really work through the loss ratio. The other point I'd make is, the Quantum 2.0 product also was designed to have a lower expense ratio and a little bit higher on loss side. So you have to look at the combined in total to get that product. So...\nMichael Klein: Brian, if I can just clarify something. One of the things we actually added to the Q this quarter was in the outlook section, we have previously spoken to underlying underwriting margins. So we thought it was important to add combined ratio, because people often use those terms interchangeably. And as you know, the combined ratio is a function of the premium volume, whereas, the margins are just dollars. And just to clarify what we're saying here in the Q is, for Auto, which I think is what we're talking about, the early part of '17, the company expects underlying underwriting margins, the dollars to be slightly higher because of what's taking place with writing higher volumes of business, that's profitable. But writing a higher percentage of new business relative to the base is also causing a slight uptick in the underlying combined ratio. So, you have this feature here where the dollars are going up, at the same time that the combined ratio is going up. So I just wanted to clarify that.\nRyan Tunis: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. I think I was a little bit confused by that. Thanks guys, appreciate it.\nAlan Schnitzer: Ryan, the other factor just to know it's not all this new business impact from what we are writing. As Michael explained a second ago, we haven't had this last quarter or so, this favorable non-weather loss activity. And as we also highlighted in 10-Q, we expect that to return to a more normal level. So that's also having on a go-forward basis, a slight adverse impact.\nMichael Klein: This is Michael Klein. We\u2019re looking at what is underneath just to reiterate, right, Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced at the same return level as the book of business has been priced to. So it really is the dynamic of preponderance of newer I think of it as younger business, right, the portfolio is getting younger because of the outsized growth that we've seen over the last couple of years. But the long-term return targets for the product will remain consistent with where they have been.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks, and good morning. Two quick questions, probably these are follow-ups. And I apologize if I'm still not clear. Just going back to the discussion on BI and what Randy was asking, if you ex out all the moving parts, and just focus on the underlying discussion on the negative loss cost trends versus on pricing, is it episodic as what you're seeing or is this - the usual sort of trend line, i.e., you've talked about this in the past that overtime this equation will get flipped, and now we're at the point where it has flipped. I'm just trying to understand that.\nAlan Schnitzer: It's not episodic. There is a trend there, but I think what we've told in the past is, there is some danger to looking at that very narrow definition of rate versus loss trend. And obviously, anybody could look at rate which is sort of around zero and loss trend, which is something north of zero on a written basis, and it has been moving in that direction for some number of quarters, so as anybody as we would've expected, as that earns in over time, there will be some negative pressure on margin. But what we've said in the past is you've got to look at that in the context of all the other moving pieces that impact underlying underwriting margin, things like we have a tax impact year-over-year this quarter, there is expenses, there is base years, there is mix, all those other things go into that number, and what we've shown you this quarter is all that comes out to about a wash. And I guess, I'd also point you to the outlook where we give you a sense of over the next four quarters or so that we would expect underlying underwriting margins obviously subject to the volatility of weather and whatnot to continue to be broadly consistent.\nBrian MacLean: The other thing I\u2019d emphasize, this is Brian, is that there's a lot of things in there that we have to react to, and there are other things in there that we are actively managing. And so, you shouldn't have the impression that we are just sitting by, and as Alan just said, pricing is at roughly zero this quarter, rate and loss trend is something north of that that we're just conceding that margins will recede. We are managing our mix, we're taking actions in underwriting selection, we're taking actions in claim execution, which are all impacting our loss trend. And then, we are reacting to weather volatility, et cetera, that might be moving through the business. So there is no denying that the sheer arithmetic of that narrow piece, the loss trend in the rate right now is a negative. We've said in the past that it's relatively modest, and it continues to be relatively modest, and then there are all the other impacts that are going through.\nAmit Kumar: Got it. That's a fair comment. The second question I had was just going back to the discussion on Quantum 2.0. In the past, when we\u2019ve talked about loss cost trends, frequency was pecked at 0.5, severity was at 2.5. Has there been any evolution in that number or is it still the same?\nBrian MacLean: No. We didn't see anything different in the core underlying trends of what was going on in the Auto book. So we would be at exactly those numbers you just said, about 0.5 frequency, 2.5 severity. And as we\u2019ve said in the Quantum Auto 2.0 specifically, still running consistent with our loss expectations.\nAmit Kumar: Yeah, got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nCharles Sebaski: Thanks for getting me in. I guess I'd like to follow-up again on, following [indiscernible] Quantum 2.0, and the Agency Auto book, and the clarity. I realized there is an additional disclosure in the Q, but how you guys expect the Auto book to evolve out. I guess, the commentary of early '17 being plus or minus 16, which is plus or minus 15, and you say that you\u2019re underwriting to a same return dynamic. But I guess, this has been a book influx that coming out of 2011 and '12 where it\u2019s been underperforming and the introduction of Quantum 2.0, just where is the run rate on what you should - what we should expect that - there is so many moving parts, but it seemed like there should be a story that was improving, and I guess, the commentary seems to be that it's maybe gotten as good as it's going to get. Is that right?\nBrian MacLean: So the message absolutely is not, this is as good as it's going to get. The core from a profitability perspective, let me start with the top line perspective, because what\u2019s the story on Quantum 2.0. We have been pleasantly surprised with the traction the product has gotten in the business in the marketplace. We clearly went in with an expectation that this would enhance growth and we've done better than our original expectations there and you can see the numbers. So we feel good about that. And we are not sure where that's going to go exactly in the future, but we think that we're going to be able to sustain some pretty decent amount of growth going forward. From the profitability perspective, just as it is true of all business that we've ever written in this product, it matures over the years, and so there's a tenure impact. And as Michael just said, the younger tenured business is typically not as profitable as we write the business where we\u2019re targeting a tenured, longer-term return and we're on track to do that. So as this portfolio matures, and as Quantum 2.0, as we get more and more of the aging of the book, we believe the trend should absolutely be improving profitability on this business.\nCharles Sebaski: Okay. I guess, on that, could you give us some additional insight on the tenure, the curing of the Auto book on what is the average policy life for you guys on this? I guess, when I think of some commercial accounts that might be longer, it seems that Auto still is a quick-return product. So this introduction of new growth, which has really been strong, what's the timeline for curing on an Auto book and how long do you average keep Auto policies?\nMichael Klein: So, Charles, I don't know that I\u2019ll get into the specifics of the policy life expectancy, et cetera, but to give you a little bit more color, this is Michael, on aging of the Auto book, you have to really think about both components of what's going on here, right. So first, you need to think about a vintage and think about a book of business we're writing to given policy year, and that new business that we write in that term that comes on at a higher loss ratio early, and then as we renew, it improves. If you look at the production statistics that we've been disclosing and the high levels of new business, what's happening inside the portfolio then, which is the second piece, is on average the portfolio is getting younger, right. And if younger business carries a higher loss ratio, that's what we described as the increase in the combined. So when you look at the outlook for the first half of - or I'm sorry, the second of '16, we see the combined ratio will be higher due to the impact of the higher new business levels we\u2019ve been writing, that is the underlying dynamic that's flowing through the book, that does continue into the first half of '17, it just gets offset by an expectation of return to normalized non-cat weather levels. And so the underlying dynamic of the book getting younger meaning, less tenured, right, we\u2019ve had the accounts not as long, continues into \u201817, recognize also though that as we write more Quantum Auto 2.0 business, there is a benefit to the combined ratio from an offsetting improvement in the expense ratio, because it carries commissions. So that underlying ageing of the book or reducing average tenure of the book does continue into \u201817, it just gets offset by again an expectation of a return to more normalized weather. That\u2019s why the outlook reads the way it does.\nBrian MacLean: It's an assumption, not an expectation.\nMichael Klein: I'm sorry, it's an assumption.\nAlan Schnitzer: So one of the point on that, so again, as Michael said, we\u2019re not going to give you explicitly the target we have for life expectancy on policies. We think that's part of our competitive kind of conversation. We clearly accept that hitting the expectations of retaining the business is important, which is why in my comments, I emphasized that as we are going into year two and in some cases year three for the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, we feel really good that we are hitting the retention rates we expected. So whatever our expectation was for life expectancy, along with our statement about losses are progressing, so is the retention of the business and you can look at our long-term retention and begin to deduce some kind of policy life expectancy by just doing the arithmetic.\nCharles Sebaski: Thank you very much for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJay Gelb: Thank you. I was hoping to get a bit more insight on the pace of share buybacks. It's slowed over the past few quarters on a linked-quarter basis. And the slowdown in share buybacks was actually a little greater than the reduction in earnings for the first half of 2015 to the first half of 2016. Can you give us a bit more insight on that?\nJay Benet: Yes. Jay, this is Jay. I think you\u2019re looking back at a period of time where, as we\u2019ve said in the past, over time, share buybacks are going to be enabled by earnings and all these pension contributions and whatever, it's the earnings of the place over time that will drive what the total share buybacks and dividends are and what you saw and I think you even ask the question in the past can we continue to buyback at levels that are higher than our earnings, well, this is the flipside of it. This is just an indication of the timing element of when we look and see what the future quarter projections are. They obviously come out to be whatever they will be and we\u2019re just taking the numbers in the particular quarter that we\u2019re doing the share buybacks over a longer term view to say in this particular quarter, 550 sounds like the right number. So I wouldn't read anything into it in terms of a change in philosophy or a change in execution, it's just going to be the, what we\u2019d refer to as the normal quarterly variation and the policy and a discipline that's been set for a long period of time.\nJay Gelb: I see. Okay. Thank you for that. Second one, what was the overall impact in the combined ratio in 2Q from non-cat weather? On a combined ratio basis?\nAlan Schnitzer: We are looking.\nJay Gelb: Okay. While you're - if you have that number. I also wanted to ask about - I know the UK leave vote is not significant relative to Travelers in its overall business, but if you have any thoughts on that, I think that would be real helpful for us.\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure. In terms of BREXIT, the most significant impact to us would be whatever it means for the overall economic activity, the amount of premium that we write out of the UK that relies on passporting is very, very small, it\u2019s something like 5% of our overall international premium and about half of that is to Lloyd\u2019s and we assume that one way or another, Lloyd\u2019s will address the passporting issue as will we by the way. A long way to go to see how that's going to work out and what the ultimate arrangements are going to be, but other than the overall macro impact, we don't expect any significant impact to us.\nJay Gelb: Appreciate that, Alan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. And congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape in the personal lines business. We've had a few management changes of recent note, like places at Progressive and State Farm. I'm wondering if the components of who is being competitive out there have changed in the last year.\nMichael Klein: Yes, Paul. This is Michael Klein. I would say broadly speaking, the answer to that question is no, I mean, competitive dynamics are very local in the business as well. And so while there have been changes in management at some national competitors and frankly, some local regionals as well, the broad competitive dynamics in the business remain consistent, when we look at the rate filing monitoring that we do in the business to assess the rates that carry and take in particular states in auto or home. We don't see a lot of shift in behavior there. So I would say the competitive dynamics are broadly consistent.\nPaul Newsome: So, the general idea that the agency folks keep losing share and the regionals and the direct people are the most competitive? Is that still kind of really the case?\nMichael Klein: I think if you look at the latest A.M. Best data, you continue to see some incremental shift in share by channel. Interestingly, I think consistent with the last couple of years, the majority of the games you are seeing in the sort of online direct channel are actually coming from captive and less and less from independent agency, but broadly I think those trends continue.\nPaul Newsome: Great, thanks. Appreciated.\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. Somebody asked the question about what was the impact on the combined ratio of non-cat weather. And one thing, I will give you the number but I also have to give a little bit of a preface to it. Now, we are parsing things very thin here and talking strictly about that. So if you have the question what's the impact of non-cat weather on a combined ratio on a consolidated basis, we would say 150 basis points. But I\u2019d also point out that if you ask the question about well what about other losses that goes in a different direction and what about mix and that goes in a different direction. So we will answer your question but there is lots and lots of things that are taking place here that makes the one number not necessarily indicative of the trends or of what's going to or what the expectation is. So I would just urge you to go back to the Q and the outlook to see what all of this to us actually translates into.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJay Cohen: Just to follow up, the language in the Q on the commercial - on the business insurance segment, you extended the commentary on the margin into 2017. Again, the broadly consistent language, I assume that\u2019s largely because of the first half of \u201816 at a high level of loss activity non-cat weather, is that fair?\nAlan Schnitzer: That\u2019s right there are some large losses in non-cat weather that in the outlook we would expect to return to normal levels, we would assume.\nJay Cohen: Got it. Thanks and then the second question may be for Bill Heyman because he hasn\u2019t had a chance to speak yet. Obviously, as we would expect the non-fixed income returns are always going to be variable. Can you give us a sense given how the portfolio is constructed today, what is an expected return for that portfolio at this point?\nBill Heyman: Thanks Jay, I think an expected return for non-fixed income ought to be in the high single digits pre-tax. If you look at this quarter, we made a bit more real estate then we figured, real estate has two components rentals from properties we own, and NII from real estate funds. Hedge funds were below what we expected but positive and the big variable was private equity where the portfolio was almost flat maybe few million dollars and we would have expected about $50 million pre-tax. Now what\u2019s interesting is the cash flow from that portfolio has remained at historical levels. And it typically hasn\u2019t contained as much NII in the past. So, we still we would aim for a double-digit pre-tax return on these assets and if we didn't feel we can do that we probably would reduce our allocation. But I think a fair expectation is high-single digits pre-tax.\nGabriella Nawi: And the next question will be our last question. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney. Please go ahead.\nLarry Greenberg: And I apologize for going back to this but I mean just listening to some of the chatter that\u2019s out there this morning, there is something of a view that you guys elaborating on the pricing lost trend relationship in business insurance suggests that you\u2019re seeing or thinking something new. And if I hear what you're saying it really doesn't appear to be the case and I just want to be sure that I\u2019ve got that right.\nAlan Schnitzer: Larry, it's Alan. Let me be very clear about this there is nothing that\u2019s changed there is nothing that\u2019s surprising us and everything is consistent with what we\u2019ve reported to you on a written basis over the last four quarters. The real reason we put it in there is we wanted to be completely transparent, it\u2019s a very small piece but we thought gee, if we didn't put it in there, you or somebody would have said to us, gee, how can this not be happening because we are looking at your written numbers over the last three or four quarters. So I\u2019ll just reiterate it\u2019s small, it's within our expectations, it wraps up with all the other things that are typically moving around in a quarter, it\u2019s about a wash in terms of the year-over-year impact and nothing - no message intended in terms of anything out of the ordinary, completely expected, completely consistent with what we've seen on a written basis and we continue to be very pleased with the model of returns on the business that we're writing.\nLarry Greenberg: And then just my follow up, Jay in your discussion on non-renewing that cat on, I think you said that the reason was due to your current risk profile and I'm just curious about that comment and if you could elaborate a little bit on that?\nJay Benet: Primarily our cat program is one that products capital not one that really deals with income protection, if you look at where limits are and things of that sort and where the attachment points are, it's pretty high up there. So in any given period, we\u2019re looking at the entirety of it, where our property exposures are and just given the way the book has evolved over the last few years, we just felt that this wasn't really adding much on a risk versus cost basis so we decided not to renew it.\nGabriella Nawi: Great, that's it. It concludes our call for today, as always we at investor relations are available for follow-up questions. Have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect all lines.

Also, in our remarks and responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website. And now, Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter operating income of $698 million, or $2.33 per share, and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Especially in light of a relatively high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, our underwriting results across the board remain strong, as reflected in our combined ratio of 92.3%. To put the weather in some context, our catastrophe losses were about $100 million, after tax, higher in the quarter than they were last year, and these are the highest first quarter cat losses we've had since 2010. The timing of catastrophes is, of course, unpredictable, but this level of weather volatility is certainly within our playbook. We're confident in our ability to model and manage our exposures and that we're pricing appropriately for the risk. In this case, it just so happens that, by design, we have a healthy market share in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, where severe hailstorms were concentrated. Doreen will have more to say about the severity and about our claim analytics. The real story this quarter is about our execution in the marketplace. And across all our businesses, we couldn't be more pleased. In our commercial businesses, we continued to be successful in our efforts to maximize retentions on our best-performing accounts and improved profitability on poor-performing business. Retentions in the quarter were again at very high levels by historical standards and renewal premium change was positive. We believe these production results were right on target, given our view of product returns, but as we've explained before, we don't manage the business on an aggregate basis. We execute deliberately, account-by-account or class-by-class. And you can see this on Slide 13 of the webcast, which displays the distribution of rate changes for our Middle Market accounts in the first quarter. As you can see from the slide, most accounts received a single-digit rate increase and there were a number of accounts that had a rate increase of greater than 5% or even 10%. So even now with the headline pure rate change just slightly negative, we continue to achieve rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorer-performing business. The real takeaway from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions, and that success in this business is not about the aggregate rate number. It's about taking the right action on each account and generating an appropriate return over time. Our execution in the quarter also benefited from a commercial lines pricing environment that, from our vantage point, continues to be remarkably stable. The outlook that we provided this morning in our 10-Q for our BII and BSI segments suggest more of the same: continued high levels of retention and broadly consistent underlying underwriting margins. In terms of execution, we were just as successful in our Personal Insurance business, with strong retentions and higher PIF counts in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. Importantly, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations on all fronts. The successful execution across all our businesses resulted in consolidated net written premiums that were about 5% higher in the quarter than they were in the prior year. Both new business levels and historically high levels of retention, particularly in our Middle Market business, contributed significantly to the top-line growth. The quality and breadth of our products and services, our extraordinary talent in the field and the strength of the relationships that we have with our agent and broker partners put us in a great position to win. In addition to that, we believe that we benefited in the quarter, both in terms of new and renewal business, from the stability and consistency we provide in the marketplace compared to some of our competitors, who are experiencing varying degrees of disruption. Turning to capital management, as a reflection of the confidence that we have in our business, today, our Board of Directors declared an approximately 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.67 per share, the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases, and bringing the compound annual growth rate of the dividend to almost 10% over that time. All-in-all, despite an active quarter from a catastrophe perspective, a great start to the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.\nJay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we were pleased with our first quarter results, operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite their being lower than the prior year quarter. As page 4 of the webcast indicates, the $129 million decrease in operating income from last year's first quarter did not come about due to lower underlying underwriting results. Our consolidated underlying combined ratio is 90% this quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Rather, the decrease in operating income, along with the decrease in operating ROE, resulted from two items: cat losses that were $101 million higher on an after-tax basis than those in the first quarter of 2015; and, as we anticipated in the Outlook section of our 2015 10-K, a $24 million after-tax reduction in fixed income net investment income that was driven by the continuing low interest rate environment. Page 4 also provides an analysis as to how our reported results compared to analyst estimates. As best we can tell, analyst estimates for cat losses were significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Our net investment income was $439 million, after tax, this quarter, which was $39 million lower than the prior year quarter. In addition to the lower fixed income returns, non-fixed income NII was down $15 million after-tax, due to lower hedge fund returns that resulted from the more challenging capital market conditions in recent months. Each of our business segments once again contributed to net favorable prior year reserve development which totaled $180 million on a pre-tax basis. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $93 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in Workers' Comp excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior; and General Liability, primarily for excess coverages for accident years 2011 and 2013; in Commercial Auto for accident years 2010 and prior; and in our European and Canadian operations. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $60 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in Surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $27 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in Homeowners and Other for liability coverages for accident year 2014, and in Auto for accident year 2014. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years developed favorably, other than the 2015 accident year, which is currently showing $65 million of unfavorable development, due to a few large property losses that occurred late in 2015 and a decision we made to rebalance personal insurance reserves among various accident years. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines either developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter. While CMP developed unfavorably by $35 million, there was offsetting favorable development in the Property product line, as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the Property line at year-end 2015 was subsequently determined to be CMP-related. Operating cash flows of $850 million remain very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of over $1.7 billion. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.7 billion pre-tax, or $1.8 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $82.65 and adjusted book value per share of $76.63 increased 4% and 2%, respectively, from the beginning of the year. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $790 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $181 million and repurchased $609 million of our common shares this quarter, including $550 million under our publicly-announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $59 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.61 to $0.67 per share. So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian.\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thanks, Jay. In Business and International Insurance, operating income was $476 million, with a combined ratio of 94.8%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 93.3%, up about 0.5 point compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a typical level of quarterly fluctuations within both the loss and expense ratios. This result is in line with our expectations, and we continue to feel very good about our underlying results. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year, with Domestic Business Insurance premiums up about 5%, driven by the strong production results across all our businesses. In Domestic Business Insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. Given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention and, accordingly, we're very pleased that retention is at a historical high of 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change came in at 2.2 points, while renewal rate change was down slightly in the quarter and about flat overall. New business increased to $575 million, reflecting strong results across all our businesses. Turning to the individual businesses, beginning with Select, we achieved strong retention of 81%, and renewal premium change of nearly 7%. Rate change was down about a point versus the fourth quarter of 2015, driven in large part by recently filed rate changes in Workers' Compensation. We generated new business of $103 million, up slightly year-over-year. In Middle Market, retention reached a historic high of 88%, with renewal premium change of a point, in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Importantly, retention of our best-performing business was approximately 90%, while for our poorer-performing accounts, we achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend. New business of $321 million was up 8% year-over-year, due in large part to strong results in our Construction business. In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Renewal premium change of about a point was in line with recent quarters, while new business of $151 million was up 24% versus the prior year, driven by Inland Marine, Boiler and Transportation lines of business. So across Domestic Business Insurance, we achieved strong retention and saw an increased level of new business opportunities in the marketplace. As Alan mentioned, our agents and brokers view us as a stable market with industry-leading products and services, which we believe had a favorable impact on both retention and new business, particularly in this environment, where several significant competitors are experiencing some degree of disruption. Turning to International, net written premiums for the first quarter were down about 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 4%, driven by disciplined underwriting in the face of highly competitive market conditions in the property lines at Lloyds. Retention for the quarter was strong at 82%. Renewal premium change was slightly negative, but above recent quarters, and new business of $76 million was up more than 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic personal lines auto product in Canada. This product was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. And while we're still in the early days of the rollout, we're encouraged by the response, as we continue to see a significant increase in new business volume. In summary, in the segment, we achieved strong underlying underwriting and production results, a great start to 2016. And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter. And we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from the first quarter of 2015, due primarily to a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. We've also improved underlying underwriting results. The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was almost two points better than the prior year, driven by two items: one, the favorable expense impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during second quarter of 2015; and second, lower loss levels in certain management liability businesses. Underlying returns in this segment were once again very strong and remain well within our target level. Results like this do not happen by accident. Insights provided by our deep industry expertise and analytics, along with disciplined execution of long-term strategies, has positioned us to successfully navigate arising economic challenges, the most recent being the disruption in the coal and broader energy sectors. As for top line, we generated higher net written premiums for the quarter as compared to 2015 in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. The increased Surety production reflected higher contract bond activity from mid-sized construction accounts. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remains strong at 87%. New business premium was up more than 20% from the first quarter of 2015, and renewal premium change was up from recent quarters, driven by the non-rate components of RPC, including slight increases in average policy duration and insured exposures. These results reflect the execution of our strategy to retain our best accounts and write more business in our return adequate product segments. In sum, strong top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty and we continue to feel great about this segment's performance. I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $139 million, down $113 million from the prior year quarter due to $69 million in higher tax and $68 million in lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The segment's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, 1.4 points better than the 2015 quarter. This improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio, which was due, in large part, to higher premium volume. We continue to be pleased with production results and underlying financial returns in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other. Looking at Agency Auto, we once again generated strong top line results and the loss experience of Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to perform in line with expectations. The combined ratio of 95.2% for the quarter was five points higher than the prior year quarter, due primarily to higher tax and a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 94% was up 1 point from last year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. As we've discussed before, the significant levels of new business we've added in the last couple of years will result in a higher calendar year loss ratio in the early years, and improve over time. Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target return and is maturing in line with our expectation. As for our overall view of loss trend, blended frequency of severity remains unchanged at around 3%. Production results continue to be exceptional at Agency Auto, with net written premiums up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher new business premiums and strong retention. We continue to grow policies in force, which increased 55,000 during the quarter. Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, we generated a combined ratio of 90.4%, even including catastrophes of 16 points. While cats were higher this quarter, the underlying combined ratio of 76.2% improved more than three points from the prior year quarter, driven by favorable non-cat weather. As you all know, weather will be volatile from period-to-period. As Alan mentioned, this quarter was particularly impacted by severe hailstorms in the Greater Dallas/Fort Worth area. Slide 21 of the webcast is an extract from our Hail Dashboard, which many of you will recognize from our Investor Day. This view is CAT 21, the most substantial event in the quarter, and shows you how much of the area was impacted by two and even three-inch hail. This demonstrates our proprietary capability to get near real-time data about hail size and duration, as well as potentially impacted policies. Using this information facilitates a more effective claim response and assists us in estimating losses. Using these tools, as well as our on-site work in the area, we identified this as a significant event early on and were somewhat surprised at how low the industry estimates were. As more information has become public, it would appear that industry estimates for this event will rise. Notwithstanding the weather volatility, we remain very pleased with the underlying financial returns we're generating in this business, as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. As for production in Agency Homeowners & Other, we continue to make good progress, in line with our expectations. New business premium was up more than 30% from the prior year quarter. Retention remains strong at 85%. And we added 26,000 policies during the quarter, so even with the significant cats during the quarter, a great start to the year for Personal Insurance. With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Thank you. We're now ready to take Q&A, if I could ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, go ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning. My first question on catastrophe in the quarter, the $380 million, almost a third of your sort of normalized annual budget of $1 billion, so does this surprise you? And there were talk about heightened activity in hailstorms. Does it have implication for your pricing as well as your market exposure?\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kai, good morning. It's Alan. Let me start and I'll see if others want to fill in. As I said in my opening remarks, the timing of catastrophes are always surprising to us, but there's nothing about the level of losses in that storm that are particularly surprising. It's in our playbook and we do feel like our risk selection and pricing is spot on, so nothing about this event that causes us to rethink anything. And if it had been a couple of weeks later in the second quarter, where we typically expect more frequency of severe storms, we wouldn't really have thought anything about it, so timing off by maybe a couple of weeks but nothing about it that we find surprising.\nKai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. My follow-up question is on the BI pricing, looks like continue the downward trends. I just wonder what give you confidence to maintain the good level of core margin or underlying margin, given the downward pricing trend, as well as now you have a higher level of new business. How do you make sure the underwriting of this or will that increase your initial accident year loss pick?\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Kai, if you look at the gradual slope of that pricing trend, yes, pricing is going down, but it's very, very gradual and it's consistent with our product returns. And this is why we wanted to put in Slide 13 that really shows you the redistribution. We continue to look at the execution on a granular basis, and we're very comfortable with the way that we're pricing relative to the returns that we expect, that we're getting on these products.\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah and, Kai, this is Brian MacLean. I'd just chime in on the new business front. First of all, I'd emphasize that we haven't changed any of our return thresholds or our target pricing. And if we're obsessing about one thing in the business today, it's the quality of the new business that we're taking in, and we remain very comfortable that it's in customer segments, products and industries that we really think we understand. So we feel very good about it.\nKai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Well, thank you so much.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nRyan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, great. Thanks. My first question, I think, is for Doreen. Just looking at margins, I guess, in Agency Auto, looked like the accident year loss ratio deteriorated by a little more than 1.5 points. And it sounded like you're still attributing that mostly to just the impact of new business. I'm just wondering if that's the type of margin drag we should expect for the remainder of the year from the pressure from new business, or if there's anything else, at least in the short-term, that maybe drove up that accident year loss ratio?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Let me talk about that for a minute. It is really attributable, and I would say solely; obviously, there's always a few things bouncing around, but driven by the volume of new business. What we build in to our modeling curves is the maturity of the book of business. And so what you'll see over time is, each cohort will begin to produce what our long-term returns are. So it is due to the level of new business.\nRyan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, understood. And then, I guess my follow-up then would just be for Jay Benet, on the investment income side. And it seems like a lot of the discussion's around lower investment yields, but something that stood out to us a little bit is that it looks like the average invested assets were down about a little more than 1% on the quarter. And it also looked like there was, in the 10-Q, an allusion to a $0.5 billion payment on the asbestos side that's coming in the second quarter. So just trying to understand, when you think about that $25 million to $30 million quarterly drag, is that contemplating sort of a lower level of invested assets, or should we think about that as all just being driven by your view of lower reinvestment rates? Thanks.\nJay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, hi. This is Jay Benet. It is a combination of our view as to what the rate environment looks like, as well as what the average invested assets are and will be. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of last year, we had a large payment to finalize the direct actions settlement for asbestos. That brought the average down a little bit. And, as you rightly point out, we're expecting to make a final payment on the PPG settlement when other parties finalize some of the remaining issues, which we don't view as significant issues, in the second quarter. We expect to make that payment in the second quarter, so that will have an impact as well. Something else that affects the average invested assets, some of our assets are denominated in foreign currency. So you do have some currency exchange taking place where, in effect, the assets are still the same, just the currency-adjusted value is a little lower. But those are the two primary things, the two asbestos payments, that bring it down.\nRyan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, thanks so much.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nCharles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thank you. First question is on that new business growth in Business Insurance, hoping to just get a little bit more color on, if that's coming from sort of disruption? It seems like the growth relative to the pricing trend, or what is talked about in the industry, is a little bit upside down. I mean, it's a little surprising, the size of it, so I would appreciate any help you could give on what's, you think, is really causing that expansion.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. It's Alan and, again, I'll start. We don't think there's anything different in the pricing, and there's certainly nothing different in the return thresholds that we're seeking that's driving that. At \u2013 both increased levels of retention and new business are contributing to it. I think that's an important point. And we really start with what I said in my opening remarks. We think it's the quality and breadth of our products and services, the talent we have in the field, the relationships we have with our producers. All of that always puts us in a great position to win. And on top of that this quarter, as both Brian and I noted, there was some disruption in the marketplace. And given our stability out there, we do think we benefit from that. It's hard, probably impossible, for any of us to try to put a finer point on the allocation of dollars to one cause or another, but we do think all of those things coming together resulted in the higher new business levels.\nCharles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. And then, I guess for Doreen, I saw earlier in the quarter, you guys had a press release out that you're offering a discount for connected homeowners policies. I'm just curious. Any update on kind of that, or any of the other initiatives using technology into personal lines, be it pricing, be it UBI, et cetera?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Yeah, we're still a little new in the space. I'll tell you a couple of things that we have. You know we have IntelliDrive, where we do offer a discount. It's mileage based. We're actually looking further into that, based on the apps (31:19) that are available and perhaps moving beyond mileage. So that's obviously on the list. Second, we did roll out, in a couple of pilot states, for use for individuals when they're using their car for Uber. And what it really does is, it covers what's called the trolling period. Until there's a match, then the coverage is clear that there isn't any personal insurance coverage. And then, this discount for connected homes and if you think about it, similar to what we would do for someone who has an alarm or something of that sort, but we do have both of our homes up at Claim U are connected homes. So we can study how the data comes in. We can study what that changes about the underwriting process and the claim process. And we're also a member of CNET, which has a very sophisticated connected home in Kentucky. And we're the only insurer on that CNET home board looking for all the applications in the connected space, so that's just a little of what we've got going on.\nCharles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Appreciate all the answers. Thanks a lot, guys.\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Vinay Misquith from Sterne Agee. Please proceed.\nVinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Hi. Good morning. So the first question for Doreen, just wanted to follow up on the personal auto side. I believe you said frequency was up 3% this quarter for personal auto. Curious as to what it was last year, and have you seen any negative impact from the warmer weather so far in the northeast in the first quarter on your frequency?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: I'm going to give you really detailed answer, but the first thing I want do is correct that we've seen frequency of 3%. We've seen a normalized trend of 3%, which includes 0.5 point for frequency and 2.5 for severity. And that's been something that we've basically had baked into our results for two to three years at this point. So let me just go back a little bit on frequency, because I know we've talked a lot about it. We talked a lot about it at AFA, (34:03) too. We know that others have commented on frequency in the industry. Some have commented that they're seeing higher frequency. Some have not commented at all. So we don't feel like it's the thing that's just ripping through the industry. It's affecting very specific companies. And the most important thing for us is where you're starting from. What assumptions have you made? So we have not assumed flat frequency for a number of years. It's been a 0.5 point. And we may have talked about this last quarter, so I apologize if it's repetitive, but in 2014, there were some observations that frequency was dropping. We analyzed that very, very carefully and really didn't think it was systemic or sustainable. And so at that point, while we recognized the financial impact of that lower frequency for 2014, we went into 2015 assuming that trend was going to go back to where it was, and it did. And so the 0.5 point remains unchanged. The trend remains unchanged, and it really goes back to where you start from.\nVinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. That's helpful. The second question is just a follow-up on the new business growth on the Business Insurance. And it seems that the growth was faster in Middle Market and Other Business Insurance, where pricing is maybe slightly weaker than the Select accounts. So was that just a coincidence or just curious as to what's happening between those segments. Thank you.\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, so this is Brian. I think in Middle Market, in particular, we've been doing a lot of things with our process and our people to be really active in the marketplace. Our flow in new business opportunities there are up a bit. And so I think part of it is the activity we've had. I think it's also linked to, and, again, as Alan said, you can't draw perfect connections here, but there is disruption in the marketplace amongst some significant competitors. And I think our strong position with agents and brokers and the breadth of product that we have in capabilities have really helped us there. So I think we're very comfortable. As I also said, we're obsessing over the quality, so we're looking at all of those deals. In the Other Business Insurance world, there is some specific opportunities. We've got a transportation company, Northland Insurance, that does the smaller end of the trucking business, so not the large fleets primarily. They've had some neat opportunities. There's been some opportunity in the Inland Marine and Boiler business, again, somewhat a result of some actions that other carriers have taken. So I think all of those things have added up to it. And I think, I guess the main point, it's not tied directly to pricing and price change opportunity.\nVinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. On the Business Insurance rate increase now turning negative, in the 10-Q, I saw in your outlook that for Business Insurance, the expectation is still a stable underlying combined ratio. Can you help me square those two factors?\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Jay. It's Alan. When we talk about underlying underwriting margin in the outlook, what we're really talking about are dollars, not the combined ratio. And you could look at that as opposite sides of a coin, but we, for instance, would consider volume in there as well. But we've got the outlook being broadly consistent, and obviously we think about that as a margin of something around the prior year period. But in that outlook, earned margin is a little bit negative, and we've got an expectation for large losses improving and volume also improving, and those two things adding give us an outlook of broadly consistent.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I see. All right. And then my follow-up question is clearly you had elevated first quarter catastrophe losses; given all the destruction in Houston from the floods, if you can give us your perspective on that. Now, I know flooding isn't typically covered for things like homeowners, but it would impact comprehensive auto or maybe some commercial property insurance, if you could help us out there.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Jay, we're not going to pre-announce second quarter results. I would say we're early in the quarter and we typically expect the typical spring storms in the second quarter. So again, from a human perspective, human side of the news is terrible, but there's nothing about this that strikes us as particularly unusual. There are bad second quarter storms.\nJay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Understood. Thanks.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Doreen, just to follow-up then on Ryan's question on personal auto, so is it then fair then if it's a function of sort of new business versus the older book that's impacting the loss ratio, so is it fair to assume that as long as the Quantum book continues to grow that that drags sort of continue to run through calendar year results?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Michael, I'm not sure I heard the question, but was it that as long as we're writing Quantum Auto 2.0, we see a drag?\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, I think the answer to Ryan's question was something like it's not the new business discount so much a part of it, but it's also because the Quantum book is growing faster than the older book, so there's some mix as well. And so I'm just trying to understand like we had about 180 basis points of drag in the first quarter. Is it fair to assume that as long as Quantum continues to outpace your legacy book in growth, that that drag will continue to roll forward?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Well, Michael, in the outlook, what we said is that our combined ratio would slightly deteriorate. And so I think that's fair for 2016. So we did expect that that pressure would come, and a lot of it has to do with the volume of the business.\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yes. This is Brian. And I'm trying to get at what I think you're getting at. I'd make the point, the Quantum 2.0 profitability targets and margins are not different from our core book of business.\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Right.\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: It's the normal vintaging and aging of business. So if we continue to write significant levels of new business, that will have a comparable impact.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: And...\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Sorry, Mike, just to draw your attention it to; this is Gabby. Again, in the outlook, we do say the underlying underwriting margin and just to make fulsome, you've asked about the loss ratio, but, in fact, as we had talked about the Quantum product, it's the loss ratio and the expense ratio, given everything we had taken out. So if you look at the success of the product and what we're thinking about in terms of profitability, it all hangs together.\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Yeah. And look at the...\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: And to your point, the combined.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Great. And then just on the homeowners' side, just quickly, I saw the expense ratio tick down. It looks like that's sort of seasonally first quarter. But on the loss ratio side, is there anything that we should be thinking about in the underlying there or it looks like obviously you had cat activity, but was the non-cat weather element just lower in the quarter?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Yeah. For the first quarter, it was favorable non-cat weather.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Got it. And then last quickly, the tax...\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: That made it favorable.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: The tax rate in the quarter, maybe this is for Jay.\nJay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Yeah, I think you're asking the question why is the effective tax rate lower this quarter than it had been in prior year quarter. And the effective tax rate is always going to be driven by the mix of tax exempt income and fully taxable income. So what you're seeing here is the taxable income, fully taxable income, as a proportion of the total getting a little less because of the cat activity primarily. The change in the non-fully taxable income, the tax exempt income, was pretty de minimis. So if you do the math on that, you'll see that's the effect on the effective tax rate.\nMichael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good morning. Thanks for the call. Congratulations on the quarter. Is there a similar new business effect on the commercial lines side where the seasoning causes an increase in the accident year? And if we see a continued acceleration of new business in the commercial lines side, would we see a similar pattern that we're seeing on the personal lines side?\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. In short, yes. There's a new business vintaging kind of concept, where if you've got disproportionately more new business, that would affect your performance on the current year stuff.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And, Paul, it's Alan. That's one of the reasons we point out that when we look at the higher levels of premium, it's pretty much evenly distributed between retention and new business. So it's not all coming from...\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: New business at higher loss ratios.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Understood. Is it more or less pronounced, in your opinion, than we see in the personal lines business?\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're looking at each other. It's hard to say. It's probably similar, maybe a little less.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Okay. And then separately, I'd love to know a little bit more, from a product perspective, where we're seeing the disruptions from the competitive perspective?\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: I mentioned some of them. In the construction space, there has been action by other underwriters in the larger account size on the casualty side. There's been some action in the loss responsive businesses. But I think it's also broadly across middle market, and this is where, as Alan said, you can't triangulate to precisely what the numbers are. I think that we have a very strong position with distribution. We've got quality products, and we're viewed as a very stable market. So I think the broad market conditions, even beyond specific products, have been helpful, maybe uniquely to us there. (46:15)\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Paul, we definitely saw it in those lines of business where we know some of our competitors were taking some actions, but we also saw retention just up generally across middle market. And so, when we look at the flow we're seeing and the businesses that we're seeing it in, it's pretty broadly based.\nPaul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP: Good sign. Thank you very much.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nSarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Hi. Good morning. Following up on the Business Insurance underlying margin, is it fair to say that it's stable this year mostly because there was higher non-cat weather in 2015, but then, as you look out going forward, it would probably deteriorate because prices are below loss cost inflation? Is that a fair assumption, or am I off?\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Sarah, it wasn't so much weather in Business Insurance as it was a higher volume of large losses in the last three quarters of last year.\nSarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: And one of the reasons that we give outlook for three or four quarters is because it's just, our perspective beyond that gets unreliable, so I don't know. But what I would point you to is the way we've been able to manage returns across all three business segments over a long period of time throughout a bunch of different conditions. And so, you look at what Doreen and Greg and Michael have done in Personal Insurance by taking some difficult actions and repositioning that business and rolling out a new product; you look at what Tom Kunkel did in Bond & Specialty in a bunch of credit-sensitive businesses through a very difficult period in a financial crisis; think about what we've done in Business Insurance going back to 2010, when you look at the \u2013 we went back then, we looked at the outlook for returns and realized that we had to do some things differently. So your perspective that it might fall off beyond where we're giving guidance for suggests purely current course and speed. And I would say that we're current course and speed now because we like product returns, and when we get to a point in time where we don't like product returns, then we'll do different things. So I wouldn't necessarily draw the conclusion you were drawing. But I don't know for sure.\nSarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're all speculating beyond three or four quarters.\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: One of the other things that makes it very challenging is, we do talk about loss trend, and the loss trend is off of a starting point, and sometimes we adjust the starting point. You've heard us talk about base year movement. That comes about when we see favorable development and try to evaluate, well, what does that mean for the very loss picks that we had, that were the starting point for the loss trends that go forward. So it is, as Alan said, a pretty complicated set of variables that go into it, and the ability to look out much beyond three quarters or four quarters is a bit challenging.\nSarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just on, in Auto Insurance, the top line growth there was very strong. Could you just elaborate on what was driving that? And is that a level that we should view as sustainable?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Well, what we've talked about, Sarah, is that the percentages probably won't be the same, because our base is growing. And, as you probably recall, Quantum 2.0 rolled out over a couple of years, and even including three more states this year, California, North Carolina and Massachusetts. And so, we think that the percentage will moderate, but we're not anticipating that the product would be less competitive. We also are pleased to see, and so were our agents, that they're actually getting a disproportionate share of their new business from captives in the direct marketplace, which is something that we talked to them about. So, I would say the percentage, we definitely don't think will stay the same, but probably from a count perspective, we expect it to continue to perform at similar levels.\nSarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you for the answers.\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Uh huh.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.\nBrian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, thanks. A couple of just quick questions here, first, Doreen, I think you spoke at AFA (50:54) a little bit about increasing limits on homeowners. I'm just curious, kind of initial success you're having with that. How are agents responding?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Brian, let me just make sure that I reset, because what we talked about at AFA (51:14) was we had pilots underway with 10 agents in a couple of states and we took all of those suggestions: some, few coverage; a lot of process changes; and some guidance on pricing. And all of that work is getting done now.\nBrian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Okay.\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: So we're anticipating later in the year, beginning of 2017, that that would be broadly available. So all the work's being done, but it's not yet broadly in the marketplace.\nBrian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Is that going to require an increase in just your overhead expense, i.e. different types of claims adjusters as you get into that higher limit stuff; different types of underwriting, product, that kind of stuff?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: No, Brian. What we did as part of this assessment was looked at whether our current infrastructure, our current claim handling and our current product, could support that. We'll need to make a few tweaks to that, but we're not building this super high-end home capability. This is really the mass affluent and we think we have a really good match with our current capabilities in that marketplace.\nBrian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. And just a quick one for Jay; Jay, it looks like your pension expense down, earned benefits (52:39) down about $17 million on a year-over-year basis. Is that something we should expect kind of going forward? And where does that hit in your P&L?\nJay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: Okay. Well, in terms of the P&L, it's in a couple of places because pension expense, of course, relates to head count. And head count ends up in G&A as well as ULAE. So it's in more than one spot. But as it relates to, you know, what's taking place in the pension area, you may recall in the 10-K, we provided a disclosure saying that we were adopting a new methodology that went into the estimation of pension, and that dealt with using a yield curve approach rather than a spot rate for looking at the interest and service costs to coincide with how the PBO was being calculated. And that did have a benefit, and that'll be a benefit that carries on into the future.\nBrian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please proceed.\nMeyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I think this is for Doreen. When you have a quarter like this where catastrophes are a little bit higher, does that actually affect the G&A expense? I'm asking specifically homeowners, because that was down sequentially.\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Yeah, I didn't hear it.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it was about G&A expense?\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Yeah. No, not...\nJay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: No. Yeah, I think the answer is no, it doesn't really. There's obviously some claim expense that could be impacted, but...\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Right.\nJay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer: But in that case, nothing unusual this past quarter.\nDoreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance: Yeah. And the only thing down the road I would say about G&A is if we have a very, very profitable year in home, that's where we would add contingent commission, and so we'd be really happy if that went up because it was a great year.\nMeyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. And then more broadly speaking, I think you've mentioned the disruption in the marketplace a few times. Is there enough disruption out there to make it worthwhile to look at sort of building out the skill set into more specialty lines?\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, there's nothing about the current level of disruption that's causing us to look at that, in the sense that we look at that all the time. We're always looking for opportunities to expand our product set and to drive our competitive advantages and capabilities into new lines of business, new products. So we certainly don't wait for a moment in time to do that.\nMeyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, great. Thanks very much.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. And this will be our last question, please.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you. I guess question on the retention in Business Insurance; is it fair to say that this retention would have been at the upper end of what you might have expected given market conditions?\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah, Jay, this is Brian. Yeah. I mean, the 88% retention in Middle Market was very, very strong, and clearly would be at the upper end. We dissect where we're getting the retention. We feel great that it's about 90% in our best business. But it's our experience in the business would be that those are very tough levels to sustain.\nJay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: So given that, Brian, then did you guys ever think, gee, we could push a bit more on pricing, maybe let that retention settle in at a still phenomenal 84%, 85%? I know it's a tough balancing act, but is that part of your thought process?\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: So every single day in the marketplace, with every transaction, that's what our underwriters are doing. They're working with agents and brokers in the Middle Market and in the Other Business Insurance stuff account-by-account, and they're trying to determine what's the appropriate thing to do for that account. You can get caught up in the arithmetic of what you just said. And we do ourselves at times, but it's not as straight a line to say, well, if you reduce retention two points and you raise prices X, that's not exactly how the marketplace dynamics work. But we are always trying to look at the retention rate trade-off and looking at that in the context, first and foremost, of the return that we believe we're generating on that account or that book of business and is it appropriate and where do we want to go.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah.\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: So we're balancing it all the time.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would take you back to the conversation about account-by-account execution.\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: Yeah. The graph that Alan referenced in his opening comments and...\nJay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Got it. Well, thank you for the answer.\nBrian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer: Thank you.\nAlan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations: Great. Well, this completes our call. Thank you very much for joining us this morning. And as always, we're available in Investor Relations for any follow-up. Thank you and have a nice day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section of our website, travelers.com. Now, Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported fourth quarter core income of $633 million, generating a core return on equity of a little over 11%. That brings our full-year core income to $2.43 billion and full-year core return on equity to 9%. The fact that we were able to generate that level of profit and profitability given the extraordinary catastrophe losses for the industry this quarter and year on top of a decade of historically low interest rates and several years of a relatively soft pricing environment speaks to the earnings power of the franchise. It\u2019s the value of our competitive advantages, starting with underwriting excellence and investment expertise. For the year, catastrophe losses were manageable and we generated an after-tax underlying underwriting gain in excess of $1.2 billion and after-tax net investment income of nearly $1.9 billion. Our results and strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 4% during the year after returning $2.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders. As I\u2019ll share in a minute, we\u2019re encouraged about the outlook for 2018. Overall, we were pleased with our underlying combined ratio of 92.6% for the year, which was impacted by high levels of non-cat weather and non-cat fire-related losses relative to our expectations. Underneath that, our commercial businesses continue to perform well. For the year, business insurance delivered a strong underlying combined ratio of 94.9%. Bond and specialty insurance delivered an impressive underlying combined ratio of 83.2% even after a charge in the fourth quarter for a single surety loss outside the United States. In personal insurance, we were pleased with an underlying combined ratio in the quarter of 90.4%, bringing the full year to 91.5%. Those results reflect continued success in our leading property business, loss trends in personal auto within expectations, and the continued successful execution of the pricing and underwriting actions we\u2019ve been taking in the auto business all year. Notably, our consolidated expense ratio was down 80 basis points for the year as we grew earned premium by almost 5%, continued to invest in the strategic initiatives we discussed with you at our recent investor day, and delivered on our objective of improving productivity and efficiency, which resulted in about flat G&A expense dollars.  Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace execution which resulted in full-year net written premium growth of 5% to a record $26.2 billion. Importantly, in domestic business insurance in the quarter, renewal rate change reached 1.4 points, doubling from the third quarter, and renewal premium change reached 4 points. For both measures, that\u2019s the highest levels in about three years. Brian will give you more texture on the execution underneath the headlines, including a view by line, but I\u2019ll note that we achieved renewal rate gains in the quarter more broadly across our product portfolio and our accounts compared to recent periods. It\u2019s an acceleration of a trend in improved pricing we\u2019ve achieved over the past six quarters as the market started reacting to two things: first, the hurricanes and wildfires in the back half of the year; and second and more significant in my view, declining margins generally as interest rates remain at historically low levels and loss trend has outpaced rate and exposure for a few years now. As we\u2019ve doing all year and as I reiterated last quarter, we\u2019ll continue to seek rate thoughtfully and in close coordination with our agent and broker partners with the belief that our customers are well served by a stable and predictable market that keeps pace with inflation as opposed to more dramatic price swings of the past. Given our sense of the market and the fact that retentions remain at historic highs, we\u2019re encouraged. Aside from the pricing environment, new business in domestic business insurance was up in the quarter and for the year. We explained at our recent investor day that a number of the initiatives we have underway are designed to create more top line opportunities for us. It\u2019s still early days, but what we can see so far is positive. Our marketplace execution in both bond and specialty insurance and personal insurance was equally successful.  In our management liability business, we maintained retention at an impressive 88% throughout the year with stable renewal premium change and higher new business volume. Surety premium was higher both in the quarter and for the year as a result of an increase in large bond activity. Personal insurance finished the year with another quarter of accomplishing our objectives of improving auto profitability while maintaining momentum in our leading homeowners business. We achieved 11 points of renewal premium change in auto, enough to offset the bodily injury severity we identified in the second half of 2016 on a written basis, and delivered policy in force growth throughout the year in our homeowners business.  As it relates to the market generally, there has been a lot of speculation about how corporate tax reform will impact pricing. Stepping back, we price our products with return objectives in mind. The tax rate is just one factor impacting the pricing we need to achieve in order to reach our return objectives. Other factors, for example, include the adequacy of expiring prices, loss trends, expenses, the cost of reinsurance, the impact of claims initiatives and so on. Speaking for us, tax reform will help shrink the gap between where returns are trending and where we\u2019d like them to be trending, but it doesn\u2019t completely close the gap. Also, not every participant in the marketplace will benefit from tax reform, and even among those who do, the extent of the benefit varies. In short, for us tax reform helps, but we still have ground to cover. As I said a minute ago, we\u2019re encouraged about the outlook for 2018. We\u2019re well positioned to benefit from continued improvement in the pricing environment, the opportunities afforded by a more level playing field for domestic insurers as a result of tax reform, and the prospect of a strengthening economy. With that wind at our backs and from a position of strength, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our competitive advantages, focusing on extending our lead in risk expertise, improving the experience for our customers, agents and brokers, and enhancing productivity and efficiency. We believe we\u2019re well positioned to continue to create shareholder value. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks Alan. Core income was $633 million, down from $919 million in the prior year quarter, while core ROE was 11.1%, down from 16.4%. As has been the case all year, these reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by changes in our underlying performance. Our underlying performance remains strong and actually improved over the prior year quarter. Rather, these reductions were reflective of a continued high level of cat activity and the inclusion of an $82 million after-tax benefit in the prior year quarter from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute. The strength of our underlying underwriting results is evidenced by our consolidated underlying combined ratio of 92.4%, similar to the 92% we produced in the prior year quarter. Cat losses were $324 million after tax compared to only $89 million in the prior year quarter. This $235 million increase was driven by losses from the California wildfires of $426 million after tax, comprising $382 million after tax for the October wildfires in northern California and $44 million after tax for the December wildfires in southern California, partially offset by current year net favorable development of $102 million after tax for catastrophes that occurred earlier this year, almost all of which related to the third quarter hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.  For both Harvey and Irma, the benefits of our underwriting actions over many years, including management of overall exposure, limits and deductibles, resulted in more favorable claim outcomes than we had expected. For Maria, given that the storm occurred late in the third quarter and access to the impacted areas was extremely limited, our estimate was based on an exposure analysis. That initial estimate has come down due to our receiving fewer claims than we had expected.  Net favorable prior year reserve development, for which I\u2019ll provide more details shortly, was $192 million after tax, up from $172 million in the prior year quarter. Net investment income of $467 million after-tax, while continuing to be strong, was down $26 million from the prior year quarter. Non-fixed income NII decreased by $19 million after tax due to lower private equity returns which, although strong, were not as strong as in the prior year quarter. Fixed income NII, as anticipated, was lower by $8 million after tax due to the continued low interest rate environment. Taking into account long-term bonds that are scheduled to mature in 2018, growth in the size of our fixed income portfolio, higher short-term interest rates and the new U.S. tax law, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII for 2018 will be $25 million to $30 million higher quarter over quarter as compared to corresponding quarters in 2017, a significant improvement from recent years. Relative to what several other companies have disclosed, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 had a relatively modest impact on our fourth quarter results, a $129 million charge recorded as part of net income. This charge resulted mostly from revaluing our net deferred tax asset as of the enactment date using the new 21% tax rate and, to a lesser extent, providing on the taxes on the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings. I should also mention that we executed some tax-related actions in the fourth quarter that provided real economic benefits while having an insignificant impact on fourth quarter 2017 core and net income, but slightly increasing our fourth quarter consolidating combined ratio primarily through the expense ratio by about half a point. Under the new tax law, muni bond investment income will continue to be taxed at 5.25% while all other U.S.-based income will be taxed at 21% rather than 35%, so looking forward, you should update your models. Consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development was $293 million pre-tax compared to $264 million in the prior year quarter. Business insurance\u2019s net favorable reserve development was $244 million pre-tax compared to $221 million in the prior year quarter primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic workers comp and commercial multi-peril, partially offset by higher than expected loss experience in domestic commercial auto. Bond and specialty net favorable development was $42 million pre-tax compared to $79 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic management liability, while personal insurance had net favorable development of $7 million pre-tax compared to $36 million of net unfavorable development in the prior year quarter. For full year 2017, we had consolidated net favorable development of $592 million pre-tax. As in prior years, I\u2019m providing you with some insight into what our combined 2017 Schedule P is expected to show when filed on May 1. Excluding A&E, on a combined stat Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate developed favorably, and except for commercial auto liability, which developed unfavorably by $87 million pre-tax due to higher than expected bodily injury claims in recent accident years, all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development.  Page 19 of the webcast sets forth information about our January 1 cat treaty renewal. Our corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior year, but at a slightly higher cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad peril and geographic coverage and the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions, and note that the total cost of this treaty and therefore the slight cost increase are quite small in relation to our core income. Fourth quarter operating cash flows, which were impacted by the relatively high level of cat claim payments, were $538 million, bringing total operating cash flow to over $3.7 billion for the year. We ended the year with holding company liquidity of almost $1.3 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were over $1.4 billion pre-tax or $1.1 billion after tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $87.46 and adjusted book value per share of $83.36 increased 5% and 4% respectively from the beginning of the year.  Consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and despite the high level of cat losses, we were able to return $549 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter while maintaining our balance sheet strength through dividends of $198 million and share repurchases of $351 million, bringing total capital return to shareholders to over $2.2 billion in 2017. With me, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks Jay. Starting with this quarter\u2019s results in business insurance, segment income was strong at $637 million and the combined ratio for the quarter of 88.6% was flat to the prior year. Income was down from the prior year due primarily to the settlement of a reinsurance dispute in the fourth quarter of 2016. The underlying combined ratio for both the quarter and the full year was about a point higher than 2016. In both cases, the increase was driven by the loss ratio with loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing, while the full-year variance also reflects an unusually high number of large non-cat fire losses in 2017. The full-year expense ratio of 31.9% was half a point lower than the prior year. As Jay mentioned, the fourth quarter included the impact of some tax-related actions, so the full year is a better indication of our expense run rate. Net written premiums of $3.4 billion for the quarter were up about 5% year-over-year with domestic net written premiums up about 4%, driven by continued strong production results in middle market. International net written premiums were up 15% or 11% excluding the impact of the change in foreign currency rates. The growth in international was driven by strong production results in Europe and Canada, along with some normal fluctuations in the Lloyd\u2019s volume. Turning to domestic production, we were very pleased with our results in the quarter. Renewal rate change was 1.4% and renewal premium change was 4%, and as Alan said, for both the highest the level in about three years. Retention remained at a historically high level of 85% and new business was strong for the quarter at $478 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2016.  Looking at the individual businesses, in select, production remains strong with renewal premium change for the quarter of over 5%, retention of 83%, and new business premiums of $100 million up 11% year-over-year. In middle market, renewal rate change increased to 1.5%, up about a point year-over-year, and renewal premium change increased to 3.6%. Retention remained at a historically high level of 87% while new business premiums of $298 million were up 17% versus the prior year quarter. In terms of new business, the technology, tools and process changes we\u2019ve been rolling out over the last several years that we discussed at our recent day have allowed us to be more active in our targeted industry segments. In select, we\u2019re generating more submissions and quotes and having success in closing those incremental opportunities. In middle markets, we\u2019ve been successful in quoting more while also closing more large accounts than a year ago. While the normal volatility in writing large accounts was a factor in this quarter\u2019s growth, we believe our initiatives are beginning to have an impact. For the aggregate, production results were very strong, but as we have said many times, the aggregate numbers alone don\u2019t tell the entire story. The detail of where we are getting rate and what accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our execution, and looking at the results below the headline numbers we couldn\u2019t be more pleased. For example, as you would expect, there was significant line of business texture below the headline production numbers.  In terms of pricing, workers compensation, a line that has had strong returns in recent periods, had renewal premium change that was positive but lower than a year ago. Conversely, commercial auto, which is a challenge from a return perspective line, had the highest positive price change in the quarter, well above loss trends. What\u2019s also encouraging to us is that across all the other major product lines - property, GL, C&P, and umbrella, renewal premium change was positive and up both year-over-year and sequentially. Importantly, we were able to achieve these pricing increases while maintaining strong retention and growing new business. There was also significant texture based on individual account performance. We continue to be pleased that we are retaining our best performing business, as evidenced by retention rates in excess of 90% for our best performing middle market accounts. In addition, pricing in the quarter improved across the continuum of middle market book, most significantly in our poor performing accounts where we achieved rate increases well in excess of loss trends. Finally, in addition to what we\u2019re seeing in the numbers, we\u2019re also encouraged that there has been some tightening of terms and conditions for catastrophe-exposed risks.  So all in, a great quarter and end to the year. We were very pleased with our execution in the marketplace and how we are positioned for continued success in 2018.  Before turning to bond and specialty, and I want to comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won\u2019t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017 assuming lower and more normalized levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other loss activity. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward-looking statement disclaimers. In bond and specialty insurance, segment income for the quarter was $112 million, down from the prior year quarter due to the international surety charge that Alan mentioned as well as a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. In surety, losses are episodic and we remain pleased with the quality of our book. The underlying combined ratio increased from the prior year quarter to 91.1%, reflecting the impact of the surety charge. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 5%, reflecting growth in both our domestic surety and management liability businesses. Surety growth was driven by a higher level of large bond activity in the quarter. Turning to production in our domestic management liability businesses, we continue to execute our strategy of growing our profitable portfolio by retaining our best performing accounts and writing new business in return adequate product segments, so we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that retention came in at a strong 88% for the quarter while new business was up 17% from the fourth quarter of last year. Renewal premium change of 3.4% was up slightly from the third quarter. Bond and specialty results were solid, and we continue to feel great about our market position. In terms of outlook for 2018, we expect that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2018 will be broadly consistent with the same period of 2017. In the last quarter of 2018, we expect that underlying underwriting margins will be higher and the underlying combined ratio will be lower than in the same period of 2017.  Turning to personal insurance, net written premiums for the segment grew 8% in the quarter driven by higher pricing primarily in auto and modest PIF growth primarily in homeowners. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were approximately $200 million after tax, above both prior year and our normal expectations, resulting in a $50 million loss for the quarter and a combined ratio of 108.7%. For the full year despite pre-tax cat losses of more than $1 billion, personal insurance generated $128 million of income. The underlying combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 90.4% improved by 3.2 points compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, and the full-year underlying combined ratio of 91.5% was about half a point higher than full-year 2016. The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 103%, including a 1.1 point benefit from catastrophe losses as we reduced our auto estimate related to Hurricane Harvey. The underlying combined ratio of 104.1% improved by 8.1 points from the prior year. As you can see on Page 15 of the webcast, 4.7 points of the decrease is due to last year\u2019s fourth quarter having been elevated as a result of the year-to-date impact of the bodily injury loss re-estimation. The remainder of the improvement is primarily as a result of earned rate from filing actions we have taken over the past year now exceeding loss trends by several points, in line with the planned actions we outlined a year ago. I would remind you that seasonality inflates the absolute value of the fourth quarter combined ratio.  As we have continued to take actions to improve profitability in the auto book, renewal premium change increased to 10.6% in the fourth quarter. Retention declined modestly, as expected, given the pricing actions, and PIF growth has leveled out, again in line with our plans. We were pleased with the level of written rate in 2017 and looking ahead, we expect that full-year RPC for 2018 will be broadly consistent with the full-year 2017 result as we look to continue to improve the profitability of the book. Turning to agency, homeowners and other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 115.3% included over 45 points from cat losses, driven by the wildfires in California. The underlying combined ratio of 70.2% for the quarter was consistent with the prior year quarter as higher non-cat weather losses were basically offset by an improvement in the expense ratio. For the full year, the abnormally high cat result of 23.6 points drove the combined ratio up to 100.7%, while the underlying combined ratio of 77.1% was about a point and a half above the prior year due primarily to higher non-cat weather losses. Homeowners volume continued to exhibit momentum with healthy PIF growth throughout the year to finish up 5.5% compared to the prior year-end. We\u2019re pleased that our focus on generating growth in this product line has enabled us to steadily increase property PIF count even as we have intentionally slowed the PIF growth in auto. We\u2019re also pleased to have introduced our newest property product, Quantum Home 2.0, in three pilot states during the fourth quarter with initial response from agents and customers in line with our expectations.  Overall in personal insurance, while the headlines were all about the significant catastrophe losses, we feel great about having achieved the goals we had established entering 2017. In addition, we continued our ongoing expense discipline, which resulted in slightly lower G&A expenses while delivering 9% growth in net written premiums for the segment, reducing the full year expense ratio by 1.5 points. So for personal insurance in 2017, we were very pleased with the execution on the key elements needed to position this segment for success in 2018. Finally as it relates to our outlook for the personal insurance segment as a whole, we expect underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017.  Stepping back to the enterprise, we generated over $2 billion in profits in a year that was dominated by the impact of weather and large losses, so we feel good about the result but, more importantly, feel great about the execution across all our businesses and our market position entering 2018. With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Before we go to the Q&A portion, Alan has a few additional words.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks Gabby. As bittersweet as it is, we have one last piece of business before we open it up for questions. I just want to acknowledge and thank Brian MacLean, who will be retiring at the end of March after a spectacular 30-year career and, after today, something like 53 consecutive earnings calls. He\u2019d never take credit for it, but we owe so much of what we\u2019ve accomplished over so many years to him. He\u2019s been a great colleague to so many and he\u2019s been an important partner and friend to me. Thank you, Brian. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKai Pan: Thank you, good morning. First, congratulations to Brian for three decades at Travelers and best wishes for your retirement. That doesn\u2019t count as a question, so my first question is on pricing. So there is a saturation of BI pricing, and you mentioned that your outlook for 2018 the BIs lower underlying combined ratio, but the 1.4% increase is still lower than the general loss cost trend of 3 to 4%. Just wondering what\u2019s behind the scenes that you expect the pricing to accelerate.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes Kai, good morning, it\u2019s Alan. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s all the things that we talked to you about quarter over quarter in terms of our ability to pull levers and manage profitability, and I\u2019ll remind you that exposure is a piece of that, and that significant portion of exposure contributes to it, but so does selection and mix and the way we segment and the way we price the product claims handling, risk control, expense management. All of those things contribute to our outlook on profitability in the underlying combined ratio.\nKai Pan: Okay, then my follow-up is on the tax rate. What\u2019s your overall effective tax rate for the corporation in 2018, and Alan, from your comments it looks like most of the tax benefit will flow through to the bottom line.\nJay Benet: This is Jay Benet. The reason I gave you the pieces is that the effective tax rate is always going to be a function of the relationship of the tax-exempt interest to the total interest, so in whatever modeling you\u2019re doing, you need to come up with what you believe the tax exempt interest is going to be, apply a 5.25 tax rate to that, and then everything else that\u2019s U.S. domestic will be at the 21% rate. So the effective tax rate is going to move, but again that\u2019s the way of calculating it.\nAlan Schnitzer: Kai, just reflecting back on your other question, you were talking about the pricing outlook, and I would just remind you that, as Brian shared with you, that assumes that in BI, the non-cat weather and elevated fire losses, and for that matter in PI, the non-cat weather will both return to normal levels by historical standards. Obviously weather and large losses are going to be what they\u2019re going to be, but the outlook reflects that as well. In terms of the benefit from tax reform and what\u2019s going to happen to it, we--as I tried to express in my prepared remarks, it goes into the mix of everything else that we use to generate the prices we need, so yes, I do think that it will fall to the bottom line.\nKai Pan: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks. Just for Alan, and a follow-up to Kai\u2019s question, just thinking about the fact that last quarter we had a 2018 outlook for broadly consistent margins, and now three months later the outlook is they\u2019ll improve, just wanted to drill down a little further on what it is you\u2019ve seen over the last three months, because I think your outlook on pricing then was also pretty positive. But I guess over the last three months, what\u2019s given you more confidence to really think that margins will be better?\nAlan Schnitzer: You\u2019ve got to remember that when we talk about underwriting margins, we\u2019re talking about dollars, and combined ratio we\u2019re talking about combined ratio points. That\u2019s a function of the written volume, for example, and everything else that goes into the mix, so it\u2019s a combination of all the things that impact margins and combined ratio. I\u2019m not sure how else to express that.\nRyan Tunis: Okay. I guess just on auto, then, I think what you said is you think that RPC will be a similar level to this year as it was last year, and it seemed like this year, it was several points above loss trend. If you could just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing there, because that sounds like a decent amount of rain. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a severity uptick beyond what you expected, or something along those lines. Thanks.\nMichael Klein: Hey Ryan, it\u2019s Michael Klein. Thanks for the question. The short answer is no, it doesn\u2019t reflect anything beyond what we expected. It\u2019s just the follow-on steps in our existing game plan, and I think when you think about pricing, think of it in three pieces, so the written rate we\u2019re going to achieve in 2018 is partly based on the rate we have already filed in addition to the rate we\u2019ll file in \u201918, and so that drives a lot of our rate outlook. What I think you\u2019ll see as you look ahead to 2018 is RPC in the first half of the year will be higher than the numbers you see on the page from the first half of 2017, and the back half of the year will be lower than the numbers you see for the back half of \u201917. Importantly, on an earned basis since written rate has accelerated through \u201917, earned rate will actually rise in 2018 relative to 2017, so that\u2019s sort of the way that we think about it. But no, the broadly consistent RPC outlook doesn\u2019t reflect anything unanticipated in our loss experience.\nRyan Tunis: That\u2019s helpful, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks and good morning. Maybe just staying on personal auto with Michael Klein, you gave some good color on RPC. How should we think about the PIF growth from here, just based on the fact that a majority of your book is 12 months? When should we see some change in that number down the road?\nMichael Klein: Thanks Amit, appreciate the question. I think if you think about just the broad themes on auto, what we talked about in 2017, our objective was to improve profitability and manage growth, manage meaning being reduced. As we think about our objective for \u201918, it\u2019s really to try to achieve more balance between growth and profitability in auto, and I think you can certainly see as we talked about last quarter, we felt like we turned the corner on auto profitability in the third quarter. You\u2019re seeing in the year-on-year adjusted underlying combined comparison that improvement accelerating, but again consistent with our RPC outlook, still work to do there. So again, we\u2019re looking to achieve a balance between profitability and growth in \u201918, and then as that profitability continues to improve, we\u2019ll look to resume growth. But right now, we\u2019re trying to level off and then move it forward.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks, that\u2019s actually helpful. My follow-up, switching back to commercial lines, I know there was some good texture on the pricing change. I\u2019m curious, if we were to step back and think about the active cat quarter for Q3 and Q4 and its impact on the marketplace, would you say that it\u2019s early days for, I guess, a broad-based firming of the small and middle commercial market, or is it more isolated near term?\nAlan Schnitzer: Amit, it\u2019s Alan. You know, we tried to give you a perspective by line to really address that because putting workers\u2019 comp aside, and that is its own story, the price increases we were able to achieve in the quarter were broader than just the properly lines. As I shared in my prepared remarks, I think the more significant factor driving the pricing is where margins were, certainly for us, and that\u2019s probably true relative to the industry. So you know, I can\u2019t tell you exactly what the industry is going to do or what\u2019s going to happen, but I can tell you what we\u2019re going to do, and that\u2019s to thoughtfully and in close coordination with our agent and broker partners continue to push for rate where we need it to improve the outlook and trend of returns.\nAmit Kumar: Okay, I\u2019ll stop here. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question, in terms of the margin outlook for business insurance for next year, can you quantify the impact that non-cat weather had this year so we know what to adjust for when thinking about \u201918? In your margin outlook, how are you thinking about the expense ratio versus the loss ratio as we think about you potentially earning in better rate next year?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey Elyse, this is Greg Toczydlowski from Business Insurance. In terms of your first question, think about a point in terms of where large losses and non-cat weather are relative to our longer term expectations for 2017, and that would be a good way to think about a going forward perspective. \nAlan Schnitzer: Elyse, on your question about expenses, we\u2019re going to try to resist the temptation to break out the go-forward perspective on the loss ratio versus the expense ratio. We give you an outlook on the combined ratio, at least qualitatively, because you get into some judgements and a level of precision that is probably further than we\u2019d like to go, at least from an outlook perspective. Jay Benet did say in his opening remarks, or maybe it was Brian, that looking at the full year was probably a better perspective on the outlook, and I will add, just following up on our comments at our recent investor day, that productivity and efficiency are important strategic initiatives for us. We\u2019ve seen that benefit of that this year. We\u2019ve got real productivity and efficiency enhancements on the shop floor right now, and we think there\u2019s more to come, and what that does for us, it\u2019s not necessarily that we\u2019re trying to dial in a much lower expense ratio. What we\u2019re trying to do is create all the benefits that come from operating leverage, so we can take those incremental dollars and, as I\u2019ve said before, we can let them fall to the bottom line, we can use it to invest in important strategic capabilities, or we can put it into pricing, and it really is that flexibility that we\u2019re looking for going forward. But in terms of the outlook, we\u2019re going to stick with the broader commentary on overall margins.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. My second question, in terms of the pricing environment, going back to business insurance again, you said in your opening remarks that you want rates to keep pace with inflation. What are you pegging inflation at right now within your commercial lines book, and when you make that comment, I guess that\u2019s what we should compare when we think about the RPC going forward within business insurance? \nAlan Schnitzer: Yes Elyse, we\u2019ve said for a long time that our long-term outlook, and again that\u2019s long-term perspective for all of business insurance, is about 4%, and really no change on that. There\u2019s some texture underneath by line, for example. I\u2019m not sure what your question was about RPC, but rate contributes to margin, and there\u2019s a portion of exposure that\u2019s obviously part of RPC that also contributes to it, so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the texture and color you were looking for.\nElyse Greenspan: I guess what I was thinking about was your RPC was about 4% in the quarter, and then you were saying that inflation was about 4%, but then to your commentary it seems like you are pushing for more price across your book of business from where we were at in the fourth quarter, so I was just trying to tie those two comments together. \nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, so Elyse, I would say think of RPC as having two components - one, pure rate, and two, exposure. Of the piece that\u2019s exposure, a portion of that behaves like margin and there\u2019s a portion of it that has real loss content in it and doesn\u2019t. So you know, RPC needs to be above the overall loss trend in order for us to consider margins to be expanding, and you could look at those numbers and you\u2019d say, at least on a written basis, we\u2019re getting close. Although, we do think--I do think over time that insurance like most other businesses, pricing ought to keep up with inflation, but I would say that given where we are now and in terms of the outlook and trend for returns, we\u2019re looking to do a little bit better than just offset inflation, were looking to expand margin.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nYaron Kinar: Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is with regards to the rate increases in business insurance. If I strip out commercial auto, I think if my calculation is correct, I get to roughly flat rate for the rest of the business. Am I thinking about that correctly, or are there maybe areas or lines where you are getting more rates outside of commercial auto?\nJay Benet: Yes Yaron, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing the math entirely correctly. There\u2019s a lot of different pieces underneath the net written premium change, which I think you\u2019re trying to back into, so we\u2019re certainly, as Alan said earlier, very much focused on where some of the more distressed lines are - automobile and the catastrophic exposed areas of property, but we\u2019re also pushing ahead on all the products, so the math doesn\u2019t come out where we\u2019re flat on all the other product lines.\nAlan Schnitzer: I would just direct you back to Brian\u2019s comments where he gave you a view of pricing by line, so price is positive in every line outside of workers\u2019 comp, higher both sequentially and year-over-year. We can follow up with you and walk you through the math if that\u2019s helpful.\nYaron Kinar: Yes, we\u2019ll do that. Then one other question on tax reform. Alan, if I understand your comments correct, basically you\u2019re looking at the results of--you\u2019re targeting a certain return, and tax reform ends up helping that return. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of are you expecting any change in investment allocation that would further boost or decrease the impact of tax reform?\nAlan Schnitzer: Let me turn that over to Bill Heyman and ask him to respond to that.\nBill Heyman: I think it was possible there will be over time some reallocation. The elimination of corporate AMT removed a ceiling in terms of the amount of municipals we can own, although that\u2019s very theoretical. Every day we look at what the market throws up in terms of assuming roughly equal credit quality, which is rarely the case, where is the highest after-tax return. I think going forward, that will more often in certain segments of the curve be in taxables rather than municipals. It may even be that we buy taxables and sell municipals in certain parts of the curve, and the reason for that is for the first time I can remember, individual investors and corporate investors have very different utility functions, so at many parts of the curve your municipal is not worth as much to us as it used to be, but it\u2019s worth more to an individual investor than it is to us. So there may be opportunities to pick up after-tax yield on advantageous terms, but obviously we can\u2019t guarantee them or quantify them. But I suspect if you looked at the portfolio three years now, the mix would have changed.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. \nPaul Newsome : I wanted to ask whether or not the outlook for M&A for Travelers has changed with tax reform. Does it make it easier or more interesting to buy something outside the U.S. for Travelers?\nAlan Schnitzer: Good morning, Paul. What I can tell you is that tax reform for us and others who are similarly situated obviously just makes us a more competitive buyer relative to a non-U.S. taxpayer who previously had the benefit of some structural advantages, structural tax advantages. Those advantages have gone away, so that levels the playing field, so relatively speaking we\u2019re a more competitive buyer, so that\u2019s changed for sure. What hasn\u2019t changed, Paul, is either our lens or our propensity to do transactions, and by that I mean we are always looking for opportunities, both organic and inorganic, and when we can make them happen on terms that are attractive to us, we\u2019re going to try hard to do that. As I\u2019ve said before and just to reiterate it, we\u2019re going to try to do deals when it improves our return profile, lowers our volatility, or provides us with other important strategic benefits, so maybe our positioning relative to others changes but our lens or propensity doesn\u2019t. The other thing that won\u2019t change is our capital management strategy. We will continue to think about and allocate capital the same way we have historically. I guess given tax reform and all other things being equal, there\u2019s probably higher earnings and capital to put to through that capital management filter, but our thought process around capital management doesn\u2019t change.\nPaul Newsome: That\u2019s it for me, thanks. Congrats on the quarter.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb: Thank you. My first question is on capital deployment in 2018. Should we still consider 100% of operating earnings as being deployable for share buybacks and dividends, absent another opportunity emerging?\nJay Benet: Hi Jay, it\u2019s Jay. As Alan just said, the way we think about capital management hasn\u2019t changed, so we\u2019re always going to try to fund growth, we\u2019re always going to look for opportunities to create shareholder value, and to the extent that we continue to create excess capital, we\u2019ll manage it the same way - returning it to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and the driver of that is the earnings of the play. So no change there, and what we\u2019ve said in the 10-K and the 10-Q all along with regard to that still holds.\nJay Gelb: I appreciate that. Then if I can try one on tax, using your supplement, if I look at the tax-free municipal income and apply the rate you mentioned, I guess I get kind of driven down to a 15.5 to 16% overall effective tax rate. Am I in the neighborhood on that? \nJay Benet: If the calculation you\u2019re doing is looking at the supplement, taking some view as to what the average asset base would be for the munis, applying the rate that we show in the supplement as the earnings rate on that, you\u2019ll get the pre-tax muni NII, apply 5.25% to that, and you\u2019ll have that component of the tax accrual, and then the rest, whatever you\u2019re assuming with regard to the non-muni income, not just NII but underwriting, apply the 21% to and you\u2019ll get an effective tax rate.\nJay Gelb: Okay, thanks Jay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next call is a question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJay Cohen: Thank you - back-to-back Jays. A couple of questions. First is the surety premiums went up. You said there was more activity. Do you see this being a function of the economy, and should we expect the top line on the surety side to possibly expand, especially if we\u2019ve got more infrastructure spending?\nTom Kunkel: Jay, this is Tom Kunkel, good morning. I think the way we\u2019re looking at the surety production in the month is it really can be episodic, and those are some very well performing businesses and accounts that we were doing that volume with but I wouldn\u2019t say that we in any way view it as indicative as an increase in activity for the type of work that drives surety bonding. So as they say, a little lumpy.\nJay Cohen: Got it. Other question, on the commercial lines market, your effort to raise prices a bit more aggressively has been met with a retention that has stayed at a historically high level. It suggests the rest of the market is coming along as well, and I\u2019m wondering if you could speak qualitatively about what you\u2019re hearing from agents and brokers regarding how your competitors are responding to the same pressures that you are.\nAlan Schnitzer: Jay, it\u2019s Alan. We don\u2019t talk a lot to our distribution partners about the way our competitors price. It\u2019s a competitive marketplace, and they do what they do and we do what we do. I will tell you that just in terms of our process, we do a lot of work and we\u2019ve got a lot of talent out there in the field, and our underwriters are out talking to our distribution partners about accounts 90, 120 days out to make sure that we\u2019re working in partnership with them and making sure that we\u2019re sharing with our customers why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing. So you know, we\u2019ve got, I think just a tremendous field organization and I think they\u2019ve done a great job. Obviously we do operate in a competitive marketplace, and so I do think that what you see in our results is to some degree a reflection of the market. I\u2019ve always thought that there are probably two reasons that maybe we have a little bit of incremental pricing power. One is just the franchise value we bring to the marketplace in product breadth and risk control and claims--an unbelievable claims organization, and I think that our agent and broker partners are proud to sell that and I think our customers see value in it.  The other advantage I think we have to some degree is data analytics. It\u2019s about risk selection and pricing, and we\u2019ve been a pioneer for a long time in not just data analytics but delivering that data and analytics to the screen of the local underwriter at the point of sale. So I do think those two things probably give us a little bit of an advantage, but certainly there is a marketplace dynamic to what we\u2019re able to achieve.\nJay Cohen: Got it, thanks Alan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Two quick questions here for you. The first one, I\u2019m just curious, could we parse a little bit business insurance as far as what\u2019s going on from a rate perspective? I\u2019m just curious, when small commercial, not a lot of rate, it just doesn\u2019t need it, more competitive pressures, and also on your large ticket property business, that\u2019s one that you had excluded a while from your rate calculations because it\u2019s so competitive, how is that trending now and maybe relative to your expectations? And then I have one follow-up.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Brian, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start with the small commercial one. We\u2019ve been focusing on the small commercial business for a number of years now, really trying to get the margins to a place where we feel very comfortable with them, and we are very much within our target thresholds of where we want to be from a small commercial, so we\u2019ve had a deliberate set of execution around our rate plan there, so that\u2019s the first element around why you see a smaller level of rate in small than middle. The second one really is around our express business, which think of it as the straight through processing of small commercial, really has a more prescriptive flat rating environment, and so when we see some of the pressures of rate reductions in workers\u2019 comp given the extraordinarily profitability on that line over time, we see that more immediately impact that business. Those are the two reasons that are driving the small commercial.\nBrian Meredith: And on the property, large account property? \nGreg Toczydlowski: What was your question on the large property?\nBrian Meredith: How is that--the large account property, how is that playing out from a rate perspective right now? Is it getting the rate that you kind of need in that area, or not?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Given the hurricanes were in the third quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with our agility one quarter in, in terms of what we\u2019ve been trying to do on the national property side. As Alan said, we think franchise value matters, and we\u2019re seeing that inside our numbers where we\u2019ve been able to push thoughtfully and, at the same time, retain the book of business.\nJay Benet: Brian, just one comment on top of that. Looking back over significant cat events over the years, the impact in the large property book on rate is usually two, three, even sometimes four quarters out, the peak of that, so we\u2019re optimistic that there could be more to come, but that\u2019s just looking at the historical trends. \nAlan Schnitzer: And we made good progress in the quarter.\nJay Benet: Yes.\nBrian Meredith: Great, and then just on personal lines, and just on tax, I appreciate the comments on how it\u2019s going to fall to the bottom line, but I guess my question more on the personal line space is as you look out, understanding you need more rate to get to the right returns that you really want in that business, but should we expect that kind of your combined ratios, where you\u2019d like them to get, are going to be higher here going forward as a result of tax, and specifically related to at least certain states have return on capital type benchmarks that they look at, is there going to be pushback from those regulators on returns here with tax reform?\nMichael Klein: Brian, it\u2019s Michael. Thanks for the question. I would say where you started is probably where we start, which is we\u2019re not at target returns yet and we\u2019ve got work to do. I think consistent with Alan\u2019s comments in the opening, a lower tax rate sort of helps move us closer but doesn\u2019t get us all the way there, so when you think about it from a filed rate and a regulatory standpoint, we certainly see and actually have seen just this week news from some regulators on the fact that they are thinking about the tax rate and looking to apply it in some of those conversations, but generally speaking it doesn\u2019t change the direction we need to move rates, particularly in auto. We still have work to do there to get to target returns, and we\u2019re going to continue down that path.\nBrian Meredith: Right, it\u2019s just the magnitude you need going forward is probably less today than it would have been before tax reform?\nMichael Klein: I would say all else being equal, but again to Alan\u2019s point earlier, you\u2019ve got expenses, you\u2019ve got loss experience, you\u2019ve got investment yield, a whole bunch of things that go into that mix, and it\u2019s just one factor that we need to consider.\nBrian Meredith: Great, thanks for the answer. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette and & Woods. Please proceed.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m over-thinking this, but I guess I was surprised that the outlook for 2018 for personal insurance was only a slightly lower combined ratio with auto earned rates likely to approach double digits. Am I missing something there?\nMichael Klein: Meyer, this is Michael. Thanks for the question, and appreciate it because Brian did give you the overall outlook for the segment, but there\u2019s a little bit of texture underneath. So if you think about auto specifically when you see the 10-K outlook, what you\u2019re going to see is our commentary there is for improved margins and combined ratio. The home outlook, on the other hand, is broadly consistent both from a margin and a combined ratio standpoint, assuming more normalized levels of non-cat weather activity. When you put those two pieces together, you get improved margins and a slightly improved combined ratio in the aggregate. Part of that, I guess the other factor is as auto premium is growing more than home, and auto carries a higher combined ratio, mix impacts the adjustment in the combined ratio. \nMeyer Shields: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks. Second, I guess this is a broader question. You\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about how some elements of exposure act like rate. Are those elements more, I guess, reflective of the price of the exposure to the values that are being insured, or of exposure unit growth or on a real basis?\nAlan Schnitzer: I\u2019m not totally sure I understand the question, but I think it\u2019s more of a value than it is unit, right? You increase the value of a unit and it\u2019s that increase in exposure that behaves more like rate. When you actually add another unit of exposure, you have another unit of loss content, so I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That\u2019s exactly what I was asking.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Dewitt with JP Morgan. Please proceed.\nSarah Dewitt: Hey, good morning. Wanted to try one more on the tax rate. What would the pro forma tax rate have been this year under U.S. tax reform?\nJay Benet: Actually, it\u2019s not something we actually calculated, so I think we would suggest you do the same thing - just look at what the NII was for the tax exempt portfolio and then for everything else, apply the 21% rate. But we haven\u2019t done the calculation.\nSarah Dewitt: Okay. Yes, I\u2019m coming up with some slightly different numbers than in the previous question, so just--I mean, if you were willing to disclose that, I think that would be helpful.\nJay Benet: Well just to add, the information is in the supplement, so maybe it\u2019s something Gabby can follow up with you on.\nSarah Dewitt: Okay, great. Thank you. Then secondly, just on the auto insurance underlying combined ratio, it improved nicely this quarter but it\u2019s still above 100. How long should we be thinking about it will take to get below 100, given some of the pricing actions you\u2019re taking offset by the new business penalty?\nMichael Klein: Thanks Sarah, it\u2019s Michael. I want to just put a point on Brian\u2019s comment earlier about reflecting seasonality to start with. So if you\u2019re looking at Page 15 and you\u2019re looking at the 101 for the full year versus the 104 for the quarter, that is pretty consistent with the seasonality we would typically see in the quarter. In terms of how long it takes, I think we\u2019re certainly optimistic, and as we said last quarter, we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making towards our target combined ratio and see that continuing as we look ahead into \u201918 and \u201919.  I think with the outlook that we\u2019ve given you for RPC, you can sort of make your own estimate of what the earned rate will be, apply a loss trend and get to an earned combined ratio pretty quickly, and I guess at this point as we look at our experience, we don\u2019t see anything that would cause us to tell you to do it any differently. \nSarah Dewitt: Okay, great.\nJay Benet: Just as a follow-up to your tax question, in terms of the going forward approach to calculating an effective tax rate, what I said is absolutely on point - there is a little bit of foreign income that\u2019s taxed at a slightly different rate, but that shouldn\u2019t matter. That will matter more this year than in the future because of today\u2019s 35% tax rate versus the future.  But one of the other things that we should point out, and you\u2019ll see it in the press release, we did have a favorable tax settlement earlier in the year that would have affected this year\u2019s effective tax rate, so if you\u2019re going to a pro forma for this year, you have to take that into account. Then in addition to that, I mentioned in my commentary that we did some tax planning initiatives in the year that had some impact on the effective tax rate as well, so really the calculation you want to do is not about this year, it\u2019s about going forward.\nSarah Dewitt: Okay, great. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay, this will be our last question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed.\nLarry Greenberg: Thank you. If you can believe it, I still have a question to ask. So going back to tax reform and the level playing field, aside from the benefits that might be there on the M&A side, from an operating standpoint or from a business line standpoint, where do you think the most concrete benefits might arise given the more level playing field?\nAlan Schnitzer: You know, I guess the way we think about that is the tax line is an expense line like any other expense line that we work into our pricing models, and to the extent that we\u2019ve got a level playing field and aren\u2019t at a disadvantage in that regard, I think again on a relative basis from a pricing perspective, that helps. I would say after M&A, and maybe even before M&A, that that\u2019s a significant factor in terms of a level playing field.\nLarry Greenberg: But in terms of business insurance, specific lines, there is none that necessarily jump out more than others? \nAlan Schnitzer: I think the same math applies to all of our pricing models for all of our products, so I don\u2019t think I would make a distinction there. \nLarry Greenberg: Okay. Then just with better economic growth perhaps on the horizon, do you think that all things equal, small commercial premium growth should maybe catch up to the middle market and maybe even grow faster in an improving economic environment?\nAlan Schnitzer: I\u2019m not really sure how to answer that question. I do think across all of our businesses, we\u2019re pretty well leveraged and pretty well positioned to benefit from an improving economic environment. In terms of--you know, if you\u2019re asking about growth in GDP by small enterprise versus large, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve got a better view on that than you or anyone else. If you\u2019re talking about our own market position, small versus large, there\u2019s so many things that go into growth and we actually don\u2019t think about it that way. We execute, as you\u2019ve heard us say many times, at a very granular level, so whether it\u2019s small or large, we\u2019re trying to keep our best business, improve the profitability on the business where we need to, and do a lot of hustle in leveraging our competitive advantages, trying to generate new business. When that very granular strategy adds up to growth, we grow, so that\u2019s the way I think about it and we don\u2019t really think about the small differently than the large from that perspective.\nLarry Greenberg: Great, thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the presentation back to Ms. Nawi. Please proceed.\nGabriella Nawi: Excellent. Thank you all for joining us today, and as always, if you have any additional questions, we are available in Investor Relations. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 19, 2017. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our third quarter 2017 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, Chief Operating Officer. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. In addition, other members of senior management are in the room, including Bill Heyman, Chief Investment Officer; Michael Klein, President of Personal Insurance; Tom Kunkel, President of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Greg Toczydlowski, President of Business Insurance. Before I turn it over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that available in the Investors section on our website travelers.com. And now, Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $293 million or $1.05 per diluted share and core income of $253 million or $0.91 per diluted share. The fact that we made a considerable profit in one of the costliest hurricane seasons on record demonstrates the earning power of our franchise which is built on strong foundation of underwriting and investment expertise. This is reflected in our manageable catastrophe losses, underlying underwriting gain of $292 million and after-tax net investment income of $457 million. Our catastrophe losses were well within what we would expect from the events in the quarter. Balancing risk and reward to generate leading results over time is in our DNA. While that's evident in our results this quarter, our underwriting discipline would have been even more evident if Hurricane Irma had taken the track to Miami up the East Coast of Florida which was projected just 48 hours before landfall. Notwithstanding 10 years of relatively moderate Atlantic storm activity, our investors should know we were well positioned for the very realty possibility of $150 billion industry event. That's not to say we'll never have a substantial or even an outsized loss from an event, its just to say that balancing risk and reward is always front and center for us. Our catastrophe underwriting also incorporates lessons learned over the years from events like hurricane Katrina and superstorm Sandy. Those lessons are reflected in our disciplined approach to terms and conditions which make outcomes more predictable, risk control initiatives, which make a difference in risk mitigation, selection, and pricing, and proprietary flood underwriting down to the address level. Our experience with the storms this quarter also reaffirms the competitive advantage in our claim model in terms of the value it delivers to our customers and agents and for our shareholders. Through military-like logistics capabilities and a sophisticated cross-training strategy, we have the capacity to conduct and we did conduct virtually 100% of our claim inspections for hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria with Travelers employees and that would have been the case even if Irma had taken that East Coast of Florida track, and even in that scenario our flexible model would have given us capacity to spare. As compared to an independent adjuster, we\u2019re confident that a highly trained and committed Travelers claim professional produces a better experience for our customers and a much more efficient outcome for us. To that point, we were successful this hurricane season in meeting our objective of having the vast majority of our property claims closed within 30 days of the event. Our response to the storms also included our largest deployment of our drilling fleet to date. We conducted more than a thousand inspections with drones, which significantly accelerates the speed and reduces the cost of handling those claims. Again, a better outcome for our customers and more efficient outcome for us. We own and operate all of our drones and we're on track to have more than 650 drones in regular operation around the country by the middle of next year. Moving beyond catastrophes, we are very pleased with the underlying performance of our businesses. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio of 96.4 was solid, particularly in light of a high level of non-cat fire related losses. To a large degree we believe it was normal period to period volatility. Bond & Specialty Insurance produced another impressive quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 77.7. In Personal Insurance, the underlying results reflect loss trends within expectations, the continued success of the pricing and underwriting actions we began implementing in our auto business a year ago and the successful performance of our Property business. Notably, our consolidated expense ratio has improved 90 basis points year-to-date. The result is maintaining expense discipline, while investing strategically. For example, in Personal Insurance, over the last few years we've invested in product and marketing initiatives, platform improvements and distribution management, resulting in significant net written premium growth. In Business Insurance, we're investing in technology and enhancing work flow to be a better partner for our agents and brokers, deliver compelling value for our customers and improve our operating efficiency. We've made those investments on about flat G&A expense dollars. We're looking forward to sharing more about these initiatives with you at our Investor Day next month. Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace strategies, which resulted in 4% net written premium growth to a record $6.7 billion. Across our commercial businesses, we continue to be successful in achieving historically high retention rates, positive renewal premium change and an increase in new business. In business units accounting for around two-thirds of our business insurance premium, pure rate change in the quarter was higher both year-over-year and sequentially. In our personal auto business, our execution was spot on plan and we were again pleased to see continued momentum in our industry-leading homeowners business. There's been no lack of speculation around the outlook for pricing in the wake of an unprecedented hurricane season which still has six weeks to go and in the midst of an ongoing unprecedented wildfire season in California. Big events impact pricing when a material amount of industry surpluses eroded and/or when the events change the markets view of risk. It's not hard to make the argument that we've experienced both. By some estimates 10% or more of industry surplus and counting. The first time more than 1 Category 4 hurricane has made landfall on the U.S. mainland in one season. As devastating as it was, a very close call with Irma, and in the fourth quarter, forest fires that are burning not in forests but in subdivisions, and that's not to mention two earthquakes in Mexico and a cyber event impacting more than 140 million U.S. consumers. And while those events have understandably captured everyone's attention that's only part of the story. Interest rates remain at historically low levels. Loss trend has outpaced rate and exposure for a few years now to a degree that many others in the industry are probably not earning their cost of capital. And insured losses from PCS cat events in each of the last four quarters have exceeded the 10 year average for that quarter. I can't predict what the market is going to do, but I will share with you what we're planning to do. As a component of our strategy to manage all the levers available to us to meet our return objectives, for more than a year now we've been discussing our efforts to improve renewal rate change and for more than a year now we've been making incremental but steady progress. The circumstances I've just described strengthen our resolve. We'll seek rate thoughtfully and in close coordination with our distribution partners and in that regard we believe our customers are well served by a stable and predictable market that keeps pace with inflation, as opposed to the higher pricing swings of the past. Two final comments before I pass the microphone to Jay. First, I want to add my voice in support of the corporate tax reform efforts in Washington. As a country, addressing the corporate tax rate is important for enabling U.S. businesses to compete more effectively at home and abroad against our foreign counterparts. Beyond just the tax rate, we were particularly pleased to see that the big six framework for tax reform promotes levelling the playing field between U.S. and foreign companies. In addition to contributing to the country's tax base, it's important in addressing the decades-long streak of U.S. based Companies losing U.S. market share and American jobs to offshore companies. Case in point, a $2.5 billion transaction announced just yesterday. Finally I'd like to thank our claim organization for an extraordinary effort over these past few months. They've certainly risen to the occasion. It's an understatement to say that events like Harvey, Irma, and Maria and others that have been in the news are devastating and our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been impacted. Events like those serve as reminders that in the end we sell a promise. We work hard to make sure that our agents and brokers are proud to sell that promise and that at every opportunity we demonstrate the value of that promise to our customers who buy it. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Alan. Core income was $253 million down from $701 million in the prior-year quarter and core ROE was 4.5% down from 12.5%. As in the first half of the year, these reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by fundamental changes in our underlying performance, rather they were reflective of the high level of cat activity this quarter. Beginning with underwriting results, our underlying underwriting gain remained strong, as evidenced by our 92.8% underlying combined ratio which was 0.7 points higher than the prior-year quarter. This slight increase was primarily due to a relatively high level of non-cat fire related losses in Business Insurance this quarter. Catastrophe losses were $455 million after-tax compared to only $58 million in the prior-year quarter. This increase of $397 million was driven by estimated losses from Hurricane Harvey of $319 million pre-tax or $207 million after-tax. Hurricane Irma of $242 million pre-tax or $157 million after-tax, and Hurricane Maria of $82 million pre-tax or $54 million after-tax. Net favourable prior-year reserve development which I'll discuss in more detail shortly was $10 million after-tax down from $27 million in the prior-year quarter. Net investment income of $457 million after-tax continued to be strong, although down $15 million from the prior-year quarter. Fixed income NII as anticipated was lower by $20 million after-tax due to the continued low interest rate environment, while non-fixed income NII increased by $5 million after-tax due to the strong private equity returns. Interestingly, when we look at the long-term bonds we hold that are maturing through the end of next year, along with growth in the size of our fixed income portfolio and higher short term interest rates, our outlook for after-tax fixed income NII during the remainder of 2017 and into 2018 is only slightly lower, $10 million or less quarter-over-quarter, as compared to the corresponding quarters in 2016 and 2017, an improvement from what we've been experiencing in recent years. Consolidated net favourable prior-year reserve development was $15 million pre-tax compared to $39 million in the prior-year quarter. Business Insurances net favourable reserve development was $9 million pre-tax compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter, including an increase to asbestos reserves of $225 million pre-tax, the same amount as in the prior year quarter. Excluding the asbestos reserve increase, BI\u2019s net favourable reserve development was $234 million pre-tax, primarily driven by better-than-expected loss experience in domestic workers comp and GL, partially offset by higher-than-expected loss experience in domestic commercial auto. As has been the case in recent years, the asbestos reserve increase which related to a broad number of policyholders was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense costs for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods, as compared to our expectation that the environment would improve. As you may recall, the current asbestos environment, which has continued to result in periodic reserve strengthening for us and the industry is still much improved from the high severity environment of 10 to 15 years ago when risks from pre packaged bankruptcies, direct actions filed against insurers, and products, non-products coverage litigation among others led to very expensive settlement activity and a high degree of uncertainty in terns of the outlook. The asbestos environment and more recent years has been frequency driven, the result of people developing mesothelioma and unfortunately dying soon thereafter. Interestingly the most recent data from the Center for Disease Control which we've included on Page 19 of the webcast shows deaths from mesothelioma in 2015 the most recent data available was 7.5% lower than in 2014, and importantly, the age distribution of these deaths has shifted towards higher age groups, possibly due to more people who work with asbestos prior to the mid to late 70s, the high usage years, \"living into the disease.\" What that means is that recent medical advances that have successfully treated a variety of other deadly diseases seem to have enabled more people in this highly exposed cohort to live well into their 70s and 80s and then develop and die from mesothelioma. As nature takes its course this high risk cohort will get smaller over time and accordingly we continue to expect the currently high frequency claim environment to improve over time. Bond & Specialties net favourable development was $6 million pre-tax compared to $46 million in the prior-year quarter, while Personal Insurance had no reserve development compared to $11 million of unfavourable development in the prior-year quarter. Excluding A&E, year-to-date on a combined stat schedule P-basis for all of our subsidiaries all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate developed favourably and other than some modest reserve strengthening for commercial auto, all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favourably or had de minimis unfavourable development. Operating cash flows of over $1.6 billion was very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $2 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the beginning of the year. This higher than normal level of holding company liquidity provides funding for our $450 million of senior notes that mature in December. All of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, net unrealized gains were $1.5 billion pre-tax or a $1 billion after-tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $86.73 and adjusted book value per share of $83.06 increased over 4% and 3% respectively from the beginning of the year. Despite the high level of cat losses, we returned $528 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $200 million and share repurchases of $328 million bringing total capital return to shareholders to $1.68 billion year-to-date. As we've stated for many years and repeated in this quarters 10-Q, the timing and actual number of shares we will purchase in the future will depend on earnings among a variety of other factors, so consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we're keeping our eyes on the California wildfires, which we expect will be a significant cat for us as we evaluate share repurchase activity for the fourth quarter. With that let me turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter's results in Business Insurance, segment income of $105 million and the combined ratio of 109.8% were both impacted by the significant catastrophe events in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 96.4% was 2.3 points higher than the third quarter of 2016 with the underlying loss ratio increasing 3.4 points. The quarterly loss ratio was impacted by an unusually high number of large non-cat property, primarily fire losses and so the year-to-date results are better indication of how the business is performing. On the year-to-date basis the underlying loss ratio is up 1.7 points, 70 basis points of which is due to the large loss volatility I just mentioned, with the remaining about a point driven by loss trend in excessive earned pricing. For the quarter, the underlying expense ratio decreased 1.1 points year-over-year. As with the loss ratio, there are normal fluctuations impacting the quarterly comparison. The year-to-date decline of about a 0.5 is a better indication of our current run rate with the decline driven by both growing earned premium and slightly lower G&A expense dollars. Net written premiums of $3.4 billion for the quarter were up more than a point year-over-year with domestic net written premiums up about 2% driven by strong production results in middle market. International net written premiums were down 3% driven by reinsurance reinstatement premiums related to the cats that occurred in the quarter. Excluding the impact of reinstatement international was up 1%. Turning to domestic production. We were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at a historically high level. Renewal premium change was strong at about three points in the quarter with rate change that was up slightly from last quarter and up a half a point from a year ago. New business of $434 million was up 6% versus the prior-year. Looking at the individual businesses, I'll begin with Select, where production statistics remained strong, with retention for the quarter of 83%, renewal premium change was nearly five points, while new business premiums of $98 million were up 4% year-over-year. In middle market our results reflect consistent performance in the marketplace as demonstrated by another quarter of strong retention at 87%. Renewal premium change of three points was down slightly from the second quarter due to lower exposure growth, while rate increases of nearly a point were up year-on-year and in line with the second quarter. New business of $267 million was up 12% versus the prior-year quarter. We attribute a large portion of this to great execution in the market by our field organization, particularly as it relates to larger accounts in industry segments that we like. We're also encouraged by how our investments in technology are enabling our underwriters to be more active in the market, we'll talk more about that at our upcoming Investor Day. So all-in quarter that was significantly impacted by the weather and we were pleased with our execution in the marketplace. Our fundamental marketplace strategy remains unchanged. We seek to retain our best performing business, while thoughtfully managing the profitability of the book. Importantly, the market and environmental circumstances that Alan outlined earlier further support our ability to successfully execute on this strategy. I'll now turn to Bond & Specialty insurance where segment income for the quarter was strong at $136 million though down somewhat from the prior year quarter due to a lower level of net favourable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio improved nearly a point from the prior year quarter to under 78%. As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 2% reflecting growth in both our domestic management liability and international businesses, with the international growth driven by strong production in both our Canadian surety and UK management liability businesses. Turning to production in our domestic management liability businesses, we  continue to execute our strategy of growing our profitable portfolio by retaining our best performing accounts and writing new business in return adequate product segments. So we couldn't be more pleased that retention came in at a record high of 89% for the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of 88% or better, while new business was up slightly from the third quarter of last year. Renewal premium change of 3.5 points was up slightly from the second quarter due to a modest increase in exposure growth. So Bond & Specialty results remain terrific and we continue to feel great about the segments performance and our market positions. Turning to Personal Insurance. Net written premiums for the segment grew 9% in the quarter with more than half of that growth coming from higher pricing. Despite 8.7 points of catastrophe losses in the quarter, Personal Insurance generated $77 million of segment income with a third quarter combined ratio of 99.7%. The underlying combined ratio of 91% improved about 1.5 point\u2019s year-over-year. The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 106% and included 7.2 points of cat losses, far above our normal third quarter auto cat load expectation of about a 0.5. Compared to the third quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio is down 2.3 points. As you can see on page 15 of the webcast, 1.3 points of the decrease is due to continued improvement in the expense ratio, as we leverage a consistent level of operating expenses over a larger premium base. The remaining point of decrease is primarily due to the fact that the third quarter of 2016 loss ratio included the year-to-date impact of the bodily injury severity reestimation. As we discussed in previous calls, in response to higher bodily injury loss levels, we are taking actions to improve profitability, most notably by improving the pricing of the book. As a result, renewal premium change increased from 7.9% in the second quarter to 9.5% in the third quarter reaching 10.5% for the month of September. We expect that renewal premium change will remain in double-digits for the fourth quarter and as we told you previously, by year-end we will have obtained enough rate on a written basis to address the elevated bodily injury loss levels. Retention declined modestly in the quarter as expected, but remained strong by historical standards even as we implement meaningful price increases through the book. This growth has decelerated but remain positive driven by lower levels of new business. Importantly, we remain on track to achieving the goals we laid out for the auto book back in January. Turning to agency homeowners and other, the combined ratio of 90.3% for the quarter reflects 12.2 points of cat losses. The underlying combined ratio of 78.1% was in line with the quarter, third quarter of 2016, as net trend was offset by the impact of volume on the expense ratio. Homeowners net written premiums increased 5% in the quarter, somewhat accelerating the momentum we had experienced in recent quarters. As a reminder, we have made a concerted effort to generate growth in this profitable line even as we moderate the growth in auto. Process and technology improvements have made it easier for agents and brokers to do business with us and we have focused on adding more property oriented distribution partners and increasing our average number of policies per customer. Overall in Personal Insurance, setting aside the significant impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter, both the agency auto and homeowners results were in line with our expectations and both lines continued to make good progress towards the goals we laid out at the end of last year. So stepping back and looking across the franchise, while the headline for the quarter is obviously the cats, we feel very good about our underlying results. Considering our significant competitive advantages, the investments that we're making to extend them and to develop additional advantages and our ability to execute, we believe each of our businesses is positioned for continued success. With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. We're now ready to open it up to Q&A and if I can ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nKai Pan: Thank you, and good morning. My first question is on the outlook for the core combined ratio for the Business Insurance segments. In your 10-Q, you said broadly consistent into 2018. Could you add like what pass through as sort of component of it in terms of your sort of loss \u2013 core loss ratio deterioration and also potential normalization of non-cat losses, as well as the improvements in expense ratio and does your forecast including like a probably better pricing outlook?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, Kai. Good morning, it's Alan. Thanks for the question. Let me start with it. We're going to try not to in the outlook try to break this down between the components of loss and expense. We give you a sense as best we can looking at our crystal ball which is never perfect and the world is never going to turn out exactly as we thought, but we try to give you as good a sense as we can on the overall profitability by segment. In terms of the rate in particular, you can see the written rate that we've been getting and obviously you can see for example, in BI, quarter-over-quarter, and so that will of course earn in and that will be a component of what gets reflected in our outlook, as will the impact of the expense ratio that you see in the nine months, but we're going to try not to break it down between the loss and expense ratio component.\nKai Pan: Okay. My follow-up question on reserves, there are actually two components to that, one is on asbestos, you've been taking charge of about $200 million a year for many years that we know and so why don't you take a big charge upfront or are you considering reinsurance transaction? The commercial auto site was driven that and is that - like has that - do you pick up that like increase your like current year, accident year loss pick on the commercial auto line as well? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, let me start with the auto side and then I'll ask Jay Benet to comment on the reserves. On the auto, we've been seeing and talking about some severity on the commercial auto side for some time and we've been addressing it. We view this as a tweak to those reserves in prior year periods and you know, think about it's $40 billion reserve increase on a couple of $2 billion or $3 billion reserve base, $2 billion or $3 billion reserve base. So we look at that and we don't over react to it. It's just the normal process of every quarter we go through and we look at our reserves and look at the trends and the cases we've got out there and true it up. So it's not anything that has to any significant degree impacted our view of loss trend or what's happening in the current year period. Jay, do you want to address the asbestos?\nJay Benet: Yes, thanks. As it relates to the asbestos like every other reserve we take our best shot looking at all of the data we have available at points in time to evaluate what the reserve should be, and as part of that, we're making assumptions as to what the future looks like with regard to the level of activity that it will take place in terms of meso deaths and also look at what kind of settlement costs or litigation costs we face, and come up with as I said our best estimate, and what's been taking place over the last several years, as we said in our description of the environment is the environment really hasn't changed very much, but the assumptions we've made that possibly would lead to a fall off in the amount of activity just haven't borne out. So there\u2019s nothing about our reserve increase that reflects a dramatically changing environment and we thought we\u2019d add some color to it this quarter with regard to this page we added to the webcast as it relates to what's been taking place in the various cohorts associated with mesothelioma deaths and we'll see what happens in the future. But as it relates to making any change in process or whatever we didn't think that was appropriate.\nAlan Schnitzer: And Kai, as it relates to the reinsurance you asked that as well. We certainly try to evaluate as best we can from the outside every deal we see announced by others and we are talking to the same people that are on the other side of those transactions evaluating them for us. So no lack of analysis on our end or looking into it. If we found a deal that we thought really made a difference from an economic perspective we would certainly be interested that. We certainly see transactions that provide some limited duration benefit in terms of the GAAP accounting, but when we look at it from an economic basis and get down to the cash flows, we just haven't seen one yet that makes sense for us.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb: Thanks and good morning. I was hoping to touch base on the Business Insurance outlook for commercial insurance pricing. Alan, I believe in your commentary, you talked about seeking thoughtful rate increases in conjunction with your distribution partners, and keeping pricing ahead of loss cost inflation. Given all of the factors that we've seen driving up large losses in the current quarter and into 4Q, can you talk a little bit more in terms of the outlook there?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. We've been saying for some time Jay that for over a year now as we look at our book and we look down the road out at the horizon that we're going to need to improve written rate to meet our return objectives as part of our overall strategy and we've been doing that for some time and you can see we've had some incremental but steady success in it. And when we look at the factors, when we look at the weather we had in the third quarter, when we look at some of the other things going on in the world, that's what's captured everyone's attention. I actually don't think that's the bigger part of the story. I think the bigger part of the story are the underlying dynamics that are driving the overall margins and profitability in this business. And when we look at that and we look at the accounts that we have, we say that it's time to move a little bit. We're not executing towards a headline number. You take all our accounts and we take all our accounts and we segment them very thoughtfully and for some time we've been getting rate in excessive loss trend on the accounts that are most returned challenge for us and we're getting to a point where our need to get rate is sort of extending up the continuum and that's reflected in the fact that this quarter we got rate on the higher percentage of our accounts than we did last quarter and the quarter before that et cetera, et cetera and its been our intention to lead into that. And the events of this quarter and the overall circumstances that I've described caused us to say that we're going to lien into it a little bit more and we feel a little bit more confident in our ability to achieve it.\nJay Gelb: Makes sense. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on personal auto. The underlying combined ratio for auto was \u2013 it was improved to around a 99% and I believe last quarter, the company was talking about kind of a longer term target of 96% to 98% plus some 10 year impact. Clearly, you're getting closer there. How soon before you think we can get into the range?\nMichael Klein: Hey, Jay. This is Michael Klein from Personal Insurance. Thanks for the question. And first, thanks for noticing that the underlying combined ratio was below a hundred and actually improved year-on-year. That's actually the first time in a while that that's been the case. Brian gave the main drivers of the quarter-over-quarter change. I think to your question, you know what's the longer term outlook, we think really, there are two or three really key questions there. One is when are we in terms of pricing, where are we in terms of pricing for the increased bodily injury loss estimates that we recognized in the back half of last year. The second is 10 year playing out the way we anticipated and the third really is you know, at the core of your question what's our outlook for personal auto profitability and I'll just take those three real quickly in turn. Brian did mention we'll have achieved enough rate on our written basis by the end of 2017 to cover the increased level of bodily injury losses. That's on a written basis, so on an earned basis we remain on track to have done that by the end of \u201818 which is consistent with that 18 to 24 month timeframe that we laid out at the beginning of the year. With respect to 10 year, just a couple comments. One, it's important to note that the reason we spiked that out initially was that it had an outsized impact on these kind of period to period comparisons due to the elevated levels of new business that we were writing. As we've talked about the impact of 10 year from one period to the next, the delta that it drives dissipates as new business levels return to normal and as the portfolio matures, which is what's begun to happen in 2017. So from this point forward, 10 year becomes less of an anomaly quarter-over-quarter and just one of many factors that you need to think about as you look at our results. I think what's most important to takeaway this quarter as respect to personal auto as we have begun to turn the corner on profitability. Earned rate is exceeding loss trend and it's combining with underwriting and process changes, growth and expense ratio reduction to drive that improving underlying profitability that you see. As noted in our outlook, we expect underlying profitability and agency auto to improve over the next four quarters relative to the comparable prior periods. I would remind you given we're going into the fourth quarter that fourth quarter is a relatively high combined ratio period from a seasonality perspective, so you've got to sort of factor that into your overall evaluations. But at the end of the day, we feel good about the progress we're making towards our target combined ratio and that progress will continue through 2018 and into 2019.\nJay Gelb: Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Please proceed.\nRandy Binner: Hi, good morning. Thanks. I had a question on the cat losses coming in quite a bit lower particularly with Harvey kind of coming in below the previously guided range. What changed there so dramatically? Did it have to deal with the number of total vehicles or your ability to close claims as you commented earlier in the call? Just trying to get a sense of kind of what improved and how settled the claim activity there is on Harvey and the other hurricanes?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, Randy, it's Alan. I'll start and maybe Jay will have something to add, but the only reason that we gave a view on Harvey is because we were speaking at a conference that wasn't FD compliance and we wanted to talk about it at that conference and so we made a disclosure about it. That was relatively near to the event and so there was a relatively higher degree of uncertainty around our losses at that point, and so the range we gave reflected what we thought and all the information and uncertainty we had at the time, and we've had a significant amount of time elapse from then to now. We've had the opportunity to inspect virtually all of our claims and as I said, the vast majority of our property claims are closed. Not that there's no uncertainty left, but we feel much better from a certainty perspective and are confident in the number we put up. So I would really say nothing dramatically changed. It was the passage of time that gave us more insight into the losses.\nRandy Binner: Well, given that comfort, and would buyback be able to resume maybe earlier than would have been the case if there was more demand surge or other aspects making the tail longer on the claims?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, you know, we - in terms of the storms in the third quarter, we ended the third quarter with our balance sheet in very strong shape, so there's nothing from the third quarter where we feel like we've got to build back a capital deficit to any degree at all. So the fourth quarter will be business as usual in the sense that we'll look at what our earnings are expected to be and we'll consider buybacks accordingly. As Jay said in his prepared remarks, the wildfires are out there. That's an ongoing event that will be significant for us and so we'll evaluate that in our fourth quarter outlook for earnings as we make decisions about buybacks.\nRandy Binner: Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks, good morning, I just had a couple I think for Brian. I guess the first one is if you were to just look at accounts where there were Q3 property losses on the Business Insurance side or maybe those that didn't even have losses but were in loss affected geographies, what's been the conversation I guess so far about with renewals? What's been the magnitude of rate increases or how those conversations have gone? Thanks.\nJay Benet: You know, so and I missed a little bit of the beginning. You said accounts of 32- 3Q, I am sorry, yeah. So, I think it's - some of the stuff is obvious. In the really cat-exposed areas, the conversations are very clear. The perspective on the flood risk, the exposure to the wind, we were reminded once again of what those are, so there's more momentum there. But I think that it's more what Alan said in his opening. The overall environment of what we've been seeing in property. Two or three years ago we were saying that the line was in very healthy condition and although experiencing some price decreases.  The largest price decreases we were seeing in the book a couple years ago we thought it was a healthy line and we would manage it. A couple years later that compounding has impacted the core profitability. So we're looking at that. We're also seeing a little bit of inflation running through the book of business and that is you know in the labor and material side, a number that wouldn't even be big enough to warrant a comment other than the fact that we're beginning to see the line is already under some pressure and the potential for demand surge out of all of the cat activity is making that more dramatic. So a bunch of stuff going on in the line today and we think there's an opportunity to improve the profitability there.\nRyan Tunis: Okay, I guess my follow-up was just thinking about just the potential for further favourable or unfavourable developments in these events. I notice in the Q that the commercial property IBNR looked like it as up about $300 mill quarter-over-quarter. I guess just as you think about the losses you've reported where do you see the I guess, the greatest potential for uncertainty from here on out? Thanks.\nJay Benet: Any time you have large cats, you're settling claims quickly, but generally, those claims that you're settling are more straightforward ones. So when you look at the level of IBNR, that remains a great deal of uncertainty associated with the cat losses. So you know, we'll take - we've taken our best shot based on all of the information that we have available and we can't predict whether that will actually be higher or lower than what this will ultimately come out to be. I think we have a good track record of being fairly good at these estimates, but there is a lot of IBNR at this point in time.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you for the answers.\nJay Benet: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks and good morning. Two questions if I might. The first question goes back to the discussion on pricing. If I were to take that comment and sort of flip it towards the reinsurance side, how do you expect those discussions with their re-insurers to go? Do you expect to sort of hold the line on pricing based on your outlook or just maybe help us understand that equation a bit better?\nAlan Schnitzer: Amit, I don't think we've got a lot of insight to give you on that. Obviously, we'll be thinking about it over the coming weeks and months, and I guess one reason we're not particularly preoccupied by this, we don't buy all that much reinsurance. We're gross line underwriter. We like our underwriting and so we don't buy that much. So on a relative basis we're less impacted by that. I would hope that our thoughtful underwriting as it was demonstrated in these storms would factor into whatever pricing we negotiate when it comes up, but it's just not something we spend a lot of time running our hands over.\nAmit Kumar: Got it. That's a fair comment. Switching back to the discussion on Business Insurance. If you look at the mix of BI, 50% of the book is comp international and GL. Do you think these cat losses give you an ability to enforce some incremental rate action in the non-cat impacted lines or do you think that this somewhat gets relegated to the exposed line set at this juncture?\nAlan Schnitzer: You know, Amit, you've got commercial auto on one end of the spectrum, you've got workers comp on the other end of the spectrum and everything else sort of falls in the middle in terms of where it is in terms of rate adequacy. But what I would tell you though and one of the reasons why in my prepared remarks I was so deliberate about talking not just about the storms that is captured everyone's attention, but about the other underlying factors in the business is those are real. Things like where interest rates are, things like what weather has done, we've got pricing and loss trend over several years that that impacts all the lines. So we view the - our pricing objectives I should say go beyond the property line, really extend across all our lines and all our geographies. So we're not thinking of this as property-related or coastal related. We're thinking about it much more broadly.\nAmit Kumar: Fair point. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question, I'm just trying to get a feel as we think about flood risk here, obviously a big component of the Harvey loss. How much of flood-related risk came through your commercial lines exposure and as you think about going forward is there an opportunity both on the commercial line side and then also maybe depending upon what happens with the national flood program to potentially write more flood risk both within your commercial and personal lines businesses?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, Elyse it's Alan, I'll start and see if Brian has anything to add, but Harvey was by and large a flooding event for us and as it turns out, our underwriting held up and we feel good about it. It's not, you know, we have a pretty good market share in the State and our losses we think are reflected of the fact that we do have proprietary address by address flood underwriting that really stood up to it and so we feel good about it. Whether there's incremental opportunity, you know, after every one of these big events we take a step back and we think about how we feel about our exposures and how we feel about opportunity and what the lessons learned are from that event and how we apply those to exposure elsewhere. So we will be going through a post-mortem process and assessing how we feel about our coastal flood exposure and we may look at that and say, boy we could take on a little bit more. We may look at it and say we're just right or we may look at it and say we would like a little bit less and we're in that process, but it could be we find more opportunity there. On the personal line side, I think that's a much more complicated question and you get into the NFIP. It's really hard to compete with the government program that prices at the discount that it does and as long as there's that program out there, pricing at the discounts at actuarially sound rates, you know, it's not going to be an opportunity for us or anybody.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question, earlier on the call you guys did mention that the California fires would be a significant loss. How do we think through the losses there and the potential business interruption claims from some of the wineries that are obviously very significantly impacted from this event? Any color you can just give there? Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, we're as interested in it as you are. I would say it's early. The event is ongoing, and it's hard for us to give a sense right now, so I'm not sure what else to add there.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJay Cohen: Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick follow-up. The elevated fire losses and the Business Insurance segment, can you talk about or quantify what the impact was in the quarter on the loss ratio?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, in the quarter, Jay, think around two points.\nJay Cohen: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Maybe a tic higher, but two, two and a half something like that.\nJay Cohen: Got it. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nSarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning. Just following up on the pricing discussion. When you talk about pushing prices to keep pace with loss trends, should we interpret that as Business Insurance renewal rates should move closer to about 2% versus the 1% right now?\nJay Benet: Yeah, you know, well first good morning, Sarah. Thanks for the question. I think that's a broader brush than we think about it. I think what you should takeaway is more than the one you see now. We talk about loss trend being for and we\u2019d like to get to a point where we've got rate and the component of exposure that behaves like rate offsetting inflation and maybe even improving from there. So - but the other thing I would tell you is we're intent on doing this in a way that is thoughtful and controlled and close partnership with our agents and brokers and doing it in a way that isn't disruptive to our customers and we think that's actually a much better model for them. So this isn't anything we need to achieve tomorrow or next week or all one fell swoop next quarter. This is going to be a gradual process over time.\nSarah DeWitt: Sure, great. That makes sense. And then just when you say the loss trend being four, is that what you're actually realizing right now or is that what you're booking your reserves at looking at a longer term trend, but I thought maybe more recently its been coming in lower than that?\nJay Benet: Yeah, the four is a broad number and it covers our whole Business Insurance premium base. So obviously, there's variation among the products and businesses within that, and the fact that we've had as much PYD as we've had over recent years suggests that it's come in lower than that. We don't, in terms of our pricing, expect that that's going to continue forever. We expect that over time loss trend is going to return to a longer term average and so our longer term outlook continues to be four.\nSarah DeWitt: Okay, great.\nJay Benet: But that's a very broad observation.\nSarah DeWitt: Sure. Thanks for the answers.\nJay Benet: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please proceed.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. Is there - let me think, how does the fact that people are living into the asbestos-related diseases impact your thinking about permanent injuries on the worker's compensation side?\nAlan Schnitzer: Say that again, Meyer?\nMeyer Shields: Okay. So on the asbestos side one of the factors driving the adverse reserve development is the fact that people are living longer, so asbestos-related diseases are manifesting themselves, there are claims associated with them and I'm wondering if people are living longer how is that impacting worker's compensation reserving?\nBrian MacLean: So this is Brian. I'll take a shot. So obviously, we are factoring into everything we look at in worker's comp and permanent injuries, lifetime injuries into - we're looking at the actuarial life expectancies and given the injuries that the workers have, what is their life span and no question that advances in medicine in general have extended that period over time. So I think it's a lot of the same information is - but that's been embedded in our numbers forever, really. We've always looked at it that way, so I don't think there's anything fundamentally new there.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And then one small question I guess. Within BI, there's a $21 million expense for non-insurance G&A. I was wondering if you could talk through, what's going on there, what that is?\nJay Benet: Yeah, what you're saying, we closed the acquisition of Simply Business this quarter, so what you're going to start seeing is the G&A expense is going to be influenced by what's taking place with regard to their expense base, and from the other side of the coin, the other revenue line is where their revenue numbers are getting consolidated, so that will just work its way through our consolidated results going forward.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Is this a good run rate, the $21 million of expenses?\nJay Benet: Well, we acquired them, we closed on the acquisition in August, so it's not quite a full quarter.\nMeyer Shields: Okay.\nAlan Schnitzer: I'm also not sure that on such a small component that we're necessarily going to give a perspective on a run rate expense versus strategic initiative like that. It's all factored into our outlook and margins for the segment.\nJay Benet: There's also costs associated with the acquisition itself that are flowing through that and so I wouldn't look at it at this point as a run rate, but you can develop it over time. I think ultimately what you'll see is if you look at what's taking place with regard to revenues versus expenses, in total, it's not a big delta.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.\nJay Benet: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi\u2019: And the will be our last question please.\nOperator: Thank you. This question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thank you. First question, I think for Michael. On the personal auto business, is there a way to kind of dissect it where you can give us perspective of how much the improved frequency the industry is seeing that is benefiting you versus what's happening with 10 year and some of the underwriting initiatives that's happening?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Brian. I would say as with respect to the industry trend information, we've seen the second quarter ISOFastTrack data taking a look at it. I would make - I think the same comment we typically make about that data which is it's paid data. It's an interesting data point and certainly not complete, but as we look at the ISOFastTrack data, we look at our own trend experience, you know, we think those results are relatively consistent with what we're seeing. As I mentioned in the earlier questions, sort of dissecting the components, you know, not a lot of change - and I think that I mentioned this, as you think about all of the dimensions underneath the underlying combined ratio there's not really any significant change in any of them this quarter.\nBrian Meredith: Okay, great. And then my second question, just curious you mentioned the cyber loss obviously with Equifax, upfront and there's been some others. Any change in kind of your view of the cyber business here as a result of what's going on, what does the market look like now for cyber? Is that becoming a more attractive growth area at this point?\nMichael Klein: Yes, stepping back I would say that there's an increasing awareness and consciousness in the mind of the risk manager and whether that's a job description for somebody in a big company or proprietor in a small business. I think there's a greater sense of the need for the product and we think that's a healthy thing and we think to a degree that we'll be there to help solve that problem. Having said that, we are extraordinarily mindful that it's an emerging risk and there's a lot about it we know and there's a lot about it we don't know and that gets factored into the way we think about the industries we want to write in, the individual risks we want to write, the lines we put out, the reinsurance programs that we have. And so we do think that it will continue to be a growing opportunity and we will continue to be cautious in the way we approach it.\nBrian Meredith: Great, thank you.\nMichael Klein: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you very much for joining us today, and also we look forward to seeing a number of you at our Investor Day on November 13th. Thank you very much and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you all for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Thank you once again.

And now, Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $595 million and return on equity of 10%. Core income was $543 million and core return on equity was 9.5%. Our results this quarter were impacted by $262 million of after-tax catastrophe losses as well as significant non-cat weather losses, particularly in personal insurance. This has been an active weather year, with first half after-tax catastrophe losses of $488 million or 6 points on the combined ratio. To put that in some context, this was our highest level of first half catastrophe losses since 2011. While relatively high, the level of weather losses this quarter and year are within an over time range that we plan and price for. And we are confident that we are appropriately managing our exposures. Putting aside the weather, we were very pleased with the underwriting results in our commercial businesses and the progress we have made in personal insurance. In business insurance, we improved our underlying combined ratio compared to the prior year quarter. We were able to maintain a flat underlying loss ratio year-over-year in part by managing the non-rate levers that we talked to you about from time-to-time. Things like risk selection, mix, segmentation, risk control and claims handling. We also improved our expense ratio by about half a point. Our Bond & Specialty business delivered another quarter of excellent results with a combined ratio of 68.7%. In personal insurance, the underwriting results in both auto and home for the quarter were significantly impacted by catastrophe and non-cat weather losses. Within personal auto, bodily injury loss trends remained consistent with our expectations and we are on track with the actions we have taken to improve profitability. In terms of our investment results for the quarter, after-tax net investment income increased 6% over the prior year quarter benefiting from strong private equity returns. Our results enabled us to return $676 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $475 million in share repurchases. Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace strategies, which resulted in 5% net written premium growth to a record $6.64 billion. Across our commercial businesses, we continued to be successful in achieving historically high retention levels while also delivering positive and in some cases somewhat higher renewal rate change from recent quarters. In our core middle-market business, we achieved positive renewal rate change on an increasing portion of our portfolio. From a little more than half our accounts in the first quarter of last year to almost 60% in the first quarter of this year to just over 60% in the current quarter. And we did so while simultaneously maintaining retention at a very high 88%. As you have heard us say many times, our production is a result of deliberate account by account and class by class execution. Our efforts this quarter and over recent quarters reflect the continued low interest rate environment and the fact that rate together with the component of exposure that has the same impact on margins as rates have been below loss trend for a few years now. We will continue to execute to meet our return objectives, including by managing the non-rate letters and by seeking rate increases selectively and thoughtfully. In Personal Insurance, we continue to improve the profitability in our auto business by implementing the pricing and underwriting actions that we have discussed with you over the last few quarters. We are on track to achieve double-digit renewal premium change on a written basis for the end of the third quarter and loss trend remains consistent with our expectations. Given that progress and the continued growth in our very profitable Homeowners business, we feel good about the trajectory of our personal lines business. Looking forward across all our businesses, we are engaged strategically to maintain and strengthen our competitive advantages. We are focused on our digital agenda on advancing the way we leverage data on exploring and piloting smart investments and things like AI and robotics on setting the standard in terms of the experience for our customers and distribution partners and as always on being as productive and efficient as possible. So as much as we are relentlessly committed to day-to-day execution we are just as committed to our long-term strategic position. And speaking of our digital agenda, we couldn\u2019t be more excited to welcome Simply Business under the Travelers\u2019 umbrella in the third quarter. To sum it up, I am pleased and encouraged by execution in the first half of the year. And with our franchise value, strong balance sheet, superior talent and capital management strategy, we remain well-positioned to continue to deliver industry leading results. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Alan. Core income was $543 million down from $649 million in the prior year quarter. And core ROE was 9.5%, down from 11.6%. As was the case in the first quarter, these reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by fundamental changes in our performance rather they were reflective of lower net favorable prior year reserve development and another quarter of relatively high levels of cat and non-cat weather activity. Beginning with underwriting results, net favorable prior year reserve development, which I will discuss in more detail shortly, was $132 million after-tax or $60 million less than the prior year quarter. This decrease was almost entirely in bond and specialty, where net favorable development decreased from a very high amount in the prior year quarter. Cat losses were $262 million after-tax, $40 million higher than the already high $222 million in the prior year quarter. And while remaining strong as evidenced by our 93.5% underlying combined ratio, underlying underwriting gain was lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to two things. As we had anticipated, the timing impact of personal auto bodily injury loss estimates that were consistent with the higher loss trends that we recognized in the second half of 2016 and normal quarterly fluctuations in non-cat weather. Investment results were once again strong, net investment income of $468 million after-tax, increased by 6% or $26 million as compared to the prior year quarter. Non-fixed income, NII increased by $46 million after-tax due to strong private equity returns, which more than offset the fully anticipated $20 million after-tax decrease in fixed income NII driven by the continued low interest rate environment. Consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development was $203 million pre-tax compared to $288 million in the prior year quarter. Business Insurance\u2019s net favorable reserve development was $125 million pre-tax, the same as in the prior year quarter and net of the $65 million pre-tax or $42 million after-tax increase to environmental reserves. BI\u2019s favorable development was driven by better than expected loss experience in our domestic businesses for workers\u2019 comp, CMP liability, NGL. Bond & Specialty\u2019s net favorable development was $78 million pre-tax, down from a very high $159 million in the prior year quarter, driven by better than expected loss experience in our domestic management liability business and it was known that prior year reserve development in PI this quarter. On a combined statutory Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate develop favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development in the first half of the year. Operating cash flows of $810 million remain very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $2.6 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the beginning of the year and higher than what we considered to be normal. This $900 million increase driven mostly by the $700 million, up 4% 30-year senior notes that we issued on May 30 allows for the funding of our acquisition of Simply Business expected to close in the third quarter as well as the repayment of our $450 million of senior notes maturing in December. All of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax or $1 billion after-tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $86.46 and adjusted book value per share of $82.71 increased 4% and 3% respectively from the beginning of the year. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses allowing us to return $676 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $201 million and repurchased $475 million of our common shares consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. And year-to-date we returned $1.15 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the mic over to Brian, there is one additional topic I will cover. On Page 19 of the webcast, you can see an update of our cat reinsurance treaties that renewed on July 1. There were no significant changes to these treaties and their cost was modestly lower than last year. As for our one remaining cat bond, which runs through May 2018 it\u2019s attachment point maximum limit were reset as required annually to adjust the modeled expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. For the year beginning May 16, 2017, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond if losses in the covered area for single occurrence reach an initial attachment point of $2.346 billion, up from the previous attachment point of $1.968 billion. The full $300 million of coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum of $2.846 billion. With that, I will turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter\u2019s results in Business Insurance, we are pleased with segment income of $429 million and a combined ratio of 96.5%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.8%, down 0.5 point compared to the second quarter of 2016, driven by a lower expense ratio. The decline in the expense ratio resulted from slightly lower expense dollars and growing earned premium. Turning to the underlying loss ratio, as Alan mentioned earlier, our active management of the non-rate levers along with favorable non-cat weather in Business Insurance contributed to a comparable loss ratio year-over-year. We were especially pleased that we were able to achieve this result in an environment of relatively modest price increases. Net written premiums of $3.5 billion for the quarter were up more than 2% year-over-year, with domestic net written premiums, up about 2% driven by strong production results in select and middle-market. International net written premiums were up 8%, driven by the timing of certain adjustments in the second quarter of 2016. Turning to domestic production, one of our critical objectives is to retain our high-quality book of business. And accordingly, we were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at a historically high level. Renewal premium change was 3.5 points in the quarter, up about 1 point from the first quarter due to exposure growth in all lines, most notably in our property lines. Rate change remained consistent with last quarter and up more than 0.5 point from a year ago. We continue to achieve rate gains selectively and thoughtfully and are pleased that improvement in rate from a year ago has come broadly across the portfolio. New business of $491 million was consistent with the prior year quarter. Looking at the individual businesses, I will begin with Select, where production statistics remain strong, with retention for the quarter of 83%. Renewal premium change was about 5 points while new business premiums of $109 million were up 10% year-over-year. In middle-market, our results reflect consistent performance in the marketplace as demonstrated by another quarter of strong retention at 88%. Renewal premium change of about 3.5 points was up about a point from the first quarter due primarily to increased exposure across all lines and included nearly a point of renewal rate change, up a bit from the first quarter. New business of $294 million was down slightly versus the prior year quarter. So, all-in a good financial result for the segment with continued stability in the marketplace. I will now turn to Bond & Specialty Insurance, where segment income for the quarter was strong at $163 million. Income was down somewhat from the prior year quarter due to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio remained very strong 82%. As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 5% across the segment, with solid growth in our domestic surety and management liability businesses. In international, growth was driven by strong production in our Canadian Surety and UK Management Liability businesses, along with some non-recurring policy and reinsurance timing. Turning to production in our domestic management liability business, we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best performing accounts, while writing new business in return adequate product segments. So, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that for the third consecutive quarter, retention came in at a historic high of 88%, while new business was up slightly from the second quarter of last year. Renewal premium change of 3.8 points was down slightly from the first quarter. So, Bond & Specialty results remained terrific and we continue to feel great about the segment\u2019s performance and our market positions. Turning to Personal Insurance, net written premiums for the segment grew 8% in the quarter, with roughly half of that growth coming from price increases. The quarter\u2019s combined ratio of 104.1 was significantly impacted by weather, with catastrophe losses of nearly 10 points for the second consecutive quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 94.5 was also significantly impacted by weather, with non-catastrophe loss levels that were well above what we would normally expect in the second quarter. Turning to auto, in terms of production, we are pleased that we were successful in maintaining strong retention, while achieving significant price increases. New business was down slightly year-over-year, while TIF growth moderated. The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 106.4 with 4 points of cat losses more than double our normal second quarter expectation. The auto underlying combined ratio of 102.4 was also impacted by weather, with about 1.5 points of non-cat weather losses, which was above our expectations, but about the same as the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of weather, auto loss results remained in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio was up 3.8 points. As you can see on Page 15 of the webcast, the increase is primarily due to the timing of the impact of the higher run-rate of bodily injury losses that we recognized in the second half of 2016. As we discussed in our year end results call, in response to higher bodily injury loss levels we are taking actions to improve profitability, most notably by improving the pricing of the book. Renewal premium change increased from about 6% in the first quarter to nearly 8% in the second quarter and we remain on track to reach double-digit increases before the end of the third quarter. By year end, we expect to have obtained enough rate on a written basis to address the elevated bodily injury loss levels. The full earned impact of these written rate increases will be realized by the end of 2018 consistent with the timeframe we mentioned in January. As we have discussed in recent quarters, the combined ratio also continues to be elevated due to the impact of tenure on our book as the higher levels of new business written in previous periods continue to season. We expect this impact will continue to grow for a few more quarters albeit at a decreasing rate. As new business production moderates to a steady state, the tenure impact will gradually diminish. The gradual reduction of the tenure impact, along with rate that keeps pace with loss trend over time, should result in a combined ratio that aligns with our target. It\u2019s important to note that even though the combined ratio is currently elevated due to the impact of tenure, we expect the new business to add economic value on a lifetime basis as the increased volume brings additional profit dollars. Turning to Agency Homeowners and Other, the combined ratio of 100.3 for the second quarter reflects 17.5 points of cat losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.8 was 4.6 points higher than the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to non-cat weather losses, which were also significantly higher than our long-term average. Continuing the momentum in recent quarters, Homeowners\u2019 net written premiums and policies in-force both grew at levels consistent with the strong results we experienced in the first quarter. We were pleased that we achieved modest price increases in this profitable line, added more property-oriented distribution partners, and focused on account rounding. So clearly, a significant impact from weather in the quarter, but we continued to grow our profitable Homeowners business and made good progress towards the goals we laid out for auto at the end of last year. With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Kelly, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I would ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKai Pan: Thank you and good morning. My first question on Personal Insurance, could you quantify the impact from the non-cat weather as well as a tenure in the second quarter results?\nBrian MacLean: Yes. So, I will start with that. This is Brian. And let me do them in reverse order. On the tenure impact, we said last quarter or the quarter before that it was about 2 points and that\u2019s up about 1 point. So right now, it\u2019s about 3 points in total in the combined ratio and that\u2019s about 1 point delta from last year. On the non-cat weather of the 4.6 points you know variance in the underlying, the vast majority of it and you can think roundly about three quarters of that number is due to non-cat weather. And the reason for the lack of total precision there is that we are looking at a lot of loss activity in trying to attribute it and we were pretty accurate on it, but it\u2019s not something that you can specifically tie down and Michael has got a little bit more detail.\nMichael Klein: Yes. I think so again, the 4.6 Brian is referring to as property year-over-year variance. And as you said, the majority of that is due to non-cat weather. I would say a couple of things on that front. One, from our perspective and I think you can look at weather data and see that it was a very active first half of the year from a weather standpoint. NOAA talked about nearly 11,000 severe weather events through May of this year being up over long-term averages. And I think importantly to back it up to what non-cat weather is right. So, our non-cat weather according to our definition does include some PCS events that don\u2019t meet our catastrophe threshold, but it also includes a variety of much smaller weather events that never make the news. And connecting that to the NOAA data one of the things that they talked about is through May, there were over 6,000 reports of wind damage, which is either wind damage or storms that have significant wind associated with them. Again, not the things that show up on the news, but according to their statistics, those events that 6,000 is almost double the average of the 2000 to 2016 run-rate. And it\u2019s the second highest amount of storms of that type since 2011. So, I think our experience is consistent with that, the drivers underneath that non-cat weather. The biggest incurred loss increases we see underneath that estimate are associated with wind and hail.\nKai Pan: Great.\nAlan Schnitzer: So, that\u2019s a little bit more color on what\u2019s underneath that from a property.\nBrian MacLean: Right. So this is Brian. So, that was a very good long answer to the question you didn\u2019t ask. I apologize for hearing that incorrectly. But on the auto side, there is 1.5 points as I said in the underlying, about 1.5 points of non-cat weather losses, which comparable to what we had in last year\u2019s results and I would say a good bit higher than what we \u2013 what our normal expectations would be, what our long-term averages are. So, hopefully that\u2019s responsive.\nKai Pan: I really appreciate the extensive response. My follow-up questions on expense ratio side, you have seen quite a bit of improvements in Personal Auto, will that continue? And then were you expanding any of these initiatives into the Business Insurance on the expense side, because we have seen some year-over-year improvement there as well? Are there more to come?\nBrian MacLean: Yes. So, let\u2019s take the two pieces. Michael can talk a little bit. Expenses we have done \u2013 we have been doing a lot in Personal Insurance for the last couple of years and that is continuing and then we could talk a little bit about Business Insurance and what we are doing there. So, Michael on the PI\u2026\nMichael Klein: Yes, from a Personal Insurance standpoint, the story continues to be that we are adding volume and holding costs pretty consistent. So, I mean that\u2019s a continuation of the story we have been talking about and we continue to see some of that benefit in the quarter.\nAlan Schnitzer: Hey, Kai, good morning, it\u2019s Alan. Let me try to address your question on Business Insurance. So, we don\u2019t give outlook explicitly on expenses and there is always from period-to-period going to be some ups and downs in expenses. But we have had a number of initiatives underway. We have got initiatives underway now. If you looked at our shop floor right now, we\u2019d say that there is improved productivity. It\u2019s \u2013 you don\u2019t exactly see that coming through in the numbers in the moment, because for example there is other ups and downs and we have got the expenses associated, the cost associated with creating that productivity, but it is a serious and ongoing initiative that we are all hopeful that we will be seeing in incoming periods.\nKai Pan: Great. Well, thanks so much for all the answers.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, yes. My first question is on just in going through some of your commentary in the queue in terms of the outlook for the Business Insurance business for 2018 you point to stable renewal price changes and also stable margins. I guess just how are you expecting your margins to stay stable when even if we get continued exposure growth, your rate is falling below trend, if you could just provide some additional commentary and how you see kind of your margins in that business playing out in 2018?\nAlanSchnitzer: Yes, good morning, Elyse, it\u2019s Alan. Thanks for the question. We do get that from time-to-time. And I think we have addressed that on this call from time-to-time. We get the math here looking at it\u2019s a very certain narrow rate versus loss trend. But what we have told you and what I tried to address in my prepared remarks this morning is that there are plenty of levers other than just pure rate that contribute to the margin outlook. And I mentioned some of it in my prepared remarks, things like segmentation and risk selection and claims handling and risk control expenses, all the rest. So, all of those things wrap up in margin. The component of margin that is sort of narrow rate versus loss trend, particularly when you take into account the component of exposure that behaves like rate from a margin perspective is and continues to be relatively small. And these incremental rate gains that we have been writing for a few quarters now have offset that to some degree. So, you take all that together and we are comfortable with a broadly consistent outlook. Of course there is going to be volatility from things like weather, but in terms of things we control we feel good about a broadly consistent margin outlook, we have been giving you that outlook for some quarters now and we have delivered on it. So, we feel good about it.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then just a couple of quick things on that Personal Auto side, the new business did decline this quarter, policy count still do go up sequentially. How do you see the policy count playing out as you continue to push for more rate? And a second question in the commentary you guys pointed to what you are doing to get back to your target margin in that business. Could you just remind us what your target margin is for the Personal Auto business? Thank you.\nMichael Klein: Sure. And Elyse, this is Michael. I will start with the target margin question. I think broadly a combined ratio range of 96 to 98 points for auto is the range that we are shooting for over time. To your question on TIF and PIF growth, as we have talked about, our strategy is to improve profitability in auto, while growth moderates. We are very pleased with the trajectory that the TIF growth in the new business is on. We are also, I\u2019ll say particularly pleased with the strength of retention in the face of the increased rate. You see retention in the production slide at 85 points, actually above our long run average for that number, a number we are very pleased with as we have moved rate up almost a couple of points quarter-on-quarter. In terms of the outlook for PIF growth again our plan remains consistent. We are looking for moderate growth, while we continue to improve profitability.\nAlan Schnitzer: And Elyse, it\u2019s Alan. I would just add on the margin target. There is some advantage we have to being an account solution, the fact that we have such a good Homeowners\u2019 book enables us to \u2013 gives us some advantage in the combined ratio target for the auto and not from a subsidization perspective, but from a synergy perspective, for example, the impact on retention and things like that. So, we think the fact that we are an account solution provider is a big help from that perspective.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Gelb: Thanks and good morning. With regard to the small commercial business market, Travelers is clearly a leader in that space. We have seen a number of other large companies looking to either enter that business or more insured tech focused operations trying to disrupt that business. Can you talk about how Travelers is defending its position in that profitable market?\nAlanSchnitzer: Yes, good morning Jay, it\u2019s Alan. So, yes, we read the same retrofit you read to one degree or another, occasionally we see it in the marketplace, I think different competitors and others are at different stages of their engagement in the marketplace. And just a couple of things, one, we do have \u2013 start with a great position, we think that\u2019s important from a competitive perspective. We have got great technology. We have got great talent. We have got great data. We have got great relationships with distribution. We think all that\u2019s \u2013 all that\u2019s very important. And we are not standing still. So, some of the investments I mentioned in my prepared remarks are directly related to those businesses. That\u2019s important for us. And you look at investments like Simply Business that is meant to make sure that as we look around the landscape and see how the world is changing that we are positioning Travelers to continue to be effective and very competitive in that marketplace. And lastly, I would have that small commercial, in fact all of our businesses have always been competitive and we have got lots of arrows in the quiver that I guess I should say competitive advantages that enable us to compete effectively. So, we feel good about the outlook.\nJay Gelb: As competition increases in that space and it moves more towards technology focused, I mean, we see a number of these companies saying essentially one or two clicks and you get the quote to bind. Is Travelers where it needs to be from that perspective?\nAlanSchnitzer: Yes. There is a lot of rhetoric out there. How much business is actually being transacted on that basis and how much is aspirational from the perspective whether that you are saying is something that is worth looking into. But I would say that we are as engaged as anybody on \u2013 in all those areas and as aspirational as everybody in all those areas. So, yes, we think we are where we need to be to make sure that we continue to be competitive. And again, just think about the innovation going on around here are the investments that we are making and we are not flat-footed. These aren\u2019t things that we are starting with today, these things that we in many, many cases have been thinking about for many years. And again I will just point to the Simply Business transaction. That\u2019s something that we announced a couple of quarters ago, but it\u2019s nothing we stumbled on a couple of quarters ago. That was the result of having been thinking about the exact issue you are talking about over a number of years and planning and being thoughtful and strategic about it. So I would say yes, we are where we need to be.\nJay Gelb: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nAlanSchnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Cohen: Yes. Just one follow-up, maybe two follow-ups on the personal line side, one is that PIF growth in the Homeowners business seems pretty resilient in the face of rising auto insurance premium rates. Would you expect to maintain that or could your effort to improve auto have some spillover effect on the Homeowners side?\nMichael Klein: Jay, this is Michael. I think that\u2019s something that we have been talking about and focusing on and it is why in addition to our objective to improve profits and moderate growth in auto. Our other key objective is to maintain the momentum in homes. To Brian\u2019s prepared remarks, we have made some specific efforts to sustain that home growth in the face of seeking the auto rate, focusing more on rounded business. The good news underneath both the auto and the home growth is the strongest growth we see it in rounded accounts where we are writing both the auto and the home or writing the auto or the home with other lines of business. We are focusing on property intensive distribution relationships, focusing on distribution management and working with agents and brokers to make sure they are giving us at least our fair share of the property business that goes with the auto we write. So, I think through a series of specific tactics and strategies that\u2019s what helped us sustain the home growth so far and we are hopeful that we can continue that.\nJay Cohen: That\u2019s good answer. Thank you. The other just quick one on the auto side, if you look at second quarter underlying loss ratio versus first quarter that did get a bit worth, I am assuming some of that\u2019s non-cat weather and I am assuming some of that is seasonality. Is that a fair assessment?\nAlan Schnitzer: Jay, tell us again what number you are looking at. Just so I want to make sure that we are looking the right thing.\nJay Cohen: Yes. I am looking at personal auto second quarter underlying loss ratio versus first quarter underlying loss ratio first quarter 2017, so consecutive quarter?\nAlan Schnitzer: As you can see in the webcast, the lion\u2019s share of that is the timing of the recognition of the bodily injury losses and then there is the 10-year component that Brian mentioned.\nJay Benet: But if you are comparing Q2 this year to Q1 this year, Jay?\nJay Cohen: The timing shouldn\u2019t be an issue.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, I am sorry, I was thinking you were talking\u2026.\nJay Benet: Right. So, I think to your point, there is seasonality in that expectation is the key driver of that. Again, when we look at underlying consistent with the comments that Brian made, you do have non-cat weather impacting that. We have a higher loss ratio expectation in the second quarter than we do in the first largely related to weather and driving activity picking up.\nJay Cohen: Got it. Helpful. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Brian, you mentioned when you are discussing to this insurance that there was lower non-cat weather in the quarter, is that just sort of randomness or is there some reason why you would see a divergence in non-cat weather losses between business and personal insurance?\nBrian MacLean: Yes, I think it\u2019s mostly randomness. And when you think of what\u2019s driving the non-cat weather as Michael said, it\u2019s not the big, big catastrophe events, the smaller events are the ones that don\u2019t even make PCS events. And those things are more likely to have a frequency on the Homeowners side than they would on the business insurance side. So, it\u2019s probably mostly randomness and then some the nature of the beast.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. So, Meyer, you think about hail for example and the types of things that individuals ensure are more susceptible to hail damage, for example, than commercial property that\u2019s more resilient.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that makes sense. The second issue when we look at the pricing changes in business insurance that are hovering around 60 basis points, which is appreciably different than the preceding four quarters. I am saying appreciably, so less than a point. Does that translate into sort of different expectations for core underwriting margins? Is it a little easier as that 60 basis points runs in?\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure. I mean, it\u2019s just math right. As the pure rate goes up and by the way I would point out that the exposure is up 2, we are not calling that a trend, but it\u2019s broadly enough across our portfolio that for the most part we are attributing it to economic activity. But you look at that incremental price and you look at the component of exposure that behaves like rates and sure, it\u2019s math that it\u2019s a good guy from a margin perspective for sure. It\u2019s not \u2013 we are not at the point where they are equal to each other, but we are getting closer.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Thanks so much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning. First, just on the personal auto insurance combined ratio target of 96% to 98%, does that include the tenure impact and what I am trying to get at is when you say you get back to your target margins by the end of \u201818 should we be thinking 96% to 98% plus a couple of points for tenure?\nMichael Klein: So, Sarah to your point, let me just make sure I say this accurately. So when we say at the end of \u201818 we are not talking about the tenure. So, it is 96% to 98% plus a tenure impact. So I think it\u2019s the way you just said it. And\u2026\nAlan Schnitzer: And specifically your comment about the end of \u201818 is rates covering the increased bodily injury loss estimate.\nMichael Klein: Right, right. And so I think as you put those things together it answers I think the other way you asked that which is when we say 96% to 98% we are assuming that tenure has moderated and we are at kind of a steady state.\nJay Benet: But I will go back just to highlight Brian included in his prepared remarks which is we don\u2019t look as tenure as a bad guy, because it\u2019s part of the plan. It\u2019s adding economic value. And so that\u2019s deliberate.\nSarah DeWitt: But would it be zero by the end of \u201818 right?\nJay Benet: No, no, no. I think Michael said this in the last quarter comments I just repeat it is that when we talk about the timing of tenure unwinding what we are talking in terms of years, not quarters.\nSarah DeWitt: And then my follow-up is just could you revisit again what you are seeing in terms of lot trends this quarter. Are they consistent? Are there any signs of it picking up or moderating and if you could talk about commercial versus personal? That would be helpful.\nMichael Klein: Yes. I will take that Sarah in our personal business, loss trend came in as we expected. So \u2013 and I think we have told in the past where expectations were, but there is nothing happened this quarter or first half of the year that was inconsistent with our expectations. And I would make the same comment about business insurance it\u2019s very stable and inconsistent with our expectations. Now, I am addressing in a sentence frequency and severity over $15 billion of business. So, there is always going to be ups and downs in one line versus another, but broadly speaking, we view loss trend in our commercial businesses as I am nothing remarkable consistent with expectations.\nSarah DeWitt: Okay, great. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Two questions here. First one, could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing with terms and conditions in the Business Insurance segment, any changes going on is the market getting maybe a little bit more generous in that area?\nAlan Schnitzer: The short answer is no, we are not seeing anything significant. There is obviously always little movements up and down, but nothing dramatic that we are seeing.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes. Again hard to address doing our premium in one sentence, but by and large, there is nothing that we are looking at that\u2019s causing us to think differently about current results or outlook.\nBrian Meredith: Got it. Deductibles are covered. Okay, great. And then a second question just curious if I look at your commercial auto, some premium growth going on there, is that largely rates driven or you are actually seeing opportunities in the commercial auto to pickup business here?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, the short answer \u2013 this is Greg Toczydlowski. The short answer on that one is it\u2019s predominantly rate-driven across the portfolio. Our commercial auto book as we have shared in the past certainly hasn\u2019t been immune to some of the pressures that we are seeing across the entire industry on automobile. And accordingly, we have been pursuing rate on that. So, that\u2019s what you are seeing move through that top line. Because we are so much of an account solution, the retention has been pretty strong and so that gives us that net impact on the top line. So we are going to continue pursuing that strategy.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed your question.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call. I like to revisit that the little tick up we saw in the domestic business insurance from a rate perspective. And to your perspective, could you talk about how much that is you versus maybe the environment if we are assuming maybe a little bit of a tick up and awakening up of competition. We have seen a couple of surveys that suggest maybe sort of flatten your pricing and I just don\u2019t know how much to read into it?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, I would say, it\u2019s definitely both to some degree, right. I mean, it\u2019s us what we transact very deliberately on an account by account and class by class solution, so the rate we are getting is because we are trying to get the rate, but we are getting it because we operate in a very competitive marketplace and if the marketplace weren\u2019t letting as getting, we wouldn\u2019t be getting it. So, we are certainly not given the premium growth we have. So, I would say it\u2019s a combination of both. Now, I do think that we do have some advantages here maybe relative to the market. One, franchise value matters when it comes to pricing. So, product perhaps, relationships with distribution, which is valuable to our customers and our distribution, claims handling, risk control those things, I think really matter when it comes to the value we can deliver. And secondly, I would say we have got really important data and analytics and that helps us from a granular pricing perspective as well. So I would say it\u2019s the combination of the efforts the franchise value and competitive advantage that we have been in the marketplace.\nPaul Newsome: Is there nothing in the competitive environment that you have seen any swings competitors moving it out or vice-versa or it is basically just kind of a general trend?\nAlan Schnitzer: It\u2019s a little soft. Can you repeat that?\nPaul Newsome: Sorry, the soft is voice. Have you seen any actual trends or changes in your competitors themselves, anybody moving in and out or making any changes from a pricing perspective?\nAlan Schnitzer: It\u2019s just \u2013 it would be so hard without taking it through competitor by competitor, business by business, geography by geography to give you a sense of that, but there is always movements, competitor by competitor, business by business, geography versus geography. And so to the extent we see any of that occurring now, it would be consistent with the way we see that type of dynamic over time. So, in that respect, I am not really.\nPaul Newsome: Okay, thanks very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, thank you. A couple of questions on non-cat weather, I guess or maybe one. Allstate has taken the tax of reporting a much lower threshold for what they call catastrophe, but we should assume that of course there is going to be some level of cat activity in every quarter or every time they announced their numbers. When you talk but non-cat weather activity look over your data of the last 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, does that net \u2013 does the benefit and hindrance of non-cat weather net out to zero or is it a negative profit layer on the top of how we should look at things?\nAlan Schnitzer: I am not sure, Josh, what you are asking. I mean, we have an expectation of what non-cat weather is going to do over time in a range and we set our prices in part based on that expectation. So whether it\u2019s a positive or negative over time is going to be a function of over time whether we are getting the right price for the losses. So, I don\u2019t \u2013 if you are asking sort of where it is in a particular period relative to a long-term average, we can give you that information too. But as I have said in my opening remarks, what we are seeing is certainly relatively high. There is no question about it, but not outside of what we would expect in the context of an over time range.\nJosh Shanker: So when you say that three quarters of the personal lines deterioration is due to non-cat weather, that\u2019s non-cat weather above and beyond a layer of normal expectation?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, actually I think the number that you are talking about was a property number, but I think what we are explaining is a year-over-year variance. So, I think that the year-over-year variance, if I am remembering the number right, assuming like 4.6 points at least in home. And I think what Brian\u2019s comment was is that the lion\u2019s share of that is non-cat weather that was worse in the current quarter as compared to non-cat weather in the prior year quarter.\nBrian MacLean: And then I did. So that\u2019s what I meant by the three quarters. I did also say in my comments that it was also significantly higher than our long-term average. So, maybe a little less than that other number whatever it might be, but still significantly higher than our long-term average and within a volatility as Alan said that isn\u2019t totally out of pattern. One of the tricky things with this, Josh, especially when we are talking about Homeowners but also with our commercial property, weather in totality makes up something between 40% and 50% of our total loss content. So, you are at some point you are almost talking about the loss ratio in aggregate, which if you are trying to include every single weather related loss. So it\u2019s\u2026\nJosh Shanker: And just another avenue I guess of discussion, your results in Business Insurance continued to be very, very good regardless of weather the variance from a quarter ago. If you would accept 100 or 200 basis points lower level of profitability in that line of business, could you grow materially? Are you being \u2013 is there an opportunity that\u2019s not being met, because you are being so profitable than maybe you should relax profitably goals and instead grow?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Josh. We have always thought that lowering price to generate incremental premium is a fool\u2019s errand, because we operate in a very competitive marketplace and you just end up with same relative market share at lower profitability. And once you lower the price and consequently lower the margins on the business you are keeping, then you got to write a whole lot of new business to get that margin back. So, we don\u2019t feel like that strategy. We like the strategy of again as I have priced on like a broken record, but on a very granular basis, looking at the accounts and classes of business that we are writing, we look at our loss cost in a yield curve and we calculated price that we think meets our return objective and that\u2019s the way we run the railroad. So, we don\u2019t like the strategy of lowering price to generate volumes.\nJosh Shanker: Okay. Well, good luck and thank you for the answers.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. Thank you. This is what appears to be our last question.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry Greenberg: Good morning and thank you. Just wondering can you give us any color on the environmental strengthening whether the complexion of that was any different than it has been in the past. I know it\u2019s a little bit better than a year ago. Is there anything maybe extrapolate from that related to the third quarter, it\u2019s best to sort of view and are you guys thinking any differently about how you should be managing these exposures?\nJay Benet: Hey, Larry. This is Jay Benet. So, in relation to the environmental charge this year versus what we saw last year you are right it was moderated from the levels of the prior year. It continues to be an area of frustration. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d call at the level of a nuisance at this point in time. We are not talking about very large dollars, but as you know every year we take a crack at what we think is going to happen with regard to new policyholders, what happens with regard to the active policyholders, what\u2019s taking place in relation to defense cost versus actual cleanup cost and we have to make lots of assumptions associated with that. A year goes by or 6 months or whatever the period of time is, we look at what\u2019s actually taking place versus those assumptions. And what we say in the Q is what I am going to repeat here that the favorable trends, we have been seeing for a number of years continue. They didn\u2019t continue quite at the level that we expected, but there was still favorable when it came to policies presenting new claims of policyholders with new claims or what\u2019s taking place with regard to other aspects of it. But as we have refined those estimates in this particular case we came up with an additional increase to the reserves. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of it. I will say that there are parts of the country of the Pacific Northwest in particular, where cleanup costs are being a little more elevated than what we had anticipated. So, you do have certain jurisdictional elements associated with this that will change what your estimates of costs are, but I will go back to what I said before that on the overall context of our reserve levels in Business Insurance in the company as a whole. This is fairly de minimis item at this point in time.\nLarry Greenberg: And nothing defense cost wise to extrapolate to asbestos or anything else?\nJay Benet: No, I don\u2019t think you can really extrapolate what takes place in environmental to asbestos, but I think you can, if you can extrapolate anything, you can probably look at what other companies have said about the same subjects of the asbestos and environmental and recognize that we are no different than everybody else. So, I think we will continue to address each one of these things. We have our claims study ongoing as it relates to asbestos and we have more news to tell about.\nLarry Greenberg: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Excellent. This looks like we are wrapping up. Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, we are available on Investor Relations for any follow-up questions. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 20, 2017. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2017 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chief Executive Officer; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, Chief Operating Officer. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. In addition, other members of senior management are in the room, including Bill Heyman, Chief Investment Officer; Michael Klein, President of Personal Insurance; Tom Kunkel, President of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Greg Toczydlowski, President of Business Insurance. Before I turn it over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the [ explanatory ] notes included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. One final note before I turn it over to Alan, as a result of recent SEC insurance industry guidance relating to the use of terminology, what we previously referred to as operating income, we now refer to as core income. As we explained in the press release, we have also relabeled related terms. To be clear, this is a wording change, and there were no changes in the calculation of these amounts. And now Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported core income of $614 million and core return on equity of 10.8%, both of which are impacted by $226 million of after-tax catastrophe losses. About half of those losses arose out of storms occurring in the last 2 weeks of March. That kind of weather volatility is certainly in our playbook, but we'd normally expect it a few weeks later in the second quarter. To give you some context, according to the National Weather Service, reported hale, tornado and wind activity in the quarter was almost 2.5 times higher than the 5-year average. The quarter also had 12 PCS wind and hail cat events, an all-time record for Q1. That surpasses the record that was set just last year. As sometimes happens in this business, the weather in the quarter obscures what was otherwise a very good start to the year. Our underlying combined ratio was strong at 91.7%. Importantly, our Personal Auto bodily injury losses were within expectations and the same is generally true for loss trends across all our businesses. In addition to underlying underwriting profitability, we were also pleased with our investment results this quarter with net investment income increasing 9% over the prior year quarter. Turning to production. For all our business segments, we were pleased with our execution in the marketplace, including the record level of premium we wrote in the quarter. In our Commercial businesses, the markets in which we operate remain stable. We continue to achieve historically high levels of retention of 85% in domestic business insurance and 88% in Bond & Specialty Insurance. Renewal rate change improved somewhat over recent quarters, and as always, what's important is the texture underneath the headline numbers. For example, in our core Middle Market business, renewal rate change improved more than 1 point compared to the first quarter of last year. And during the current quarter, Middle Market renewal rate change was positive on 59% of our accounts compared to 53% of our accounts in the prior year quarter. This is the result of our efforts to seek rate selectively and thoughtfully to meet our return objectives in light of the persistently low interest rate environment and the fact that rate change has been below loss trend for a few years now. It's a similar story in our Management Liability business. Contrast that to our Select business, where rate change has been positive and stable for 3 quarters but modestly below where it was a year ago. Given the returns in this portfolio, we were comfortable with the renewal rate change and pleased to see retention in new business levels up, both sequentially and year-over-year. In Personal Insurance, we are encouraged that so far we have been successful in implementing the pricing and underwriting actions that we discussed with you last quarter to improve profitability in our Auto business. And we were very pleased to have maintained momentum in growing our profitable Homeowners business. All in for the company, net written premiums were up 5% compared to the prior year quarter. Brian will take you to the production data and top line results in more detail, but I'll note that, to a very large degree, the growth reflects a combination of higher levels of retention and higher renewal rate change. That speaks to the quality of the premium growth. During the quarter, we were pleased to have announced our agreement to acquire Simply Business, a technology company and a leading digital provider of insurance to small businesses in the United Kingdom. In addition to a number of immediate benefits, like a profitable and growing business in the U.K. and access to talent with leading expertise in digital commerce in our industry, this is a medium- and long-term strategic transaction for us. It's about building important capabilities. It's digital R&D that will give us important insights into serving our customers and working more efficiently with our distribution partners. It's about making sure that we're positioned to serve the customer however, whenever and from wherever they choose to engage with us. We would have undertaken to develop these capabilities in any event and teaming up with the company and people that have been at it for over a decade and that are leading the way, gives us an important head start. Our agreement to acquire Simply Business is an example of our investing thoughtfully and strategically in the business, building on the meaningful competitive advantages that have enabled us to deliver industry-leading returns over time. And just as we have for more than a decade, we'll make investments like that for the long term and continue to right size capital by returning excess capital to our shareholders. There's no change in our capital management philosophy. While Jay Benet will have more to say about our capital management, I'm pleased to report that as a reflection of confidence in our business, today our Board of Directors declared a 7.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.72 per share. This marks the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases. So wrapping up, weather was a factor this quarter. But the underlying results of the business were strong, we're well positioned for continued success over the near term, and we're excited about the investments we're making for sustained success over time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Alan. Core income was $614 million, down from 698 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 10.8%, down from 12.5%. There were several moving pieces this quarter, so let me spend a few minutes providing you with some further insight into these numbers. I'll start by saying that the absolute levels as well as the reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by underlying performance, rather they reflected the relatively high level of tornado hail that Alan discussed, along with the impact of the so-called Ogden rate adjustment, the U.K. Ministry of Justice's decision to reduce the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts from a plus 2.5% to minus 0.75%. Beginning with underwriting, Cat losses were $226 million after tax, $19 million higher than the already high $207 million after tax in the prior year quarter. Page 4 of the webcast provides an analysis as to how our first quarter results compared to analyst estimates and, as best as we can tell, analyst estimates for cat losses appear to be significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Net favorable prior year reserve development, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly, was 44 million after tax, which was $75 million less than the prior year quarter, mostly due to Ogden. While remaining strong, as evidenced by a 91.7% underlying combined ratio, our underlying underwriting gain was lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to two things. The first was normal fluctuations in non-cat weather and other loss activity. And the second, as we had anticipate it, was the timing impact of Personal Auto bodily injury loss estimates that were consistent with the higher loss trends that we had recognized in the second half of 2016. Partially offsetting these reductions in the underlying underwriting gain, but not impacting the combined ratio, was a $39 million tax benefit from successfully closing out our federal income tax exams for 2013 and '14. Turning to investment results, which was strong. Net investment income of $480 million after tax increased by 9% or $41 million as compared to the prior year quarter. Non fixed income NII increased by $59 million after tax, primarily due to strong private equity returns more than offsetting the fully anticipated $17 million after tax decrease in fixed income NII that was driven by the continued low interest rate environment. Consolidated net favorable prior year development was $81 million pretax, driven almost entirely by Business and International as compared to $180 million pretax in the prior year quarter. The quarter included the previously announced reserve increase of $62 million pretax that resulted from the Ogden rate change. Since this reserve increase primarily related to our public liability and commercial auto liability lines of business in the U.K., approximately two thirds of which are in runoff, any impact of this Ogden rate change on our future operating results is expected to be insignificant. Excluding the impact of Ogden, Business and International had net favorable reserve development of $133 million pretax, up from $93 million pretax in the prior year quarter and driven once again by better than expected loss experienced in Workers' Comp and General Liability. Bond & Specialty had net favorable development of $10 million pretax, while Personal Insurance had no prior year reserve development, which was an improvement from the unfavorable development we experienced in the two most recent quarters. On a combined stat Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter. Operating cash flows of $775 million remain very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion at year end 2016 and higher than normal for us. This increase in holding company liquidity resulted from moving the excess capital that was generated by our highly profitable fourth quarter 2016 from our operating companies to the holding company, coupled with our decision to moderate share repurchases in first quarter 2017 to provide financing flexibility for our pending acquisition of Simply Business. As Alan said, there was no change in our capital management strategy. In the coming weeks, taking into account then current capital market conditions, we'll finalize our financing plans for Simply Business, which will likely include some combination of debt and internal resources. And once we've made that determination, we'll return remaining excess capital to our shareholders. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.3 billion pretax or $0.8 billion after tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $84.51 and adjusted book value per share of $81.56 increased 2% and 1%, respectively, from the beginning of the year. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $476 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $190 million and repurchased $286 million of our common shares this quarter, including $225 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and $61 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.67 to $0.72 per share and authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases. With that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.\nBrian MacLean: Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter's results in Business and International Insurance. Segment income was $468 million, with a combined ratio of 96.3%, a strong result even with the impacts of above-average catastrophe losses and the $51 million after tax related to the Ogden rate adjustment. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 94.5%, up a little more than a point compared to the first quarter of 2016, due to normal quarterly variability in weather related and other loss activity, along with loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing. Net written premiums for the quarter of over $4 billion, a record level, were up 3% year-over-year. Domestic Business Insurance premiums were up 2.5 points, driven by strong production results in Select and Middle Market. International net written premiums were up 6%, due primarily to the timing of certain adjustments in the first quarter of both years. Turning to Domestic Production. Our focus continues to be on retaining our business. And accordingly, we were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at historically high levels. Renewal premium change came in at 2.8 points, up 0.5 point from the fourth quarter of 2016 and included positive renewal rate change of about 0.5. New business was $532 million, down from a very strong prior year quarter. Looking at the individual businesses. Beginning with Select, where we continue to make product and technology investments to drive growth. And we're pleased with the progress we're making as evidenced by this quarter's production statistics. Retention of 83% has remained at historically high levels for three consecutive quarters. Renewal premium change was over five points and new business premiums of $121 million was the highest level since the first quarter of 2012. In Middle Market, our results reflect a continued stable marketplace. Retention of 88% was at historically high levels, while renewal premium change was nearly three points and included about a point of renewal rate change. Our new business writings continued to reflect our underwriting standards and return objectives, and although down from last year, were in line with our expectations. The combination of strong retention, positive RPC and solid new business levels resulted in meaningful premium growth during the quarter. In Other Business Insurance, renewal premium change was up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 with renewal rate change that was flat. Retention came in at 79% and new business premiums were $121 million. In International, production was also very strong in the quarter. Retention improved to 84%, while renewal premium change was slightly positive and new business volumes are strong. So all in for the segment, it was a good start to 2017. I'll now turn to Bond & Specialty Insurance, where segment income for the quarter of $129 million was strong, though down somewhat from the prior year driven by a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by the segment's portion of the tax item that Jay mentioned earlier. The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was very strong and unchanged from the prior year. As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up slightly for both Surety and Management Liability. In our Management Liability business, we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best performing accounts, while writing new business in return adequate product segments. So we couldn't be more pleased that retention for the quarter again came in at historically high levels at 88%, while we continued to add a substantial level of new business. Renewal premium change of 4.4 points was up from recent quarters, reflecting a modest increase in average policy duration along with improvement in the rate component of RPC. Shifting from the financials, I'd like to comment on 2 things that we did in the quarter to advance our product offerings. First, we added to our expertise in Surety by bringing on board Family Business Institute, a specialist in strategic planning services for closely held construction businesses. We also entered into an agreement with Symantec Corp. to provide our cyber policy holders with leading cyber risk services. These actions will allow us to deliver additional value-added services to our customers, further enhancing our industry-leading product portfolio. So Bond & Specialty results remain terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and our position in the market. Turning to Personal Insurance. Net written premiums for the segment grew 12% in the quarter, with a combined ratio of just under 100%. As you've already heard, there was a historically high level of tornado hail activity in the quarter. And as a result, catastrophe losses of 10 points were significantly higher than our expectations. Excluding the impact of cats, the underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations. Weather aside, both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners got off to a good start toward achieving the goals we laid out in the fourth quarter earnings call. The Agency Auto combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1%, and consistent with the segment, the cat component was larger than we would normally expect in the first quarter, with catastrophe losses accounting for 2.5 points. The underlying combined ratio came in at 98.6%. Excluding cats, first quarter auto loss experience was in line with our expectations. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio is up 4.6 points. As you can see on Page 18 of the webcast, 3.2 points of the increase was due to the timing of the higher run rate of bodily injury losses that we recognized in the second half of 2016 and that Jay mentioned earlier. The remaining 1.5 points was primarily due to the additional impact of tenure, which resulted from the earning-in of the increased levels of new business that we wrote last year. As we explained a couple of quarters ago, while the higher level of new business is creating loss ratio pressure in the short term, we believe it is a good thing for the long-term economic value of the portfolio. As we mentioned last quarter, in response to the higher bodily injury loss levels, we're taking actions to improve profitability, and our primary response is to improve the pricing of the book. Renewal premium change ticked up in the quarter to 5.9%, reflecting some of the impact of rate changes that have been approved thus far. As additional rate filings are approved and impact policies at the renewal date, we expect RPC to increase sequentially each quarter, likely approaching double digits in the third quarter. The rate of TIF growth both sequentially and year-over-year, slowed modestly in the quarter. While within the quarter, the monthly rate of growth decelerated, reflecting our efforts to manage growth while profitability improves. As we said last quarter, it will take time for the actions we're implementing to fully earn into the portfolio, but the first quarter results are on track with our expectations. Turning to Agency Homeowners and Other, we believe the quarter's results once again reinforced the value of providing portfolio solutions. In a quarter when our combined ratio included 19 points of cat losses, more than double our expectation, we still posted a 96.7% combined ratio. The underlying combined of 77.6% was a little more than 1 point higher than the first quarter of 2016, due primarily to higher levels of non-cat weather. Importantly, net written premium and policies in force both grew at an accelerating rate in the quarter despite moderation in the growth rates for Auto. The 4% growth in net written premiums was the strongest result since 2011. We said in recent quarters that it was important for us to maintain focus on generating growth in our Homeowners book, and we feel good about the results so far in 2017. So for the segment as a whole, we're encouraged by our first quarter results. Before I turn it over to Gabby, I'd like to comment on a change in the reporting of our segment results going forward. Effective April 1, 2017, the company's results will be reported in 3 business segments: Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. With this change, the company's international businesses, which were previously reported in total within the Business and International segment, will now be disaggregated amongst these 3 newly aligned business segments. This change doesn't reflect the shift in strategy. Given the progress that we've achieved within our international businesses, we believe that the newly aligned segments will allow us to more effectively engage the product capabilities and talent across both our domestic and international operations. With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. We're ready to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Please proceed.\nAmit Kumar: Two questions, the first question is, I guess, going back to the discussion on the Personal Auto book, you talked about the higher underlying loss ratio, which is not a surprise. I'm curious, how should we think about that loss ratio, either stabilizing at the current level or ticking up or down going forward based on the market environment.\nMichael Klein: This is Michael Klein. So in terms of the underlying, you see the 3.2 points on Page 18. When we talked about that last quarter, we talked about the fact that the full year impact of that in 2016 was about 3.5 points. The fact that 3.2 versus 3.5, there's some quarterly fluctuation in what that number will be quarter to quarter, but underlying coming into the year, we've got a 3.5 point gap that as we talked about last quarter we're working to close. The amount to which that starts to get reduced will, again, as we talked about, sort of earn in over 18 to 24 months as the rate comes through. So there's a couple of things going on there. There's the rate that we're taking that will eventually eat into that 3.5 points, but there's certainly an unfavorable year over year comparison for the first three quarters of this year because we don't have the full 3.5 points recognized till you get to the basis of the full year 2016.\nAmit Kumar: Okay. The other question I had and this is switching gears on I guess, the broader reserve releases and some other questions we've gotten from investors have obviously focused on the lower level of reserve releases. Bond & Specialty was higher in Q1 2016 due to the AOI experience back in 2016. I'm curious, was that sort of a one off benefit we got in Q1 2016? And hence, we should be careful how we think about reserve releases going forward. Or am I over thinking the meaningful decline in reserve releases this quarter?\nJay Benet: Hi. This is Jay Benet. Let me start by saying what we always remind people of. That is, that every quarter, we're looking at, literally, all the reserves, doing lots of analysis and when there's an indication that the reserves needs to change, we make those changes. So we always try to get and always get our best estimate of what those reserves are on a quarter by quarter basis. We've seen things take place in all of the segments that in different quarters have led to mostly favorable development, although we did have a little unfavorable development in Personal Insurance last year. So I don't look at the reserves and try to predict anything in terms of patterns, in terms of intent, in terms of how things are going to emerge. I think of it more as episodic, and that we had large -- larger reserve development in Bond & Specialty last year versus a smaller amount this year. I just look at, that's just what the data said, and we'll see what the data brings in subsequent quarters.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of a Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.\nJay Gelb: For Personal Auto, I was a little surprised at the persistent high level of policy in force growth at 12%, given the efforts to fix profitability there, can you give us a bit more insight on that?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Jay. This is Michael Klein. So the one thing I would point out about policy in force growth, particularly if you're looking at that 12% year on year number, is that's really a lagging indicator of growth. So think of the 12% as the 12 month weighted average of the growth we've seen over the last 12 months, right? It's this year's policy in force in the quarter relative to the first quarter of last year. So there's built into that 12% number, primarily is the growth we saw last year. That said, Brian mentioned growth decelerated within the quarter. So what you'll see as you look forward and what we expect is that annual policy in force growth number will come down, but it will come down relatively slowly, again, because of sort of the embedded volume already in the back half of 2016. To Brian's comments about growth decelerating in the quarter, we've seen and you can look at it in the production statistics, a bit of a drop in renewal retention in response to the rate. But also importantly, we're essentially where we expected to be. We continue to see win rates come down as we put rate into the marketplace. And then equally importantly, we talked about at bats last quarter, the efforts we've undertaken to take underwriting action and manage the flow of quote volume into the business have started to take hold, and so where it's actually seeing our quote activity and our win rates come down consistent with expectation and the growth continue to moderate.\nAlan Schnitzer: Jay, it's Alan. I would just emphasize what Michael said that we were generally able to achieve what we wanted to achieve, and we generally are where we expected to be. So a quarter past, what we talked to you about last quarter, so far so good.\nJay Gelb: I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is on the buyback and how the Simply Business acquisition affected that. So in the Q, it says the Simply Business acquisition was total consideration of around $490 million. I thought an acquisition of that size might not have slowed the pace of buybacks in the quarter. And I'm just trying to think about what the implications are for buybacks going forward.\nJay Benet: Yes. Jay, this is Jay. The way we manage capital, as you recall, we're preserving capital for organic growth in our business and for any kind of activity that would add to shareholder value over time. So what we looked at here was a relatively modest acquisition, given the size of Travelers. But it does impact the resource space that we have. So in this particular case, what we've decided to do in the first quarter was just hold back a little bit on share repurchases. We know we have an obligation that this thing will close later in the year. We never rely on capital markets being favorable or open or whatever. We take a very conservative look. So all we've done is held back some funds to be able to unequivocally close on the transaction. As we said before, as we get closer to finalizing our financing plans for it, which will be a combination of debt and some of the internal capital, we'll make a final determination as to what the capital level should be, and then return the remaining excess. So I wouldn't look into it as anything other than some cash planning on our part, and no change whatsoever in the whole capital management strategy in the place.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of a Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nSarah DeWitt: Could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of loss trends in Business Insurance? Do you expect any upward pressure there? I know last quarter, you talked a little bit about how the propensity to litigate in Auto had spread to Small Commercial.\nAlan Schnitzer: Sarah, good morning. It's Alan. I would say, broadly speaking, we haven't seen any significant changes in loss trend in really any of our commercial businesses. And I think you mentioned propensity to litigate. That's not exactly right. What we've seen is a little bit of an increase in attorney representation. And that, actually, we're typically seeing it at smaller less complex cases. So not necessarily increased litigation, just a factor that takes longer to settle the cases and sometimes results in ordering more medical diagnostics, things like that. That's impacting severity. But that's actually not new. We've been seeing that manifest itself on our commercial businesses probably over a couple of years. But I would say, broadly speaking, Sarah, no real change in what's been a pretty favorable loss trend environment. Now in terms of the way we think about that and price and set reserves, we always assume things will return to longer-term normal, but I would say, maybe with the exception of Auto that's been persistently difficult, really no change.\nSarah DeWitt: Okay, great. And then in Business Insurance, you've been taking modest renewal rate increases for the past 2 quarters, but you mentioned it's still below loss trends. What would need to happen for you to take rates to keep up with loss trends?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, first of all, we'd have to keep going. And I guess I'd step back, Sarah, and I would say that what we were able to do in the quarter reflects what we were trying to do in the quarter. It was very small, very thoughtful, very subtle shifts, and it's just a reflection of what we thought we needed to do, given what's happened to interest rates and where pricing has been relative to loss trends over a couple of years now. And so we were really encouraged by what we were able to accomplish, and we'll see where that goes in the future. I would point out that we've told you in Business Insurance broadly, loss trends about 4%. Rate would not need to get to 4% in order to be flat because, as we've said before, there's real economic impact from incremental exposure that we're getting. And there's other levers we can pull to improve profitability. And we've talked about those before, terms and conditions, mix, expenses, claims handling, other strategic investments. So all those things add up, Sarah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. \nKai Pan: First question to follow up on the Personal Auto side. The 140-basis-point deterioration, it's, if you're excluding the reinstate, reestimates, that's assuming mostly coming from the new business drag or tenure impact. If your TIF growth is gradually slowing down, is that impact will drag on for a little bit longer?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Kai, this is Michael. Couple of comments and one, just to remind everybody, there is also seasonality in the overall underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. So the 98.6% for the first quarter is reflective of, generally speaking, a lower underlying loss ratio in the first quarter than for the balance of the year. So I just wanted to clarify that point. In terms of the 1.5 or so drag from tenure, you're right, that will mitigate over time. But remember that it's not just the new business we've just recently written. It's the cohorts of business we've written over the last couple of years, earning their way through the book. So as we've talked about in the past, the reduction in the tenure impact is something that we measure in years, not quarters. So it will take a while for that to roll off.\nKai Pan: Okay, great. My follow-up question is on Simply Business. So Alan, I just wonder, could you explore a little bit about the strategic rationale behind it? And why do you do that in the U.K. rather than do that in the U.S.? And do you expect to expand that platform in the U.S. market, because you have a dominant, kind of like a leading position in Small Business Insurance here?\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure, Kai. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We've been thinking about everything changing in the world for a long time. And clearly, one of the things changing most significantly and maybe poised to have the biggest impact on us is the world becoming more digital and more mobile. And so every aspect of our business has to get more digital and more mobile. And so that's the way we engage with our customers, the way we engage with our agents. We've got to be there when and however they want. It's the way we manufacture our products and underwrite our risks. It's the way we market our products. It's the way we manage our internal operations. It's about creating a better experience really for all of our constituencies, internally and externally. We've got to be faster, we've got to be more efficient and we've got to be more flexible. So we look around the world, and we think how are we going to develop those capabilities? And we've got two choices: we can develop it internally or we can see who's great at it, and see if we can bring that expertise in-house. And so you scan the world, and we see Simply Business. They've been a hugely successful customer-focused technology company for a dozen years. So it's not a startup. They've been at this a long time, and they've got a real demonstrated success in this. They've got technological capabilities, they've got know-how, a winning approach to innovation, all things that we think that we'll benefit from. And so we were going to develop these capabilities as I said, one way or another, and it turns out that we thought that the best solution for finding those capabilities and bringing them in-house in terms of where they resided, a great cultural fit, and who we actually think the market leader is, it was Simply Business and they happen to be in the UK That fits nicely with us. We've got a business in the UK We've got a very small budding direct Small Commercial business there. Fits nicely. And even before we had started conversations with Simply Business, they had made a decision to bring their model to the United States. So that's even before early stage. I would say that's just getting started. But our ability to help them accelerate that in the U.S., I think was really attractive to them and the capabilities they bring to us is attractive to us. So it started in the UK, and we'll bring it to the U.S. and potentially other geographies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of a Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.\nPaul Newsome: I'm curious about the change in the International business. Could you -- in one sense, you said that the strategy isn't changing, but it sounds like there is some change going on there, either from a who's in charge kind of position or something else that would drive the segment change. Could you just give us a little bit more color on what actually is changing from a business perspective as opposed to a reporting perspective?\nAlan Schnitzer: It really is a way -- it's -- this is completely born out of the way that we plan to manage the business and really, it's the opportunity we think we have to leverage our terrific know-how and capabilities in the U.S. to deliver those capabilities outside of the U.S. It's really -- not that that's not significant, but it's nothing more significant than that. It's not a different approach the way we think about the opportunity outside the U.S., it's just a different approach to how we think we can best deliver our capabilities. And we've been on a journey for eight or so years now in trying to invest in and improve our international businesses. We've invested in technology, we've invested in talent, we've -- we're running a better railroad, and we've had a lot of success. And so the leadership that's brought us there will continue to be actively involved in managing those businesses as a portfolio. We'll have an ongoing obligation to manage those companies on a standalone basis, because we've got regulated entities in the various countries, and we'll continue to do that with the great leadership that has always done that. But we've got an opportunity with the talent and the capabilities in the U.S. to just do a better job of leveraging that outside of the U.S.\nJon Newsome: But there's nobody is there an actually a change in who reports to who or anything like that in those segments?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, it's -- we've always had a matrix reporting structure, and we'll continue to have a matrix reporting structure of the international business and our the people that run the countries will continue to report to Kevin Smith, and he'll have responsibility for that. But beneath that organizational alignment, we'll look at Greg Toczydlowski for Business Insurance and Tom Kunkel for Bond & Specialty and Michael Klein for Personal Insurance, and they will, on a matrix basis, manage their product delivery outside the United States. It's not it's actually not that different than the way we've thought about it all along. It's just an opportunity to reinforce the engagement on a product level.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of a Randy Binner with FBR. Please proceed.\nRandy Binner: I had a follow up to Amit's question earlier. And the question is, how are actual severity trends developing relative to the assumption you made, call it, late last year? And if there's commentary on frequency as well, this is in Auto, of course. I'm just wondering, yes, I know that you are re-pricing against elevated trend, but anecdotally, we all observe, I think kind of continued challenges in auto accident frequency and severity. So the question is, how is the actual loss environment developing relative to that re-pricing assumption that started late last year?\nMichael Klein: Yes. So Randy, it's Michael. The actual development is consistent with the re-pricing assumptions, whether that's the 3.5 points of elevated bodily injury losses that are now in the underlying or whether it's the elevated level of loss trend that we talked to you about in the fourth quarter that we added to our pricing. So as we sit here today, the experience in the first quarter of 2017 developed consistent with those expectations. The only thing I just want to add a point back to the question from Kai, and I think it was implied in my answer, but the 1.5 of tenure impact that we're talking about year on year is year on year, and therefore, that's not the full amount of tenure impact, right? There's -- there was tenure impact in the base in 2016, the 1.5 point is an additional 1.5 point on top of that, just to clarify. But to your question, the experience thus far this year has been consistent with both the elevated starting point and the elevated trend that we factored into our expectations.\nRandy Binner: Okay, great. And then, I guess, the follow up there is understanding that and understanding the price that you're moving, you're putting into the market. Do you see Travelers as an auto insurance company that's going to gain market share because of the dislocation out there with some of the mutual's really having to push very high pricing? Or do you see yourself kind of in the middle or potentially losing market share as we see market share dislocation in U.S. auto insurance?\nMichael Klein: Sure. So just a couple of points. First of all, in 2016, we gained share ever so slightly, 0.1 point based on the growth that we experienced last year. Certainly, coming into this quarter, you see the TIF growth at 12%, you see the period to period TIF growth at 2%. We would view in the first quarter, our growth probably outpacing the market. That said, our objective is to improve profitability and manage growth. So our the glide path we're trying to move the business down is one to reduce the growth rate but continue to grow as we manage profitability. What that amounts to in terms of market share really depends on what happens with the other players in the marketplace. We would tell you that the pricing actions that we're putting into market, again, consistent with our view of the loss trends being environmental, we're not alone in terms of driving rate. But what that ultimately amounts to in terms of share, we'll have to wait and see.\nAlan Schnitzer: And Randy, we don't really manage to market share, we manage to returns, profitability, balancing that with growth, and market share will fall out of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: First question, I was hoping to get some additional color on your outlook for the Business Insurance pricing environment. In the Q, you guys point to the renewal premium change basically being consistent with the Q1 for the balance of the year. So I mean, how do you view kind of pricing compared to expectations or any changes in the U.S. economy when you came to that outlook for the RPC?\nAlan Schnitzer: So Elyse, RPC obviously includes rate and exposure. And so it's a broader measure, and there's obviously a corridor around the words \"broadly consistent.\" And so we're probably not going to break that down into pure rate and exposure. Obviously, we thought we needed to get more pure rate in the first quarter. And as I said, we were encouraged, we were able to do that. I will say that the trends that lead us to do that, namely a lower interest rate environment and where rate has been for a while relative to loss trends, those trends still persist out there, and so we'll have to take that into account. And so we'll take it from there. Obviously, we operate in a competitive marketplace, and so that will be a factor. So we're encouraged and then we'll see where it goes.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you. And then just a couple of numbers question and going back to the Personal Auto book. If I look at your underlying loss ratio this Q1 compared to the adjusted last year, it seems like there's about 2.5 points of deterioration. You guys said year-over-year the delta was about 1.5 points that changed from tenure. So what else am I missing when I look at that calculation, since it's adjusted with the elevated trends last Q1? And a second-part question in terms of the auto margins, your expense ratio in the Personal Auto book came down in the fourth quarter, and then also with that, that kind of lower level this quarter. How do you think about the expense ratio for the Auto book when you think about your margin outlook for that business for the balance of 2017?\nMichael Klein: Yes. So Elyse, it's Michael, to your point I'll start with expense ratio. We continue to manage expenses on a pretty disciplined basis inside PI, and we're enjoying the benefit of the increased volume over relatively flat expense base. And that continues to be our plan going forward. In terms of the other components of loss ratio, it's really normal period-to-period fluctuation. There's nothing -- there's some puts and takes underneath that, but it's really normal period-to-period fluctuation has explained those other changes in the underlying.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of a Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.\nRyan Tunis: I guess my first one was just a follow up on Alan's comments about -- in Domestic, the positive rate indication this quarter on 59% of the book versus 53% a year ago. And I guess, just thinking a little bit more granularly, what is leading to the upward rate indication? Is there pressure on certain accounts? Or is it, I think the point you made just several years of rate running below loss cost trend?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, good morning, Ryan. So we manage the business on a very granular level with a return objective in mind. And we had a bunch of years going back to 2010 or '11, where we had a rising rate environment and that put us in a very good position in terms of where our earned and written returns were. And since, I don't know, beginning of 2014 or so, we've been in an environment where rate's been below loss trend, and we've had low, continued low interest rate environment. I think the 10-year this morning was slightly over 2.2% or something like that. And so over time those things have an impact. And while today, we're satisfied with our [written] returns, we look out the windshield into the future and see where things are going, and it causes us to, again, very selectively, very thoughtfully in a way that we think makes sense, given our portfolio, our returns, working with our distribution partners in a way that's never intended to be disruptive to them or our customers. We try to improve the return outlook. And not everywhere, I made the point, in our Select business was in a different position from our return perspective. And we were happy to take the rate where it was, where it's been over recent quarters, and so it's just very granular execution with the return objective in mind.\nRyan Tunis: That's helpful. And then, I guess, just following up on the line of questioning in Auto. I guess thinking about weather in Q1, it seemed like January, February, weather was somewhat benign. You had warmer temperatures. I'm wondering if, how you characterize the impact of weather on Auto in 1Q in the first quarter. I think the way to ask it is, how did frequency trend year-over-year?\nMichael Klein: Yes, again, I would say, broadly speaking, frequency and severity in the first quarter came in consistent with our expectation. I think, we talk about the impact of the weather, and we'll talk about warm temperatures, above freezing in cold months, can give you sometimes higher speeds and higher severity. Cold temperatures below freezing will give you ice and will give you more high frequency, low severity bumping into things. But you see those period-to-period fluctuations, and again, that's part of my point in the response to Elyse, is we got just normal period-to-period fluctuations, but we didn't see anything in the first quarter significantly different than our expectations.\nBrian MacLean: Well, and specifically, this is Brian. When you think of the first quarter cat activity, it's the tornado hail and specifically the hail that is driving the numbers. And that is usually the case. So especially in Auto, hail will bring about an immediate uptick. And that's what we saw in March, as Alan pointed out.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. So maybe over March, weather normalized some. Okay.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of a Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed. \nLawrence Greenberg: Just staying on Auto, are you seeing anything new in how you think about the long-term value of the business that you put on in the last couple of few years, probably undeniable that you'd, like to have repriced some of that a little bit earlier. But are you seeing anything new that would support or refute that this is business that you ultimately want and will be value enhancing over the long term?\nBrian MacLean: No, Larry, we're not. I mean, as we've talked about over the past several quarters, we're slicing and dicing it 18 ways to Sunday. But from a quality perspective, the quality of the business, the profile of the business is very consistent with what we targeted when we designed and developed and launched the Quantum Auto 2.0 product. Again, the profile of the business coming in doors is consistent with what we've been looking for. We continue to evaluate and examine that tenure impact and make sure that the business is tenuring consistent with our expectations. And so to your point from a long-term economic value perspective, it's tracking with our expectations. Again, we would have liked to have charged more for it, but that is really the primary conclusion. And that's why the strategy to improve the profitability is to go after it with base rate.\nAlan Schnitzer: And to the extent that we do keep it and improve profitability from an economic perspective, it'll be a good thing in terms of creating economic value.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of a Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: A couple of quick questions here. First, Brian, Alan, can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics right now in the Workers' Compensation insurance area? The premiums are down a little bit the last couple of quarters. And are you seeing any impact in the marketplace from, perhaps a competitor having some issues?\nBrian MacLean: Yes. So thanks, Brian. And I always preface our comments with we feel great about our Workers' Comp capabilities. We clearly feel we're the industry leader. We've got, between our underwritten book and our service book, the largest portfolio in the industry. So we know the line well. We know the difficulty there can be with any long-tail line and more than any business we have, incredibly granular, industry-by-industry, state-by-state, account-size-by-account-size. So we look at that a lot. Yes, pricing is -- so directionally, there is definitely good news on the loss trend side, now it's a very long tail line of business. So short-term movements in loss trend get blended in as we look at long-tail loss trend. But loss trends have been positive, but pricing is reacting and probably overreacting to that in the marketplace. So we're looking at it very closely. There has been some disruption with carriers out there in the market, and we are looking at that business closely. It's still got to meet the economic hurdles that we have in the profitability, so to the extent that there are opportunities out there that we think we can write at appropriately prices, and we're excited about it. But we'll look into that closely.\nBrian Meredith: Okay. Great. And then, next question, I'm just curious in the Management Liability area. What are you seeing with loss trends there?\nAlan Schnitzer: Nothing significant. There's been a lot written about securities class actions being up and the numbers may be up. I would say as it relates to us, we've got a very diversified Management Liability book. We manage positions in the tower and limits very carefully. And the activity that we've seen that's been at elevated levels is in industries where we're under-weighted. It's been biotech, pharma, health care, and we're under-weighted there. I'd also add that as you look at that commentary out there that suggests that numbers of security class actions are up, sometimes the methodology in counting the cases distorts the numbers. You've got to look at cases that were previously brought in state court that are now being brought in federal court for reasons you'd have to ask a plaintiff's bar about, but you really have to look at the aggregate of those two numbers to see the trends in claim counts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of a Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.\nJay Cohen: Most of my questions have been answered. But just one question. When you look at the difference in the renewal rate change versus the renewal premium change, that difference is much bigger in Select than it is for the broader Commercial or Business Insurance segment. And I'm wondering why that is. Why is there a bigger difference in Select?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Hey, Jay, this is Greg Toczydlowski. In the Select business, just given the smaller nature of those policies, we have a certain segment of the business that we call Express business and the CMP or the BOP portion has some inflationary guards inside there. So that's automatically applied, typically to the property line, so underneath the CMP or the BOP product. So that's one of the drivers. The other one is around Workers' Comp. Workers' Comp, we continue to see the type of mix that we're writing, some wage increases and some increases in payroll. So the combination of the two has really given us that exposure lift that we're getting in that business.\nJay Cohen: And Workers' Comp then is a bigger piece of the Select business than it is of the overall segments business?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Is the question as a percentage of the overall premium? It's got a similar mix profile, if that's the question.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.\nMeyer Shields: Very briefly, when you talk about reallocating the international business to the individual segments, can you talk broadly about what impact that would have on the reported underlying combined ratios?\nBrian MacLean: Just procedurally, one of the things we're in the process of doing is reconstituting the 10-K information as well as the supplement. So just in line with your question, we'll be providing this kind of data to you in advance of the webcast for the second quarter. We expect late in the second quarter to get the information out into the public. But I think when you look at the overall size of the various segments versus the size of the international operations, I think the impact on the combined ratios will generally be pretty modest.\nAlan Schnitzer: And just to state the obvious, when you look at the consolidated number for prior periods, there will be no change, right? It'll be modest reallocation among the segments, but relatively small impact.\nMeyer Shields: Right. No, that makes sense. And then, the Simply Business acquisition, where are we going to see those earnings in the segments and then in the income statement?\nJay Benet: Simply Business, will be part we expect it to be part of the Business Insurance segment. So it'll be there, but we'll see how we'll present that. I mean, it'll be part of the segment, it'll be wrapped in. But again, and just in terms of the size of the Business Insurance segment, Simply Business will be a pretty small piece of that.\nGabriella Nawi: Excellent. That concludes our call for today. Thank you very much for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day."}], "2019": [{"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 4, "year": 2018, "date": "2019-01-22 16:40:47", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on January 22, 2019. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter 2018 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our Web site at travelers.com, under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, CFO; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance, who is joining us remotely this morning; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements, including as it relates to our discussion of our outlook. The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in our Investors section on our Web site. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we look back on 2018, we are pleased that we improved returns, grew our business, and delivered strong underlying underwriting profitability and investment results, while returning significant excess capital to shareholders and taking great care of our customers. Our results benefited from ongoing strategic initiatives geared toward creating top line opportunities and improving productivity and efficiency. Of course our results were also impacted by a high level of catastrophe losses. Fourth quarter net income of $621 million or $2.32 per diluted share generated a return on equity of 10.9%. Core income was $571 million or $2.13 per diluted share and core return on equity was 10%. Net and core income were both impacted by almost $500 million of after-tax CAT losses. Our full-year core income increased by 19% to $2.4 billion, generating core return on equity of 10.7%. The fact that we were able to generate this level of profit and profitability with $1.4 billion in after-tax CAT losses speaks to the earnings power of our franchise. Our consolidated underlying combined ratio for the fourth quarter improved to 91.1%, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2016, even after the impact on the quarter of a full-year worth of higher loss estimates in the commercial auto line, driven by bodily injury severity. Commercial auto has been a challenge for the industry and for us for some time and our most recent data reflects further deterioration. Greg will address more detail of what we've seen and how we\u2019re responding. For the full-year, a record earned premium of more than $27 billion and productivity and efficiency initiatives contributed to an after-tax underlying underwriting gain of $1.5 billion, the highest in more than a decade. Our successful and consistent investment strategy also contributed to our results. After-tax net investment income was up 15% for the quarter and 12% for the year. The underwriting gain in investment income also reflects the benefit of tax reform. These results together with our strong balance sheet enable us to grow adjusted book value per share by 5% during the year after returning more than $2.1 billion of excess capital to shareholders, consistent with our long-standing capital management strategy. Turning to production, we remain very pleased with our performance in the market with each of our business segments contributing to a 4% increase in net written premium for the quarter. For the year we grew net written premiums by 6% to a record $27.7 billion. Net written premiums and business insurance in the quarter increased by nearly $100 million or 3% driven by historically high retention and positive renewal premium change. In our middle market business, retention reached a record fourth quarter high of 88%. We completed the rollout of our business centers in our commercial accounts business during the year. All eligible renewals in new business are now flowing to these centers, freeing up our local underwriters to spend more time with our agent and broker partners. For the year, commercial accounts delivered its highest level of new business in more than a decade. Renewal premium change in business insurance, including pure rate and exposure, was nearly 5% in the quarter, up over half a point compared to the same period last year and steady throughout 2018. We achieved positive renewal premium change in all lines. In our Bond & Specialty business, net written premiums increased by 8% for the quarter with continued strong production in both our management liability and surety businesses. In Domestic Management Liability, we achieved record retention and new business for the full-year. In Personal Insurance, net written premium growth in the quarter was strong at 5% with both our agency auto and homeowners businesses contributing. Two years ago, in 2016, we had a $4 billion book of agency auto business was in profitability challenges. Today, it's a $5 billion business that meets our return expectations. Thanks to impressive execution by the team and an improved environment, we got there ahead of schedule. We will hear more shortly from Greg, Tom, and Michael about our segment results. To wrap it up, despite another year of elevated catastrophe losses, we achieved an 11% return on equity. That speaks to excellent underwriting execution and management of risk and reward across a diverse portfolio of businesses, our successful investment strategy, and our active approach to capital management. It also speaks to the dedication and commitment of our 30,000 employees. With the talented team, competitive advantages that set us apart and an ambitious innovation agenda, along with a very high respect for our shareholders capital, we remain very well positioned to continue to deliver leading results and meaningful shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $571 million, down from $633 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 10%, down from 11.1%. The decrease in both measures from last year's fourth quarter resulted primarily from a higher level of catastrophe losses and a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development. Underlying results were strong as the consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91.1%, which excludes the impacts of CATs and PYD, improved by 1.3 points from the prior year quarter. Recall that last year's fourth quarter underlying combined ratio was elevated by about half a point as a result of tax planning actions taken at that time. Our fourth quarter results include $610 million of pre-tax CAT losses, driven by $453 million from the California wildfires in November and $158 million from hurricane Michael in October. Last year's fourth quarter CAT losses of $499 million included favorable development of $157 million, primarily related to the hurricanes from the third quarter of 2017. PYD in the current quarter for which I will provide more detail shortly was net favorable $167 million pre-tax, down from $293 million in the prior year quarter. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $578 million improved by 22% from $472 million in the prior year quarter as increases in both Bond & Specialty and personal insurance were partially offset by a decrease in business insurance which Greg will address in his comments. Pre-tax net investment income increased by 5% from the prior year quarter to $630 million as increases in fixed income were partially offset by lower pre-tax returns in our non-fixed income portfolio compared to very strong performance in the prior year quarter. Fixed income results benefited from the more favorable interest rate environment and an increase in average invested assets resulting from continued growth in net written premiums. After-tax NII increased by 15% to $535 million benefiting from the lower U.S corporate income tax rate. After-tax fixed income NII in the fourth quarter increased by $65 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and we expect that 2019 fixed income NII will increase by approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter compared to the corresponding periods of 2018, as we projected both the average level of invested assets and the average yield on the portfolio will be higher. All three segments experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in the fourth quarter. In Personal Insurance, recent accident years performed better-than-expected in the auto book. In Bond & Specialty, we experienced better-than-expected loss development in the management liability book. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $48 million pre-tax was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in domestic workers comp, which was largely offset by unfavorable development in commercial auto and to a lesser extent general liability. Commercial auto unfavorable PYD in the quarter was $155 million pre-tax resulting from elevated severity in recent accident years. In General Liability were the return remain attractive, unfavorable PYD in the quarter reflected changes across several accident years in business units. There is no broad theme with the largest impact related to a small number of claims from older years in our runoff book. For the full-year, despite the adverse changes in commercial auto and the third quarter asbestos charge, net favorable prior year reserve development was $517 million pre-tax. When our combined 2018 Schedule P is filed early in the second quarter, we expected to show that excluding asbestos and environmental, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had minor unfavorable development except for commercial auto and as a result of the change in commercial auto accident year 2017. Page 19 of the webcast provides information about our January 1 CAT Treaty renewal. Our corporate CAT aggregate XOL treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single CAT events and the aggregation of losses from multiple CAT events. As you all know, the industry has experienced an elevated level of catastrophe losses in recent years. In response, we have updated our actuarial models to reflect the actual results of recent years and to give more weight to recent years when determining our view of normal expectations. As a result, we\u2019ve recognized somewhat higher level of expected losses in our pricing and underwriting models. In further recognition of recent weather activity and ongoing uncertainty for 2019, we have also added a new catastrophe aggregate XOL treaty as described on Slide 19. This treaty addresses qualifying PCS designated events in North America for which we incur losses of $5 million or more providing aggregate coverage of $430 million part of $500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. Hurricane and earthquake events have a $250 million per occurrence cap. We believe this new treaty provides a reasonable level of protection at an appropriate price. In terms of the accounting, there will be an impact on the underlying combined ratio in 2019 due to the effect of seated premiums on total net earned premiums. Since the majority of any loss recoveries from this treaty will likely benefit our net catastrophe losses, which are excluded from underlying results, we expect about a half a point impact on the full-year underlying combined ratio, but a minimal impact on the full-year total combined ratio because the attachment point is $1.3 billion, we also expect that any recoveries would likely be recorded in the second half of the year and accordingly the impact on the combined ratio will likely be more pronounced in the early part of 2019. Of course the actual effect on our total combined ratio for 2019 will be impacted by the level of PCS events we experience. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $948 million were again very strong, all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion. Interest rates decreased modestly during the fourth quarter and accordingly our net unrealized investment loss narrowed from $447 million after-tax as of September 30 to $113 million after-tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses with $87.27 at year-end, 5% higher than at the beginning of the year. We returned $375 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $170 million and dividends of $205 million. For the year, we returned more than $2.1 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. Consistent with our capital management strategy that level of return capital takes into consideration a variety of factors. For example, the increased level of capital in support of the nearly $2.8 billion of premium growth we have generated over the last two years, the amount of earnings and contributions to the pension plan and you'll recall that we made a $200 million contribution in September for tax planning purposes. And with that, I will turn the microphone over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $391 million of segment income, down from $637 million in the prior year quarter, bringing the full-year total to $1.64 billion, a 2% increase over 2017. Earnings for both the quarter and the year included the relatively high levels of catastrophe losses that Alan and Dan mentioned, as was the case in 2017. Earnings for both the quarter and the year were positively impacted by strong profitability in workers' comp, our biggest product line as well as higher overall business volumes that resulted from recent earned premium growth and increased operating leverage that has reduced our expense ratio. Earnings were negatively impacted by a fourth quarter after-tax charge of about $195 million or about $245 million on a pre-tax basis related to higher commercial auto bodily injury loss activity. Of that amount, about $155 million pre-tax reduced net favorable prior year reserve development. The remaining $90 million pre-tax represents the impact of the 2018 accident year and incorporates reestimations for the first three quarters of the year. The corresponding combined ratio impacts were approximately 6.5 points on the segment combined ratio for the quarter and a little more than 1.5 points on the segment combined ratio for the year. The impacts on the underlying combined ratio from the adverse auto adjustments were approximately 2.5 points for the quarter and a little more than a half a point for the full-year. As we\u2019ve discussed with you, in recent years we've reacted to higher commercial auto losses, a different portion of our Commercial Auto Book through various pricing, underwriting and reserving actions. But during the recent quarter, data emerge that changed our view of the overall loss environment broadly across our commercial auto book. We saw more of an increase in the rate of attorney involvement than we had anticipated and a lengthening in the claim development pattern. As a consequence, we're experiencing a higher level of bodily injury severity than we anticipated. Because we believe the factors we're experiencing are environmental, our primary plan of action going forward will be to push for more rate. As we mentioned in the past, the auto line is where we've been getting the most rate over the last couple of years, but we need more of it. It is important to remember that auto is typically part of an account solution for a business insurance customers. We generally provide them with some combination of workers comp, property, general liability and/or other coverages. Accordingly, we will use our extensive data and analytics capabilities on an account by account basis to improve auto profitability as the line and as part of the overall profitability of our product portfolio. Turning back to the segment results, the underlying combined ratio of 95.4% for the quarter was 1.5 points higher than in the prior year. The loss ratio was about 3 points higher than last year, driven by the 2.5 points from auto. The remaining half a point is due to higher non-weather loss activity in our international businesses with the largest contributor to that coming from Lloyd's, partially offset by favorable variability in domestic loss activity. The expense ratio for the quarter improved by 1.5 points with about half of that improvement coming from lower expense dollars and the other half coming from higher premium volumes. As always, there are fluctuations in expenses from quarter-to-quarter, so we pointed the full-year expense ratio as a better indication of our run rate. All in for the year, a 95.7 underlying combined ratio, which included large losses which ran about a point over what we would have view as a more normal level. Turning to top line in production, net written premium growth for the quarter was 3%, bringing the full-year total to $15 billion, almost $700 million or 5% higher than in 2017. We are pleased with our continued progress with our strategic initiatives and we remain encouraged with the feedback from our agent and broker partners that were focused on the right priorities. In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 4.8% in the quarter with renewal rate change of 1.6%, while retention remained high at 85%, a reflection of the quality of our book. New business of $488 million was up 3% from a year-ago. We are pleased with these production results and continue to operate at a granular level of executing in our marketplace strategy to meet our return objective with a thoughtful balance towards retaining our best business, improving pricing where it's needed and pursuing attractive new business opportunities. Turning to the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change and renewal rate ticked up a bit, while retention remained strong at 82%. New business was up 11% over the prior year quarter as we continue to leverage our investments in technology and workflow initiatives. In middle market, renewal premium change was 4.5% with renewal rate change consistent with last quarter at 1.5%, while retention remained historically high at 88%. As Alan said, a record for the fourth quarter. New business premiums of $281 million were down a bit from a strong level in the prior year quarter. And our core commercial accounts business where our business center initiatives are now fully rolled out, new business was up 17% for the quarter, while full-year new business premiums of $561 million were at the highest level in over a decade. In this business, we are pleased that the business centers and our strategic investments are having the intended impact. Submission and quote activity are both up from the prior year creating attractive top line opportunities. To sum up, we feel terrific about our execution in the marketplace and confident about how our position going forward. Before I turn the call over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty results, I want to comment on our outlook for RPC and the underlying combined ratio since we will not be filing our 10-K for a few weeks. We expect RPC will remain positive in 2019 and at the levels broadly consistent with 2018. We expect the underlying combined ratio for the full-year 2019 will be lower than in 2018, which assumes that large losses primarily in the property line return to lower and more normal levels. Underneath that full-year outlook, we expect the underlying combined ratio improvements to come in the second through fourth quarters of the year. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong returns and growth. Segment income of $220 million nearly doubled from the prior year quarter due primarily to higher underlying underwriting income and a higher level of net favorable prior year development. The improvement in underlying income reflects the impact of a single surety loss in the prior year quarter and higher business volumes. The underlying combined ratio was an excellent 78.1%. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 8%, driven by strong growth in our Management Liability business and solid surety production that was up slightly from the very strong prior year quarter. In our Domestic Management Liability business, our focus continues to be on retaining our high quality business and targeting rate were needed, while pursuing attractive new business opportunities. So we are pleased that retention remained very strong at 89% for the quarter with the renewal premium change of 3.9 points. New business of $53 million was up 8% from the prior year quarter. These results reflect our extensive competitive advantages and solid marketplace execution. We are a leading franchise in our specialty markets with long-term customer agent and broker relationships across a national footprint. We've got exceptional talent and specialized industry expertise, extensive data and advanced analytics. And while we have leading platforms and robust products, we continue to invest in strategic product, marketing and technology capabilities that will further extend our competitive advantages. So Bond & Specialty results were excellent. We continue to feel great about our growth, returns and the opportunities that our strong market positions and competitive advantages present for the future. In terms of our 2019 outlook as compared to 2018, we expect RPC for our Domestic Management Liability business to remain positive and broadly consistent and for the segment, the underlying combined ratio to be broadly consistent. For Surety, we expect 2019 net written premium to be slightly higher than it was in 2018. Due to the inherent lumpiness in surety production, going forward, we will no longer be including surety net written premium in our outlook disclosure. And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance for the quarter, segment income was $32 million, an improvement of $82 million over the prior year quarter and our combined ratio of 102.6% improved 6.1 points. The Lower combined ratio was driven by improved auto results, lower catastrophes and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. For the full-year, segment income of $297 million and a combined ratio of 100.6% are also better than the prior year, driven by the same factors I referenced for the quarter. Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full-year was 5% and 7%, respectively. Our premium growth helped us achieve a 30 basis point improvement in our expense ratio for the full-year. Agency Automobile delivered another impressive quarter with a combined ratio of 95.3%, down 7.7 points from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by a lower underlying combined ratio. Underlying margins continue to improve due to earned pricing exceeding loss trend and frequency remaining better-than-expected. These factors also resulted in favorable full-year loss adjustments in the quarter that further contributed to a better loss ratio than we would have expected. The quarter also benefited from higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher catastrophes. Recall that the prior year quarter included a benefit from the re-estimation of catastrophes including hurricane Harvey. Our full-year combined ratio for Agency Automobile of 94.2% was 10 points better than the prior year and returns were well within target on both an overall and an underlying basis. In light of these improvements, we continue to moderate renewal premium changes in this line as we seek to balance growth and profitability. In Agency Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 109.8% improved by more than 5 points, despite three significant catastrophes; The Camp and Woolsey wildfires in California and hurricane Michael. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was 72.5% or 2.3 points higher than the prior year quarter driven by continued elevation in non-weather-related losses, which we noted in the prior quarter. The full-year combined ratio of 105.6% reflects the second consecutive year of very high catastrophe losses, which again accounted for approximately 24 points of the combined ratio. The full-year 2018 underlying combined ratio was 81.6%, 4.5 points higher than 2017 driven by higher levels of non-catastrophe weather and non-weather loss activity. Consistent with comments we made earlier this year, given this recent catastrophe and the non-catastrophe loss experience, and our assumption that some of this elevated loss pressure will persist, we continue to implement granular pricing and underwriting actions to manage our exposure and improve results. Turning to quarterly production, our agency automobile retention remained at a solid 84%, while renewal premium change of 6.3% continue to moderate consistent with our objectives and new business was up 2% from the prior year quarter. In Agency Homeowners and Other, we remain pleased with our momentum. Renewal premium change was 3.9%, nearly a point higher than a year-ago. In addition, we delivered 6% growth in policies in force, and strong retention of 86% and a 17% increase in new business. Turning to our outlook for full-year 2019, we expect renewal premium changes for agency automobile to be positive, but lower compared to 2018, while renewal premium changes for Agency Homeowners and Other should be positive and higher compared to 2018. We expect the underlying combined ratio to be broadly consistent in Agency Automobile, Agency Homeowners and Other, and for the Personal Insurance segment compared to 2018. This underlying combined ratio outlook includes the impact of the catastrophe aggregate reinsurance treaty that Dan mentioned earlier. In the outlook section of our 10-K, we will provide some quarterly texture underneath our full-year underlying combined ratio expectations as quarter-to-quarter comparisons will likely vary throughout the year. All in for the segment, in light of the improved results in auto and the actions we're undertaking in Homeowners, we are pleased with our position and with the opportunity to profitably grow the business, while continuing to invest in new capabilities and explore innovative opportunities in an ever-changing marketplace. With that, I will turn the call back over Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you, Michael. And with that, we\u2019re ready to open-up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJay Gelb: Thank you. First I wanted to touch based on the California wildfires. Can you give us some more perspective on how you compare your 2018 exposure to 2017 and whether you feel theirs is still type of public policy solution that needs to be addressed here given the annual major exposure for the industry?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Michael, you want to start?\nMichael Klein: Yes, I mean, I will start with just sort of the view of the exposure and Jay may be give you a little bit of a view into a little more detail underneath what we\u2019d mean when we talk about granular underwriting and pricing actions in response. So as we look at California wildfire, it's clearly two significant years in a row of losses I think, the discussion and the debate about the environment is pretty broad and pretty public. In terms of our response, we look at a handful of things. First, we look at our underwriting appetite and our view on terms and conditions in the marketplace and we have taken action. We had already taken action in 2017 to begin to restrict our new business underwriting appetite. We've implemented further action that will take effect later on this quarter in 2018 to further restrict that new business underwriting appetite and also to instill new business underwriting procedures for example further inspections around defensible space as an example that will again sort of tighten our new business underwriting appetite. We've also discussed with the Department of Insurance in California and begun to implement some nonrenewal action in the State of California to address some of the more significant wildfire exposures in the portfolio. And we\u2019re also in discussions with the department about a filing to increase prices for homeowners in California. So that gives you a little bit of texture underneath our response to wildfires in particular in the homeowners book.\nJay Gelb: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. My second question was on the pace of share buybacks in the quarter. So if I look back over the past six quarters, the average quarterly buyback is around $385 million, which was much higher than the $170 million in the fourth quarter. So, I'm just trying to figure out if fourth quarter lower pace of buybacks was due to the elevated CAT losses, or if there's some other factors going on that we should take into account when we project buybacks in the years ahead?\nDan Frey: Yes, Jay, it's Dan. I will take that. So really no change in our underlying philosophy. It's a consistent approach to capital management and to look at any one quarters worth of buybacks is probably a difficult way to look at it we think about it more over time as you would -- as you suggested and it would be true in the fourth quarter given the magnitude and the uncertainty related to the California wildfires, we did pull back a little bit on this level of share repurchase. But if you look at 2018 as a whole, we generated $2.4 billion of core income, we returned a little bit more than $2.1 billion through dividend and share buybacks and remember we made an additional $200 million contribution of the pension plan at the end of the third quarter. So really no change there. We are going to look at what level of capital we think we need to support the business, our projected levels of earnings going forward and the cash needs that we have for things like the pension plan and react accordingly. So what we buyback in shares is going to be an outcome of those things not really an objective of in and itself.\nJay Gelb: Makes a lot of sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Good morning. My first question just going to the business insurance, the underlying margin outlook for 2019. So if I go through some of your prepared remarks, you guys pointed to about 1 point above normal level of large losses in '18 with an offset partially there from that coming back of the additional aggregate reinsurance cover that you guys are purchasing. Now I know that\u2019s 50 basis points overall, I\u2019m not sure if you can go into the specific details within business insurance as we think about the margin improvement this coming year. And then as you set the margin outlook, are you guys assuming commercial auto gets better or worse when compared to how you guys ended up booking that business in accident year 2018?\nAlan Schnitzer: Elyse, good morning. It's Alan. So let me start and Greg you can jump in. So, we try not to get too quantitative on these outlooks. We try to keep it qualitative. There's a lot of estimates, a lot of judgments and a lot of things from period-to-period that are going to cause volatility. So we try to give you a order of magnitude and direction. Having said that, Greg did point out the -- essentially one point of property large losses that we would expect to return to more normal level. We do expect to address Commercial Auto over time, but a significant improvement in that is not otherwise reflected in the outlook for margins. And the overall impact of the new CAT Treaty on the BI underlying is relatively small. So I think in broad strokes that gives you sort of the way to think about the underlying outlook.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then my second question in terms of thinking about the pricing on outlook, you guys pointed to fairly stable renewal premium change this -- in 2019. So when you think about price versus exposure, can you give us a little bit of color of how you\u2019re seeing potentially picking up seeing the different components? And then in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s when we kind of annualize really the uptick in rates that we saw in 2017 following on the record CAT losses, did you see anything different in the market as we started to annualize some of that price that would be needed to think maybe the push for price will go one way or the other in 2019?\nAlan Schnitzer: You know between the CAT activity, Elyse, and one reinsurance renewals, we will all see together over time how that pricing plays out. We are not going to get anymore granular on the outlook than what we have in the outlook section that will be in the 10-K and that Greg shared. Overall, I would say that about 5 points of rate changes -- of price changes is pretty good change, if you look back at just the history of price change in BI a plus 5 would be in that historical context pretty good. And we've seen relatively stable allocation of that between exposure and rate. And so we feel pretty good about that overall.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, thanks. First question regards to the expense ratio improvement story. Would you say this is -- this will be -- is this in its early innings and could this be kind of a multiyear trend? It seems to have picked up in the second half of the year in terms of the improvement?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, what\u2019s definitely ongoing for us is the thoughtful and disciplined management of both productivity and efficiency as a strategic effort, and that goes across the entire company everything we do. So you will see more activity from us in that regard. In terms of how it's going to come through in the numbers, you may or may not see that in the expense ratio. We\u2019ve been saying for a while that our objective here is to create incremental operating leverage and we think that's very helpful to us, but really in the sense that it gives us a lot of flexibility. We can let that fall to the bottom line in the form of a lower expense ratio. We can take those savings and reinvest it into important strategic initiatives or we can decide to put it into price without compromising our return objective. So it's definitely an ongoing objective for us across the company. I think Greg gave you a sense of what a run rate is for BI and I don\u2019t know, you want to -- Dan?\nDan Frey: Yes, and for the enterprise I'd say similarly if you look at the full-year expense ratio, that's a pretty good indication of where we\u2019re probably heading going forward. It has improved quite a bit over the last couple of years. I think we\u2019ve reached a level that we're more happy with. As Alan said, we will continue to focus on productivity and efficiency, but I wouldn't expect to see a continued level of dramatic decrease in the expense ratio from the levels we\u2019re at now.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay, great. And my last follow-up question is in regards to worker's comp were margins remain healthy. If we think about work comp pricing, does that expected to become more or less of a headwind as 2019 progresses? And then maybe you could also update us on loss costs trends in comp? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, workers' comp it's been under some pricing pressure, but completely rational of given where the profitability of the line has been. We are not going to breakout pricing outlook by line. We give it you for the segment, but the profitability continues to be good. And generally speaking, we would expect continued pressure in the comp line. We\u2019ve got no change in commentary on workers' comp loss trend from what we shared with you last quarter, which is to say that we -- frequency and severity are -- those are selections, those are picks for us that go into loss ratios. And then data comes in over time and you look at reported activity over time and we compare that to what your selections are and decide if there's anything you're seeing that requires you to move off that. And as we shared last quarter and we would reiterate again, we're not seeing anything in the data that causes us to move off our loss picks.\nMichael Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKai Pan: Thank you and good morning. My first question on these sort of new aggregate reinsurance program. So how much your CAT loss would be in 2017 to '18, if these program is applied retroactively?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Kai. So we looked at modeling what things would look like going back a number of years and in particular over the last two years, probably not surprisingly given the elevated level of CATs, we'd have seen a full recovery under the treaty in each of the last two years.\nKai Pan: Is that -- so is it safe to assume like your core loss ratio will be 50 basis points higher given -- aggregate cover, but your normalized CAT loss would be 50 basis point lower going forward?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, I wouldn\u2019t say that it's an exact offset. I think if you go back to my comments, it's definitely about a half a point on the underlying combined ratio with the mitigating factor on the overall normal CAT expectation to get us back to pretty de minimis impact on the combined ratio all in, if we had a normal year of CATs which as you know in the last seven years we haven't.\nKai Pan: Okay. In other word, if the CATs we see are coming lighter than your normal, you actually -- the lost combined ratio will be worse than in the normal year?\nAlan Schnitzer: The combined ratio would be worse because we would have exceeded a way premiums and had no recovery, correct.\nKai Pan: Okay, great. My second question on personal line side. And your prior guidance for 2019 was improvements in the underlying margin in both homeowners as well as auto book. Michael just gave like guidance for 2000 -- new guide in 2019, pretty much consistent with 2018. Is that because 2018 actually improved better than you were previously expected, or you are reinvesting in the business for growth?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Kai. It's Michael. I think it's -- so it's actually a little bit of both, right. If you think about auto, auto came in better than we expected and so the broadly consistent outlook just reflects the update of the actual results compared to the outlook. On the property side, it's a little bit of a change in the outlook. Again, we've been talking about catastrophes and non-catastrophe weather and non-weather loss experience and talking about the fact that we continue to put more weight on more recent periods as Dan mentioned. And so the broadly consistent outlook for property is partly a reflection of that as well as the impact of the accounting of the new CAT ag treaty, which as Dan just talked about is a drag on underlying and, in particular, impacts the property line. So those are kind of the pieces.\nKai Pan: Okay, great. Well, thank you so much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks and good morning. Maybe just a couple of quick questions for Michael Klein. Number one, if you go back, I guess, to Allen's opening remarks, it seems like a lot of the work which was needed in Personal Auto has been done and I think here the comment was that we got their ahead of expectations. Maybe just update us on the loss cost trend environment out there and maybe the trajectory of rate filings?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Amit. So I think loss cost trend fairly consistent with what we've talked about, right? We see continued severity trend particularly in collision and physical damage, increased cost to repair vehicles, and again, many of those dynamics we see has been relatively consistent with what we would've talked about a quarter ago. There has been some commentary about a little bit less pressure on bodily injury lost cost trend in the environment. Again, I think when you put it all together and combine it with our view on frequency, I'd say it's consistent with Alan's comments earlier of we have a pick, we observe results and we sort of see most of that as variation around the loss cost trend we've estimated and so don't see a significant change in our loss trend outlook there. In terms of outlook for price change going forward, again, our RPC outlook for auto is that RPC will remain positive, but be lower in 2019 than it was in 2018.\nAmit Kumar: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. The only other question I had was on the press release on lift. And I think lift has $1.4 million or so drivers. And I was curious if you could just maybe broadly talk about this opportunity, how we should -- we as outsiders should sort of handicap this going forward? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Amit, on lift we think it's an exciting opportunity for us to participate in the changing economy. It's a service offering for them. We wouldn't expect from an economic perspective for it to meaningfully move the numbers in the near-term, but it's a great partner and we're excited to work with them and excited to bring our leading claim capabilities to benefit for them.\nAmit Kumar: And any thoughts on expanding into another TNCs down the road?\nAlan Schnitzer: I don't -- we don\u2019t have anything to announce at the moment. We are always thinking about whether there are opportunities for us to participate in an evolving economy and we will continue to do that as we think about innovation and what insurance means in the changing world.\nAmit Kumar: Got it. I will stop here. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you. First, just going back to the CAT loads or the CAT treaty that Tom was talking about. Is it a simple way to think about this kind of going forward, so we kind of assume a $1.3 billion CAT load for you guys? Is that kind of a good way to think about it?\nDan Frey: Brian, it's Dan. So I will say we don\u2019t give earnings guidance and so we won't give guidance on the specific pieces of the components that go into earnings. You could see historically we will disclose from time to time in the proxy what our expected level of catastrophes had been on sort of a backwards looking basis. We should take that number and probably think about it trending up over time for two reasons. One is we\u2019ve seen growth in the premium volume in the overall exposure level in the business, and two, as we mentioned in my comments, a little bit more weight on recent periods that gives us a bit of an uptick in terms of our view of each dollar of those premiums that would need to go into CAT. But I'm going to avoid given a specific number.\nBrian Meredith: Got you. Great. And then my second question, I\u2019m just curious, you guys had really good strong growth, new business growth in your Select business, small commercial. I\u2019m just curious, does that have any pressure on your underlying loss ratios when you're seeing that type of new business growth?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Hey, Brian. This is Greg. Yes, in the Select business you can see the 11% new business growth year-over-year. We feel terrific about that growth. We've been spending quite a bit of investment in the technology in the workflow and the product management across all of the Select business. You can see that the quality of the book looks really good, really strong retentions in the 82, 83 range. So we haven't seen any meaningful deterioration in the underlying based on that new business.\nBrian Meredith: Great. So it's really like in auto you'll see that 10 year impact, you don\u2019t get that in the small commercial?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Not as much just because you have the comp, you have the property, the GL and auto and [technical difficulty].\nBrian Meredith: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Great. Thanks. Good morning. First question just for Alan. Looking at the 95.7 underlying combined ratio in business insurance, we factor in some elevated large loss activity, but then you throw in kind of a normal CAT load and 3 to 3.5 point range. It feels like we are running at a normalized level here at like 98%, which is only a 2% underwriting margin. That doesn\u2019t feel like a double-digit ROE. I\u2019m curious is this a level on the combined ratio where you'd be looking at kind of hold the line, if there's a place you should be thinking about -- little bit more of a sense of urgency around rate increases. Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Ryan, I\u2019m not going to get into calculating those returns with you, but I -- but -- and clearly there's been some headwinds in pockets of BI, right. We talked about the commercial auto, we talked about large losses, we've -- Greg mentioned today some of the pressure outside the United States and the largest piece that come from Lloyd. So there are some aspects of that in which we would expect improvement over time, and we continue to get the 5 points of rate. So there are margin opportunities outside of the pure rate trend dynamic. Again, the BI large losses outside the U.S., commercial auto, that fixed income NII helps as those rates are where they are in the bond portfolio turns over. Again, you\u2019ve heard us talk about expense leverage, that's been pretty good. And just in terms of earnings dollars the volume helps us well. So we're not feeling badly at all about where the returns are on underlying basis and where they\u2019re trending. And if you take a step back and look at the whole company, Ryan, and -- you could do this math as well as we do, but if you take out prior year development and you put in wherever you think is normal for CATs, get a return that somewhere in the low double digits and given where the 10-year treasury is today. Again, that doesn't feel altogether bad to us, particularly with some opportunities we would see going forward and one of the benefits of having a company of this size is you got a diversified portfolio of businesses. So we always feel a sense of urgency around here. There's no question about that. We are at the heart of who we\u2019re optimizers and everything is not perfect, we\u2019re going to work with a sense of urgency to optimize it. But there's no sense at all here that that there are problems.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Ryan, one thing I would add. This is Greg, is when you do that math, keep in mind that we do have different combined ratio target, depending on what the net investment income is generated based on those product line. So think workers comp where we have the largest rate or we could run a higher combined ratio relative to a shorter tail line like property. So I would just ask you to keep that in mind also when you do that math.\nRyan Tunis: Understood. And then my follow-up is, I get the commercial auto to increase with the business is more lawyer involvement, but what\u2019s not completely clear to me as why that wouldn\u2019t translate this an elevated trend and the Other Liability line. So just curious what gives you guys comfort to do things you\u2019re seeing in auto or auto is specific and we shouldn\u2019t be seen more broadly general liability.\nDan Frey: Yes. So, Ryan, we certainly watch that carefully. And just walk you through the lines and our thinking on it. So you\u2019ve got GL large for a second, excess umbrella and I would put Management Liability in this group too. We already have very, very high levels of representation in those claims. So that's again already a high percentage RD pre-active there. On the smaller side, the GL small we are, we are seeing a little bit more of the attorney rep, but it doesn't seem to be quite as active as it is in the auto when -- we just speculate that's probably not as attractive of business opportunity for the plaintiffs bar, you've got a much more very portfolio of claims there, harder to make the case and many cases. So just -- it's just not as well hanging fruit at least for now. When you get into the really small when -- the liability component of CMP, again we have seen the pressure. This theme in other words does cross liability lines, but to a lesser degree than we see in auto.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Hi. Pardon me, I guess, is probably beating on a dead horse here, but when you discuss the impact on the core loss ratio from the commercial treaty that\u2019s completely separate from the one point of elevated large property losses. Do I have that right?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, two totally separate topics.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And second, the 50 basis point increase that you mentioned, that\u2019s not compared to 2018. That\u2019s compared to what 2019 would be otherwise, is that fair?\nAlan Schnitzer: It is compared to what 2019 would otherwise have been, correct.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open.\nLarry Greenberg: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just on investment income, wondering if there's anything to say about non-fixed income in the first quarter, given the volatility in equity markets and fixed income markets in the fourth quarter. And then, just given some of the spread widening that took place in the fourth quarter, have you done any asset reallocations given some of that volatility or what some might view as opportunity?\nWilliam Heyman: Hi, Larry. It's Bill Heyman. Let me take in reverse order. With respect to the second question, we haven't really changed our strategy, we regard increased spreads as you say is opportunity, assuming our credit judgment is good, which historically it has been. The -- as you know the yield on a 10-year treasury dropped from 3.06 at the end of the quarter to about 2.69 at the end of the year, its back up to about 2.75. So that's been partly compensated for by spread widening. So we are still pretty comfortable with what we're seeing out there. In returns of private equity, we occasionally make internal projections of what we think the portfolio will throw up and we've been notoriously inaccurate. We generally far too pessimistic. I agree that the developments in public equity markets in the fourth quarter taken alone wouldn\u2019t order well for 2019, but we've seen similar situations where developments like that have been followed by perfectly good years. So your guess is probably as good as ours.\nLarry Greenberg: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Your next question will come from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Thanks for allowing to sneak one in. As we go back to business insurance and the underlying combined ratio there, so I think you said that you had about a 1% point of non-CAT, large losses in '18. I think that was roughly the same number that you had in '17, so if I look at the underlying combined ratio, it seems like there was a little bit of deterioration year-over-year. Maybe if I adjust for the commercial auto, it's flat to slightly worse. Can you maybe talk about what is driving that this year and then what gives you lead confidence that 2019 numbers will look better.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Hey, Yaron, this is Greg. Number one, you\u2019re correct that we do our best job possible of trying to normalize our large losses, and that\u2019s how we price and managed the business and we were over expectations in 2017 and as I disclosed in my prepared comments we are also over our normal expectations for 2018. That was roughly the one point.\nYaron Kinar: The difference and maybe a point to the full-year underlying combined ratio where you can see an 80 basis points difference between those, the full-year '17 and the full year '18. Then again in my prepared comments I mentioned auto driving a little bit more than half a point there. The international businesses is also driving above a little more than half a point and that's predominantly driven based on the Lloyd's business. And then we had some as I disclosed some favorable expense activity that offset some of that. So those are all the pieces that get to there.\nGregory Toczydlowski: So if you expect the expense ratio may be not improved to the same magnitude in '19. Can you still expect some improvement in '19 for the overall underlying combined ratio. Can you maybe talk about where that improvement would be coming from, given the current loss terms?\nAlan Schnitzer: It's basically that one point of large losses.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. Okay. And then maybe a quick one on the prior year development. It sounds from the scripted comments that the slowdown in that prior year development, favorable development was really driven by an increase in adverse development and not so much by maybe a decrease in gross favorable development. Is that fair?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Let me just start and I will queue it. The question almost implied that there is a trend in prior year development. There is no trend in prior development. Our obligation at the end of every quarters to come up with management's best estimate and we do that, and then every quarter we go through the process of reevaluating our returns and making adjustments where we feel like we need to. So in any for any given period, the level of prior year development is just a net of those adjustments to best estimates.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, I would echo that which is why I think we\u2019re pretty careful to always characterized and as net favorable prior year reserve development are net unfavorable prior reserve development, because there are business lines in accident years that go both ways. And if you step back and look at the full-year, a little more than $0.5 billion of pre-tax net favorable prior year reserve development. Not that big in the scheme of the balance sheet, if you look at the right side of the balance sheet you\u2019re seeing loss and loss of adjustment expense reserves of around $50 billion. So we are pretty good at estimating losses, but every quarter we are going to update and refine them.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Goldstein for closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you all for joining us today. And always if you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to us in investor relationships and have a good day. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 18, 2018. At this time, I would like to turn your conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2018 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com, under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in our Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now, you've seen our numbers and we're pleased with the results. This morning we reported third quarter net income of $709 million or $2.62 per diluted share, generating return on equity of 12.6%. Core income was $687 million or $2.54 per diluted share. Our core return on equity of 12% was strong, particularly considering that while catastrophe and non-cat weather losses were significantly lower than last year's quarter. In the aggregate, they were nonetheless elevated relative to our expectation. Our performance this quarter is the result of excellent underwriting execution across a diverse portfolio of businesses, a successful and consistent investment strategy, and the continuation of our strategy of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Notably, our results this quarter benefited from record high net earned premium and the sub-30% consolidated expense ratio, reflecting progress that we're making on our strategic agenda. About a year ago, we explained that our strategic plans were largely geared toward creating top-line opportunities and that improving productivity and efficiency was an important component of our strategy. Each of our business segments has contributed on both counts. They've done so by successfully implementing technology workflow and product enhancements, and by making sure that we're delivering compelling value to our customers and distribution partners. Before I get further into the results, I want to acknowledge the devastation caused by hurricanes Florence and Michael. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been impacted. Following events like these, our claim organization works hard to make sure that our customers see the value of the promise they bought from us, and our agent and brokers see the value of the Travelers' promise they sold. Case in point, as of today, we've closed more than 90% of our homeowners' claims arising out of Hurricane Florence. And we're bringing the same level of urgency for our customers impacted by Hurricane Michael. We're thankful for the extraordinary effort by our claim professionals. Turning to production, we were pleased with the success of our marketplace execution. Growth in each segment contributed to consolidated net written premium growth of 6%. In domestic business insurance, retentions remain historical highs, which is a reflection of the fact we have a high quality book of business and the significant percentage of it is meeting our return expectations. Renewal premium change, including pure rate and exposure, is strong at around 5%, which is about 2 points higher than in the prior year quarter and stable sequentially. Inside that, pure rate is up about 1 point quarter-over-quarter and down a little sequentially. And economic activity is contributing to a healthy level of exposure growth. At this level, pricing is more or less offsetting loss trend, but as you know, we don't manage the headline number. There is a continuum of price change with workers' comp at the low-end and commercial auto at the high-end. In between, there are accounts, products and geographies, where we need more price and others where we don't. And we'll execute accordingly. In terms of pricing and profitability, there are a number of factors that impact our returns beyond rate and loss trend. First, we actively manage all the available levers, such as risk selection, mix of business, claim and expense initiatives, volume, reinsurance, and so on. Beyond that, there are a few environmental factors at play. A decade after the financial crisis, interest rates and as a result net investment income are moving higher. As I mentioned, economic activity is generating exposure growth. And thanks to tax reform, we're benefitting from a level playing field and a lower tax rate. We take all that into account in our pricing strategy to achieve our target returns. We follow the same approach across all of our businesses. Turning to Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 5% with strong production in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 6%, benefiting from continued successful execution in Agency Auto and [PIT] [ph] growth in Agency Homeowners. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael, about the segment results. Before I pass the microphone, I'd like to share a few thoughts about some of the investments we've made and are making. We've grown our top-line year to date by over $2 billion or 11% as compared to the same period in 2016. Over that same two-year period, we've managed G&A expenses to about flat. You've seen the impact in our expense ratio. In addition to a lot of hard work by the best field organization in the business, our ability to have done that has been enabled by significant investments in things like core technology and work flow. We've been making these investments over some time, while delivering leading returns and we continue to invest thoughtfully and strategically. As we shared with you before, in terms of innovation, we have three clear priorities: to extend our lead in risk expertise; provide great experiences for our customers, agents and brokers; and improve productivity and efficiency. We're encouraged by the progress we're making. As you've probably heard, we recently announced that we've teamed up with Amazon to launch an industry-first digital storefront. This initiative is designed to create new opportunities for us and our agents to attract and serve customers and help them take a more proactive approach to home safety in an increasingly digital world. It's obviously very early days, but overtime, we are hopeful that this and similar initiatives will lead to new business opportunities, improve loss costs and provide us with valuable insights. This past summer, we made a majority investment in Zensurance, a Toronto-based digital provider of online insurance solutions for small businesses. It's a natural fit with our Simply Business team, further adding to our digital capabilities and medium-term strategic positioning to serve the micro and small commercial customer. We also recently announced an investment in Kittyhawk, the market leader in enterprise drone operations software, further enhancing our position as an industry leader in the use of drone technology. In short, we believe the winners in our industry will be those with deep domain expertise, who can continue to deliver industry-leading results while innovating successfully on top of a foundation of excellence. Internally, we refer to it as our perform-and-transform mandate. From a position of strength, we believe that we have the talent, resources, expertise and focus to do just that. For the past 66 quarters, this is the point in the call that we pass the microphone to Jay Benet. Today, I'm pleased to be passing the microphone to Dan Frey, but before I do that, a word about Jay. It's hard to overstate the impact that Jay has had on Travelers. He is a big talent and virtually every milestone in the modern life of this company bears his marks. Having said that, this day was foreseeable and we were well prepared. And thankfully, we'll continue to benefit from Jay's experience and wisdom, so continue to serve on the senior leadership team as Vice Chairman. One of Jay's biggest achievements is having developed a world-class bench of finance talent including Dan Frey. Dan brings more than three decades of finance and accounting experience to the role. He served in the number of strategic financial management roles across Travelers over the past 15 years, most recently as the CFO of Personal Insurance. I couldn't be more pleased to have Dan as a partner. His deep technical expertise, strategic mindset and collaborative style make him the perfect fit to help lead Travelers into the future. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $687 million, up $434 million from the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 12%, up from 4.5%. The significant improvement in both measures from last year's third quarter resulted primarily from the lower level of weather-related losses and very strong net investment income. Our third quarter results include $264 million of pre-tax cat losses, a significant amount although well below the $700 million in the prior year quarter, accounting for 6.9 points of improvement in the combined ratio. Prior year reserve development was slightly favorable in comparable quarter-over-quarter. The consolidated underlying combined ratio was 93%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD remains steady. As a higher level of non-cat weather losses was mostly offset by the improvement in our expense ratio. Our pre-tax underlying - underwriting gain of $448 million remains steady, as increases in Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance were largely offset by results in Personal Insurance. Pre-tax net investment income increased by $58 million from the prior year quarter to $646 million, while after-tax NII increased by $90 million to $547 million. Both measures benefited from the more favorable interest rate environment and increase in average invested assets resulting from continued growth in net written premiums and favorable results in our non-fixed income portfolio. On an after-tax basis, NII also benefited from the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. As we had expected after-tax fixed income NII increased by $60 million, and we expect after-tax fixed income NII in the fourth quarter will increase by $60 million to $65 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 as net written premiums continue to grow and reinvestment rates are expected to exceed existing rates on upcoming maturities. Net favorable prior year reserve development of $14 million pre-tax or $10 million after-tax was comparable with the prior year quarter. On a year-to-basis, net favorable prior year reserve development was $350 million. Both Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance experienced net favorable PYD this quarter. Business Insurance experienced net unfavorable PYD driven by a $225 million increase to asbestos reserves along with $57 million increase to commercial auto reserves that resulted from elevated severity in recent accident years partially offset by favorability in the workers' compensation line. Excluding the asbestos charge, Business Insurance had $169 million of net favorable prior year reserve development. The asbestos reserve increase resulted from the completion of our annual asbestos review during the third quarter. The increase was driven by higher estimates of projected settlement and defense costs from mesothelioma claims compared to what we had previously expected. As has been the case in previous years while there was some slight improvement in several of our asbestos indicators, our expectation had been from more of an improvement. This phenomenon has continued to result in periodic reserve strengthening for us and for others in the industry. The numbers of deaths from mesothelioma, which we believe as a leading indicator of further asbestos payments has trended downwards somewhat during this decade. At the same time, the mix of mesothelioma deaths by age has shifted to older cohorts. That may be the result of medical advances over time successful treating a variety of other deadly diseases, allowing more people who work with asbestos when it was prevalent in the workplace prior to the late 1970s to live long enough to the develop mesothelioma in their 70s and 80s. Ultimately, this high-risk cohort will become smaller over time, so we continue to expect that the current claim environment will improve as time goes on. Bond & Specialties net favorable prior year reserve development of $53 million pre-tax was driven by domestic Management Liability, while in Personal Insurance, the net favorable PYD of $17 million pre-tax was driven by domestic personal auto. Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.7 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion. While, it was already overfunded, we made a discretionary contribution of $200 million to our qualified pension plan before we filed our 2017 tax return in September, which provided a 35% rather than a 21% tax benefit resulting in $28 million economic tax benefit in the third quarter. Recent increases in interest rates, which have benefited our fixed income NII have resulted in a modest net unrealized investment loss impacting shareholders' equity. As of September 30, we had an unrealized investment loss of $447 million after-tax. Remember the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio nor our business. We generally hold fixed investments to maturity, but quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have had little or no impact on our statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, is now $86.51, 4% higher than at the beginning of the year. We continue to generate excess capital, and accordingly returned $607 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter. Comprising share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $207 million. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned $1.76 billion of capital to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. While it obviously do not impact our third quarter results, I'd like to provide some commentary regarding Hurricane Michael. While much of the media focused on this storm has been on the devastation of homes in Florida, and our thoughts are with all those impacted, it's worth noting that this was a multiday event impacting both personal lines and commercial lines in a number of states. In addition to Florida, the PCS footprint also includes Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Given that, it's just a week or so since the storm hit, we are still assessing our view of losses from the event. At this point, we expect the losses from this storm to be significant. In terms of meeting the threshold for inclusion in the schedule of catastrophes in our quarterly SEC filings, but manageable relative to the fourth quarter overall and not something that would preclude us from resuming stock buybacks next week. And with that, I'll turn the microphone over to Greg.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced segment income of $410 million and a combined ratio of 100.6% for the quarter both significantly better than the prior year quarter due primarily to a significantly lower level of catastrophes this year. The unfavorable prior year reserve development that Dan mentioned had 1.5 point impact on the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 95.4% was 1 point better than the prior year quarter as non-cat property fire losses, which were elevated in the prior year, returned to more normal levels. Although, the underlying loss ratio improved from the prior year, it was impacted by about above 1 point from higher than expected non-cat weather. For perspective, the third quarter of 2018 included 18 PCS in equivalent events outside the U.S. that did not meet our cat threshold, while 2017 had only 6. While losses from non-cat weather were unfavorable to our expectation, cat losses were favorable. In the aggregate of the cat and non-cat weather was generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our expense ratio improved by around 0.5 point as we remain focused on managing expenses thoughtfully while making ongoing strategic investments and prudently growing the business. Turning to the top line, net written premiums were strong for the quarter at $3.6 billion, up 6% over the prior year quarter driven by strong production results. Regarding domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 5.1% with renewal rate change of 1.8%, while retention was exceptional at 86%. New business of $467 million was up 7% from a year-ago. Pure rate is up more than 1 point from the third quarter of 2017 and down a bit sequentially, but as you know, we executed a very granular level. We continue to achieve renewal rate gains broadly across our Middle Market accounts with auto, CMP, GL, property and umbrella all having positive rate increases. Auto continues to be the line with the highest level of rate consistent with our view of performance of the line. We're pleased with these production results in consistent with Alan's comment, we continue to execute our marketplace strategy to meet our return objective with thoughtful balance towards retaining our best business, improving pricing where it's needed and pursuing attractive new business opportunities. Turning to the individual businesses. In select, renewal premium change and renewal rate were stable, while retention remained strong at 83%. New business was 5% over the prior year quarter as we continue to leverage our investments in technology and workflow initiatives. In Middle Market, renewal premium change was 4.7% with renewal rate change of 1.6%, while retention remained historically high at 87%. New business premiums of $269 million were flat to the prior year quarter in aggregate. In our core commercial accounts business, where our business initiatives are most advanced, new business was up 5% as we continue to be more active in the market with increased quote activity. In closing, Alan laid out our innovation agenda across the company. As we shared with you at last year's Investor Day, for Business Insurance that means furthering our capabilities around customer solutions, convenient processes and competitive cost structure. Our strong marketplace execution including the impact from the progress we've made on the strategic initiative have contributed to our ability to deliver nearly $600 million of additional net written premium year-to-date in 2018, while keeping insurance G&A expenses generally flat. With that, I'll turn it over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty Insurance.\nThomas Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered strong returns in growth across the business. Segment income of $196 million was up $60 million from the prior year quarter due primarily to a higher level of favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio was an exceptional 78.3%. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 5% driven by broad growth across our businesses. These results reflect the impacts of strategic products, marketing and distribution initiatives to grow these profitable lines, including workflow enhancements to drive improved efficiency and productivity internally as well as for our agents and brokers. Advanced analytics leveraging our valuable proprietary in third party data to refine our marketing and underwriting strategies, and improvements in value added capabilities to further distinguish our product and service offerings in the marketplace. Turning to production. In our domestic Management Liability business, given the level of returns we are achieving we continue to execute our strategy to retain a substantial percentage of our high quality portfolio, while pursuing attractive new business. So we are pleased that the retention came in at a very strong 89% for the quarter with the renewal premium change of 3 points. New business was at a record level up 12% from the prior year quarter. So Bond & Specialty results were excellent and we continue to feel great about our execution in the marketplace, our growth in returns and the opportunities that are strong market position and competitive advantages present for the future. And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Tom. And good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance this quarter, we continue to deliver on our objectives of balancing growth and profitability in auto and sustaining momentum in homeowners. Segment income of $153 million, increased $76 million over the prior year, while their combined ratio of 97.2% improved 2.5 points. These improvements were primarily driven by lower catastrophe losses and a modest amount of favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by higher underlying loss experience, which I will discuss in more detail shortly. Agency Auto delivered a strong quarter, with a combined ratio of 91.3%, down 14.7 points from the prior year quarter. While the quarter benefited from 1.8 points in favorable reserve development, as well as 6.7 points from lower catastrophe losses, the main story is the continued improvement in underlying auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio improved over 6 points to 92.6%. Primarily as a result of the continued successful execution of our underwriting and pricing strategies, as well as frequency that was better than we expected. Taking our year-to-date underlying combined ratio for Agency Auto of 94.8% and factoring in our normal expectation for a seasonally higher fourth quarter combined ratio, we're on track to be within our targeted combined ratio range for the full year, which is sooner than we originally expected. In Agency Homeowners & Other, the third quarter combined ratio of 100.3% was impacted by a significant number of catastrophe and the non-catastrophe events. Catastrophes, including the Carr Wildfire and Hurricane Florence added 11 points to the combined ratio this quarter, a slight improvement relative to the third quarter of 2017. The high number of other PCS events that Greg mentioned, along with a variety of additional non-catastrophe weather events, accounted for roughly 6 points of the 10 point increase in the underlying combined ratio for the quarter. The remainder of the increase was largely attributable to non-weather loss activity, including elevated water and fire losses. As we indicated last quarter, we are actively factoring this more recent loss experience into our granular pricing and underwriting decisions. Renewal premium changes have increased year-over-year and we expect an acceleration in Homeowners' pricing in future quarters. Turning to the top-line, Agency Auto premiums grew 6%, driven primarily by price increases, which continue to moderate consistent with our plans and in line with improving profitability. In addition, we're pleased with the modest improvements in retention and a 2% increase in new business, the first year-over-year increase since the first quarter of 2017. In Agency Homeowners & Other, we remain pleased with our momentum, delivering 6% growth in both net written premiums, as well as policies in-force, while achieving renewal premium change of 3.8%. All in for the segment, results continue to improve and we're pleased with our progress in our plans to generate profitable growth going forward. As Alan mentioned, we're excited about our new relationship with Amazon, along with the other strategic initiatives we have underway, including the ongoing roll out of Quantum Home 2.0, further expansion of our IntelliDrive auto telematics program and continuing investments in digital capabilities that improve ease of doing business for our customers and agents, while making us more efficient and effective. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. We're ready to begin question-and-answers, please.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKai Pan: Thank you and good morning. First, best wishes for Jay for his retirement. And congrats to Dan on the new position. My first question is on non-cat losses. You have elevated non-cat losses for several quarters now. And so yet in your outlook, you expect them to normalize in 2019. So what give you confidence that recent experience will not be the new normal?\nAlan Schnitzer: I guess, Kai, when we're - the outlook section, Business Insurance, that underlying margin, I think as we reflect in those words, is a reflection of large losses returning to more normal levels by historical standards.\nKai Pan: So at what time - at what point, I'm wondering those recent experience will factor in into your outlook or normalized non-cat losses.\nAlan Schnitzer: Is that a PI comment, you're\u2026?\nDan Frey: Is that PI question, Kai?\nKai Pan: I think of probably for both, if you can comment on both PI as well as the BI.\nAlan Schnitzer: Kai, if we're talking about weather, this is the insurance business and there is going to be volatility in weather. And we acknowledge that we've had a run of quarters where we've had some variability in both cat and non-cat weathers. But if you go back and take the longer view, looking at cats and non-cat weather together, for the whole place, 2009 was better than we expected. We had a run from, I think it was 2010 to 2012 that was worse than we expected. At the end of 2012, we were thinking, gee, is this a new normal. And then, we went into a period of 2013 to 2015 that was favorable. 2016 was sort of spot on. And then, you got 2017, so far 2018 that has - that's been elevated. And so, we're - our objective is to get it right. Missing it too high is no better than missing it too low. Our objective is to get it right and make that we're pricing our product over time for what we expect on an overtime basis. And we think that we're effectively doing that. In terms of - if this is a question about modeling and you're trying to figure out how to think about your model for next year, we give you all the help we can in the outlook section of the 10-K and 10-Q. But thinking about this business on a longer term, we're taking all the data we have into account. We're thinking about everything we know about the future and making sure we're pricing our product for the long term.\nKai Pan: And so, you don't think sort of like is there a secular change in term of weather pattern that could change your expectations?\nAlan Schnitzer: Kai, I mean, I don't know whether you measure weather cycles by the year, by the decade or by the millennia. I mean, we know it's in our data and we can see that. And part of this isn't just weather. It's population migration into more wildfire and weather prone areas. And so, we take all of that, and all the history into account when we think about both our underwriting, our risk selection, geographically where we want to be, what kind of risks we want to write, terms and conditions, what our risk control people look for when they're going out, looking at the property to underwrite it. And we take it into account in pricing. But I'm - we're very interested in the question you ask, which is why off the top of my head I knew what weather had done going back almost a decade. And we follow it very carefully, and take all that into account when we're thinking about the future.\nKai Pan: Thank you very much for that. My second question on workers' compensation, some of your peers indicated there is a rising frequency trend in workers' comp claims. I just wonder if you could discuss your experience, as well as, as the pricing is going down, will you will be able to maintain the underlying margin in this line of business?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, Kai, so we've obviously followed all the chatter in worker's comp with great interest in - that's a business that we've historically been very good in. And we got a big set of data and we like that business a lot. But getting back to your question, let's - loss trend, frequency and severity, those are selections, right? Those are management estimates based on actuarial analysis of history and a view of expected trends. And that is a view that goes into both pricing and reserving. So you set up those expectations. And then you look at the data quarter by quarter as it comes in. And there are always ups and downs in the data every single quarter in virtually every product line. And so, you look at those ups and downs and you take a step back and you say, okay, what do we think caused those things to go up and down? Sometimes we know and sometimes we don't. And is that normal variability, normal volatility in that measure or is there something more fundamental going on that we expect to persist into the future? So particularly in a long tail line, you'd be pretty careful about making a dramatic change based on one quarter of data. So I'll tell you, we're watching it very closely. We do see ups and downs in these measures from time to time. We haven't seen anything year to date that's caused us to move off our loss picks. And, Kai, back to your other question, you asked - given pricing, will we be able to maintain returns in the product. If pricing is going down and everything else is equal - I mean, pricing is for sure an input into returns. If pricing is going down and everything else is equal, then the margins in the product will go down, that's just arithmetic. Pricing isn't the only factor. There is loss trend, as we just discussed. There is risk selection, there is claims handling. There are all the other levers that go into the return of a product. But your question, will rate - the decline in rate causes the return to go down, if that's the only thing that changes, yes. But that's not the only lever that there is. We're not going to get into a forecast of margins on a product-by-product basis.\nKai Pan: Great. I really appreciate all the answers.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Kai.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. I just had a - I guess in Business Insurance, the $160 million or so of total favorable development, I think, that's excluding the commercial auto, and excluding the asbestos. What's contributing to that? Is that basically entirely workers' comp or are there other liability lines that are also showing some redundancy?\nDan Frey: Hey, Ryan. It's Dan. So one clarification, so the $169 million was excluding asbestos only. So it is reduced by the commercial auto strengthening. Most of the driver of the remainder of the favorability in Business Insurance is coming from the worker's comp line, although there is some favorability in the other general liability once you exclude asbestos. But worker's comp, that's the big driver.\nRyan Tunis: Great. And I think probably from Michael. Just on the home results, I think you said elevated water and fire, it was 4 or 5 points of loss ratio deterioration. Just trying to understand like exactly what's going on there why that's a trend? Why that's something you think you need to price for? What's driving that? What could be driving that? Just trying to understand, what the loss trend is in the non-cat?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Ryan. Thanks for the question. And I'll just clarify it. So the 10-point deterioration in the quarter again roughly 6 points, roughly two-thirds of it, is coming from non-cat weather which includes PCS events that don't meet our threshold for a major cat as well as the other weather that I talked about. Your point about the other water losses and the fire again in the 10 points - the remainder of the 10 points was largely due to those. That's not 4 or 5 points. It's a smaller number than that, call it roughly a third. And it's about 50-50 non-weather water and fire inside that. I would say the fire experience is very much sort of normal period-to-period volatility. I think the non-weather water is something we've been watching, I think, you've heard others probably talk about non-weather water losses. We're digging into it, we haven't found smoking gun underneath it. But we have seen a deterioration in that experience and that is one of the underlying drivers that's causing us to rise price and expect an acceleration in homeowners RPC on a go-forward basis. Tying back to Alan's comments earlier on non-cat weather and underlying results, again you sort of look at - we look at all of that and our baking a portion of that into our outlook and into our underwriting and pricing strategies on a go-forward basis. So we are factoring in elevated loss levels that we've been seeing recently into our pricing and underwriting decisions and our pricing and underwriting strategy, which is again why you see our outlook for pricing to be higher.\nRyan Tunis: Got you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Yeah, thanks. Couple of quick questions here. First, I'm just curious, how are your interest rates, is that having impact on, kind of, how your pricing models are coming out at this point, any impact on it?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, I guess a couple of things on that. One, it's certainly an input into our pricing models, no question about that. It's hard to isolate, how any one factor is going to impact pricing, right? Yes. You start with - the return on the product when the policy renewals and then you put rate loss trend, interest rate assumptions, et cetera into it, and you come up with the price. But is that your question, Brian?\nBrian Meredith: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I'm just wondering, if some of the impact we're seeing maybe on your renewal rates has anything to do with just the higher interest rates going into your, kind of, calculation.\nAlan Schnitzer: I don't think so. First of all, because the duration of the assets, it's going to take a while for that to really ramp up and work its way in. And then, as the risk free rate goes up, our cost of equity goes up, and that's also an input into our pricing model. So I wouldn't say that the increase in interest rates is a dampener on price.\nBrian Meredith: Great. And just quickly on the Amazon, and I guess connected homes. I wonder if you could dive a little more into that? What do you think the kind of benefit you'll see from a loss trend perspective? Or is there some kind of metrics you could give us that when you got a connected home loss experience is supposed to be 20%, 15%, 30% better?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Brian. It's Michael. Thanks for the question. And again, it's - I would say, it's a long game we're playing here, and it's certainly something that we think will create opportunities for both us and our agents. We do believe that connected home devices should have a favorable impact on loss experience. It's very early days, we've not only been doing the work with Amazon, we've been connecting other experiments with other smart home device providers to try to quantify the benefits. What I can tell you is that we are filing to expand the discount for connected home devices in conjunction with this and the other work we've been doing, and moving that discount to about 5% as we roll the new Quantum Home product out across the country. So that's probably the best number I can give you to put a point on it. But again, it's early days and it's - we are very much looking forward to the teaming up with Amazon and to some of the other experiments to gain insights into the impact of these devices on loss experience.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Very helpful. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. I was hoping you give us a little bit more thoughts on the ultimate trend for the expense levels - expense ratios in both Business Insurance and Personal lines business? And just how far you think you can push that number around?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think, we're going to avoid that temptation to try to forecast the expense ratio. We give you all the outlook on margins in outlook sections that I think, we want to give. And I - but there's a really important strategic point here. Productivity and efficiency are very important initiatives around here, everybody is focused on it, but it's not necessarily for the purpose of just lowering the expense ratio. It's for the purpose of giving us flexibility from the financial perspective. We're trying to create flexibility to take that benefit and either let it fall to the bottom line, we can reinvest it in important strategic initiatives, where we can make a decision to put into price without compromising our return threshold. So while it's on everybody's mind here, and it's a big focus for us, it's not just about managing an expense ratio.\nPaul Newsome: Do you have a target or a goal in terms of the number of investments that you want to put in some of these, sort of, new insuretech-type businesses that you focus on this quarter?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. There is not a bogey that we would share from just competitive sensitivity perspective, we certainly think about the opportunity and what it's worth when we invest in these things. But we've made a deliberate decision so far not to set up a fund or allocate a certain amount of dollars to an initiative like that. We may change our mind. But at least our perspective now is, you do something like that and then you end up spending the money whether you find value in it or not. The fact of the matter is we generate a lot of excess capital. Our objective is to reinvest that money any time we can, when we think we can create shareholder value with it. So having said that, we are very, very disciplined about every dollar we spent and we put it up against a lot of metrics and measures to make sure we're getting that value out of it. But I wouldn't put a number or scope the opportunity.\nPaul Newsome: Thanks for the call.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks and good morning. Two quick - I guess, follow-up questions. The first question goes back to Kai's question on workers' compensation. Would it be possible maybe just talk a bit more about how should we be thinking about the pricing, because if you look at some of the pricing surveys, comp pricing is still in the negative territory, but coming back. And what would be really helpful is, just broadly, if you exclude workers' comp, how will the pricing look like?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, on workers' comp, I don't know if you're looking for forecast on pricing, where that's going obviously we're not going to get down to forecasting the pricing in a line. I mean, that's not much more competitively sensitive than that. But what I will say about pricing in the workers' comp, it's a reflection of a line of business that's been very profitable for us. So there's nothing about the pricing dynamics so far that's a surprise to us.\nAmit Kumar: Okay. The other question is a follow-up on the Amazon relationship. I was a bit surprised that it wasn't somewhat of an exclusive relationship and in the fine print it shows that's in four or five states and it's initially targeting, I guess, 15,000 customers who will get the free echo. Can you just talk about the trajectory? And did you try to be in exclusive relationship or not? Just give some background on that.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Sure, Amit. The 15,000 you referenced is a specific target of devices for the state of California only. And that's just the unique feature of the way we set the arrangement of in that state. To your point, just to give background for the rest of the group. The first four states - and this is really driven by regulatory filings and regulatory requirements. There was actually an endorsement of the policy that's required for us to be able to make the offer. And so we're essentially linking the Echo Dot offer and the discounts on the connected devices with that filing as we make it and get it approved across the country. So the first four states are just the initial four states, we plan to extended two additional states as we go-forward. And again, the 15,000 is just a number of devices specifically for California subject to the terms of the agreement with Amazon. As respect to your question about an exclusive, we're not going to comment sort of specifically about the details and the terms of the agreement beyond that. But again, I bring you back to - we're excited about this opportunity, we think it's a great opportunity for us. We are excited about the relationship with Amazon, and we're excited about the opportunity it presents for our agents and brokers to promote the program and how to sell these home safety solutions to our customers.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks for that color. I will stop here. Thanks.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nYaron Kinar: Good morning, everybody. First question, going back to the expense ratio. Just seems like a real step function improvement this quarter, I know, you've highlighted the expense management initiatives for a while and we've seen the earned premium growth as well. But I was just curious, if there was anything else specific this quarter that was driving this improvement, whether it was timing or other one-offs that helped the ratio here?\nAlan Schnitzer: No. There is nothing unusual underneath it. There is no timing or sort of onetime things that are artificially improving in it, a lot of hard work over a long period of time enabled by years of investments in technology and workflow that's enabled it.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And it just all came together this quarter, I guess?\nAlan Schnitzer: I mean, you've seen an expense number that's been flat over a pretty long period of time. And you've seen an expense ratio that's been on a decline. So I mean, it's sub-30. It's just as good a number as we've printed in a long time. But as we see it, the continuation of a trend.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. Fair enough. And then going back a second to non-cat weather specifically and BI. I noticed that you exited the - I think, the open market property in Lloyd's this quarter. Would that or should that have some positive impact on non-cat weather going forward, you think?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yeah, Yaron. This is Greg Toczydlowski. That's a real small portion of our overall Lloyd's book and hence it's a real small portion of our overall BI portfolio. So it really wouldn't have a material impact on the loads of the business going forward.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And would you be wanting to tell us what's the year-over-year change in non-cat weather was and BI?\nAlan Schnitzer: I don't think that's detail that we've given. We did tell you that non-cat weather and BI, I think, what Greg said was about a point relative to what we would have expected. Hopefully, that's useful color for you.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJosh Shanker: Yeah, thank you for taking my question, and good morning. Following up on Yaron's question, I might have it wrong in my notes. But I think in 3Q 2017 you said you had 200 to 250 basis points of manmade fire losses that were elevated in 3Q 2017, and now we have a 100 basis points of elevated non-cat weather. Maybe my numbers are wrong there. But if I strip those two items out, am I wrong to come to the conclusion that the underlying true-true underlying loss ratio in BI has deteriorated over the last 12 months?\nAlan Schnitzer: I mean, it's certainly worse by - I don't know exactly what your math was. But I don't know. There is another 50 basis points or something like that that we would just consider the normal variability in the insurance business. But I wouldn't consider it a structural - I mean, the word deterioration suggest the systemic structural deterioration. We wouldn't say that. We'd say there is another 50 basis points of just variability and this is the insurance business.\nJosh Shanker: Well, I mean, if I go back to like the 3Q 2017 10-Q, the projection was that margins would improve as I guess these items - I guess, am I - and my numbers - I guess, are my numbers right, there were 200 to 250 basis points of fire losses a year ago embedded in the numbers, is that still correct?\nAlan Schnitzer: That is correct.\nJosh Shanker: Okay. And then, I think we've been through it in the past, but I just want to go through it again. You got a very, very good quarter on alternative investments results. And in terms of when you record them, the limited purchase and whatnot, are they on a lag, are they in real-time? Can we just talk about how those are recorded and how we should think about that going forward?\nWilliam Heyman: Sure. It's Bill Heyman. Actually it's a mix. If a private equity fund sells a portfolio of company and distributes the proceeds within a quarter that comes into NII for this quarter. If at the end of the quarter, those proceeds are still in the fund, that doesn't come into NII, until we receive the financial statements from the fund. So if you carve-out distributions, and this year they've been responsible for the minority of private equity fund NII, there is a lag in terms of written up values. I know people ask us, maybe you to try to project. But with 75 sponsors, 200 funds and 3000 portfolio of companies, we probably couldn't come up with something that was even meaningful to us, much less something we ventured a share. So we probably can't offer much guidance on what the next quarter ought to look like.\nAlan Schnitzer: Hey, Josh, let me just go back to your question on BI underlying. And there is a - it seems implied to your question that you're looking at our outlook or explanation of prior periods and thinking about that as a forecast for a particular quarter. We are not giving the outlook information to try to give you guidance on any particular quarter. We're just trying to give as much help as we can on the general trends, as best as management can see it and interpret it and what those trends are and how they're influencing margins over the forward year. We identified the large losses last year, because that was an outlier. And in this quarter, it just so happens that those return to a more normal level - more normal level. But there are other factors that are going to impact this business from time to time. There is going to non-cat weather. We had that this quarter. We told you that was about 1 point. There are base year changes. There are premium adjustments. There are all sorts of things that in any particular quarter could impact the result. So I would just caution you, in terms of the way you use that outlook in terms of an expectation that it's guidance.\nJosh Shanker: So then, I mean, just that I want to get off to my next question. But do you feel that you're about - margins are about stable on where they were in your mind a year ago, generally trying to adjust for all these items?\nAlan Schnitzer: I mean, I don't think backwards. I think forwards. So we are where we are. We think there is an elevation of a 100 basis points of non-cat weather. And we've given you in the outlook as best we can where we think it's going to go.\nJosh Shanker: Well, good luck with the future. Thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.\nLarry Greenberg: Hi, thank you. And actually my questions have been answered. But just one other thought. And why not just use the PCS definition or allocation of catastrophe losses in your own cat definition, which, I don't know, might not do anything for you guys internally, but probably just would help with communication with the investment community and probably doesn't eliminate the non-cat discussion completely, but probably reduces a bit, any thoughts on that?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, it's certainly a topic that - yeah, sure, it's a topic that we certainly debate among ourselves all the time. We created the convention that we had, I don't know, probably in 2002 or something like that or maybe even before that. And the theory behind it was there is going to be some level of weather losses that ought to be stable and relatively predictable. And then you have things that are more severe that aren't. And obviously, particularly, more recently, we've seen a lot more volatility in that, call it, working layer of weather. So I don't know if we'll do it or if we won't do it. But we appreciate the comment and we have thought about it and continue to think about it from time to time.\nLarry Greenberg: Great. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Two quick questions. First, I guess, last quarter you talked about pricing within domestic BI excluding workers' compensation at 3.6 points. And I was wondering whether you could give us an update for the third quarter.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, we gave that last quarter. It was relevant. We hadn't intended to give it going forward. There is some competitive sensitivity to giving that on an ongoing basis. But having said that, and having given to you last quarter, I don't think we would intend to give it going forward. But I'll tell you, that also take down a few tenths of a point. But again, I'll point you back to the RPC of 5, which if you think about that 5 in a historical context that's a very strong number. And, well, I'm not going to quantify it. But the RPC ex-workers' comp is even higher than that, so hopefully a couple of helpful data-points.\nMeyer Shields: No, that is helpful. Second question, I was hoping you could dig a little bit into what observation drove the commercial auto reserve charge?\nAlan Schnitzer: As we indicated, it was severity in recent accident years. And we can speculate on some of what the causal factors might be and whether that's inexperienced drivers or higher density on the roads given the - I mean, we can give you some factors that we could all read about. I mean, the fact of the matter is it's hard to isolate it to one or two things that we can pull out of our data and say that it's this. It's a line that's been challenged from a profitability perspective for a while. We've known about that. We've been pricing for it. We've gotten, I don't know, over couple of years cumulatively 20 points or rate or something like that. So we're trying to get ahead of it. But it's hard to get to the causal factor. And if we can analogize to PI auto, we've seen some fluctuations in frequency and severity there. And sometimes those are explainable and sometimes they're not. We can speculate about some things. But I wouldn't know exactly what to point to, to tell you what it is.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, great. Thank so much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJay Cohen: Yes, thank you. Most of my questions are answered as well. I guess, just on the Amazon relationship, I mean, this is such a massive platform. And I know what you're talking about now is relatively modest for travelers. But was there any discussion around a broader product offering on their platform? Was auto thought about at all as far as being on that platform as well?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yeah, Jay, I think - again, I would stick with we're very excited about what we've done with Amazon, and not get into speculating on what other opportunities might exist there. We're really focused on making the most of the relationship we've established here, again, for us, for our customers. And importantly, because I - and I keep emphasizing this, because I think it's gotten lost a little bit in the rhetoric, but importantly, creating opportunities for our agents and brokers to take advantage of it with their customers as well.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, Jay, we love the question and we are very enthusiastic about it. I think we're a little bit hesitant to give any further insight into the way we're thinking about it strategically beyond what we've said.\nJay Cohen: Certainly shows you guys are being first movers in this, so it is pretty exciting.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question today comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I want to focus on personal auto for a minute. It feels like the year-to-date accident year combined ratio is kind of back where you want it to be. I don't know if you'd agree with that. I know you mentioned frequency was better than you expected. Maybe you could provide some color on whether it's kind of maybe back to its long-term negative trend and you are maybe being conservative. And then, along the same lines, I don't get the sense you guys are - are we going to start growing that line or - but maybe I'm wrong, because you've been growing homeowners at a nice clip, but auto is kind of been in a maintenance mode.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Sure, Mike. Thanks for the question. I think as we've been talking about the auto. The auto strategy at the top-level has shifted from reduced growth and manage profitability to balance growth and profitability. So we have shifted a bit in our mindset there. We are very pleased with the results year to date. And as I indicated, expect will be within our target combined ratio range for the year, which is ahead of schedule. Most of that is driven by the pricing and underwriting actions that we've taken. Some of it is driven by better-than-expected frequency that we've seen. I think for all the reasons that Alan just outlined in the commercial auto discussion, so that we're cautious about our outlook on frequency. But one of the drivers of the improvement has been frequency has been a bit better than we expected for a little while now. And so, we're cautiously factoring that experience into our outlook. And I would say cautiously optimistic. And again, you can see our outlook for pricing and for margins in the line in the outlook section as we spike it out there for you. But really pleased with where we are with auto and looking forward to taking it forward from here.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay, great. And one last follow-up on the fixed investment income guidance for 2019 and the outlook, it seems like it's about a 5% increase in the run rate. I know there is a lot of moving parts here. But premiums are growing mid-single-digits. Interest rates have moved higher. So just maybe there are some moving parts I'm not appreciating. It seems like it is conservative.\nDan Frey: I think - it's Dan. If you think - I think if you look at the run rate that we're on and the fact that the interest rate environment should continue to improve modestly. And we're modestly growing the level of premiums. I think that trajectory makes a pretty good amount of sense that fixed income portfolio is a fairly predictable number. We've been giving you that type of guidance for the last several quarters. And I think we've been coming in pretty close to that guidance.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, in the outlook section, I think we give you the driving factors. And we can take the - we can take it offline.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Right, [hope you'll get them out] [ph]. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Yeah, thank you very much for joining us this morning. And Investor Relations is available if you have any follow-up.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for attending today. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's call.

Welcome to the Second Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you\u2019ll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 19, 2018. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our second quarter 2018 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our Web site at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our Web site. And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $524 million and return on equity of 9.2%. Core income was $494 million generating a core ROE of 8.7%. These results were significantly impacted by an active tornado/hail season. Catastrophe losses of $488 million this quarter arose out of nine storms. To give you some context, that\u2019s around $50 million more than we would have expected. To put a finer point on it, losses from PCS defined catastrophes that don\u2019t hit our threshold to qualify as cat losses as we report them were about $25 million favorable to our expectation. So all-in, losses from PCS events were only about $25 million pre-tax more than we would have expected. That\u2019s well within the normal variability that we anticipate and price for. Having said that, this makes the recent series of quarters of catastrophe losses that have exceeded our historical experience and our expectation; tornado/hail, nor'easter, hurricanes, wildfires and mudslides. We haven\u2019t seen a string like that in the last decade. It also includes some unusual circumstances. For example, the California wildfires were historic and last year was the first time more than one category for hurricane has made landfall on the U.S. mainland in one season. In terms of creating shareholder value over time, we don\u2019t want to overreact anymore than we want to under-react. And when it comes to something as inherently unpredictable as weather, we take a balanced approach to developing conclusions from what takes place over a relatively short period of time. As always, the impact of weather on our business has our full attention and we\u2019ll continue to use our leading actuarial expertise in the latest in weather modeling to inform our underwriting and pricing decisions. In addition to the weather, the underlying results in Business Insurance include a small number of large commercial losses, primarily fire related, that exceeded our expectations by nearly a point on a consolidated combined ratio. We believe this is normal variability and large loss activity and Greg will share more detail on that with you shortly. Whether its weather or other large losses, there\u2019s no doubt that actual results are going to vary from our expectations sometime significantly. What\u2019s important in this business is that we have the data analytics and expertise to see and evaluate the trend so we can manage for success over time. We\u2019re confident that we do. On an underlying basis, the underwriting results benefitted from record earned premium. The underlying combined ratio of 93.6% was strong and consistent with the prior year. Underneath that, our businesses continue to perform well. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio of 96.5% was solid particularly in light of the large loss activity I just mentioned. Bond & Specialty Insurance produced another impressive quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 80.5%, a 1.5 improvement from a strong result in the prior year. In Personal Insurance, the underlying combined ratio improved about 2 points as a result of the successful execution of the pricing and underwriting actions we\u2019ve taken in our auto business. Our consolidated expense ratio improved by 40 basis points in the quarter and 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis, as we continue to benefit from expense discipline and strategic investments in technology and workflow to improve productivity. In terms of our investment results for the quarter, we were pleased that income from our fixed income portfolio was up, driven by higher short-term rates and a higher level of invested assets. Turning to production, we were very pleased with our continued successful execution in the marketplace. Net written premiums increased by 7% to a record $7.1 billion with each of our business segments contributing. As we saw this quarter and in recent quarters, we would expect underwriting results going forward to benefit from higher levels of earned premium. Once again, premium growth reflects to a large degree high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change. As I pointed out in the past that speaks to the quality of the business we\u2019re writing. In addition to that, we explained at our Investor Day last fall that the strategic investments we\u2019re making are designed in large part to create top line opportunities for us. The early success of some of those initiatives contributed to a healthy level of new business in the quarter. In Business Insurance, renewal premium change reached 5.3 points, its highest level since 2014 while retention remained at historically high levels. Excluding workers\u2019 comp, renewal rate change for domestic business insurance was 3.6 points compared to little less than a point in the same quarter last year. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, record retention, higher renewal premium change and higher new business led to a 6% increase management liability net written premium. Surety premium was up double digits. In Personal Insurance, as you know, we grew our PI Auto business considerably from late 2015 to the first part of 2017, including during a period of time in which the rate we were charging was not sufficient to cover an unexpected increase in bodily injury severity. We made the point at the time that the volume of business we wrote during that period would nonetheless be a positive contributor to economic value if we were able to keep that business and achieve rate adequacy. We have in fact been able to do that. Greg, Tom and Michael will provide more detail on production at the segment level. To sum it up, weather in large losses unfortunately color the quarter. As I said, it has our full attention. But looking at the quarter and looking forward, that doesn\u2019t define the strength of our business. We see that clearly in our underlying underwriting results and in our success in the marketplace. That is in part a reflection of the competitive advantages that we\u2019ve developed over decades and continue to serve us well and new capabilities we\u2019re developing to enable us to continue to lead in a rapidly changing world. We have and will continue to invest in our franchise by extending our lead and risk expertise, improving the experience for our customers, agents and brokers and enhancing productivity and efficiency. Combining that with our strong balance sheet, superior talent and capital management strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver industry leading results over time. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Alan. Core income was $494 million, down from $543 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 8.7%, down from 9.5%. As Alan indicated, these changes were not driven by fundamentals and our operating performance; rather they resulted from a pre-tax increase of $85 million in catastrophe losses, $488 million compared to $403 million in the prior year quarter and an incremental pre-tax charge of $45 million related to a few large commercial losses that were primarily fire related. PYD was also modestly lower, $186 million pre-tax compared to $203 million. Higher cats and lower PYD accounted for 1.3 of the 1.4 point increase in our consolidated combined ratio, 98.1% versus 96.7% in the prior year quarter. Our consolidated underlying combined ratio of 93.6% which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD remains steady changing by only one-tenth of a point as 1.7 point increase in BI\u2019s underlying combined ratio that primarily resulted from the fire related losses was almost entirely offset by improvements in both PI and Bonds & Specialty, 1.9 and 1.5 points, respectively, demonstrating the value of our diversified set of businesses. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $392 million increased by $19 million driven by increases in both PI and Bonds & Specialty. Greg, Tom and Michael will provide more details of our segment results shortly. Pre-tax net investment income remains strong, $595 million in the current quarter versus $598 million in the prior year quarter while after-tax NII increased from $468 million to $507 million due to the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate for all the tax exempt investment income. As with the first quarter, pre-tax fixed income NII of $510 million increased by $26 million compared to the prior year quarter driven by the more favorable interest rate environment particularly for short-term rates as well as an increase in average invested assets that resulted from recent growth in net written premiums. After-tax fixed income NII increased by $48 million and looking forward we expect after-tax fixed income NII for the remainder of 2018 will increase by approximately $55 million to $60 million in each of the third and fourth quarters compared to their corresponding quarters in 2017. Non-fixed income continues to perform well although not as well as in the prior year delivering $94 million of pre-tax NII. And overall, core income benefitted this quarter by $54 million due to the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Turning to reserve development and on a pre-tax basis, BI\u2019s current quarter net favorable development of 84 million was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic workers\u2019 comp partially offset by higher than expected experience in general liability for accident years 2008 and prior, including a $55 million increase in environmental reserves. Importantly, the current GL loss trend remained consistent with recent periods. Bonds & Specialty\u2019s net favorable development increased to $89 million driven by domestic management liability and PI had $13 million of net favorable reserve development driven by personal auto. Year-to-date, on a combined statutory Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all of our product lines in the aggregate and all of our product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had relatively small unfavorable development. Operating cash flows of over $1.1 billion were very, very strong. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.4 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. The recent run up in interest rate that\u2019s benefitted fixed income NII has for the first time in many years resulted in a small net unrealized investment loss that impacted shareholders\u2019 equity. After-tax net unrealized investment gains which were $1.1 billion at the beginning of the year and $133 million at the end of the first quarter moved to a net unrealized loss position of $112 million after-tax at the end of the quarter. This was the driver behind a 3% decrease in book value per share from $87.46 at the beginning of the year to $84.51 at the end of the current quarter. I\u2019d remind you the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses do not impact the manner in which we manage our investment portfolio or our business. We generally help fixed income investments to maturity, the quality remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on regulatory capital. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses is now $84.93 or 2% higher than the beginning of the year and 3% higher than the end of the second quarter of last year. We continue to generate excess capital and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy we returned almost $560 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising dividends of $209 million and share repurchases of $350 million. Year-to-date, we returned over $1.15 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Before turning the microphone over to Greg, I\u2019d point you to Page 19 of the webcast and provide a brief update on our catastrophe reinsurance program, the significant component of our overall reinsurance protection program. While the structure of our cat reinsurance is generally consistent with the prior year, we did take advantage of the current pricing environment to increase our cat bond limit by 200 million while reducing our Northeast Property Cat Excess-of-Loss Treaty limit by the same amount. A new $500 million reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re III has replaced the $300 million agreement that expired in May. The new agreement provides nor\u2019easter, hurricane, earthquake, severe thunderstorm and/or winter storm coverage for certain property losses on specified lines of business through May 24 of 2022. The attachment point and maximum limit will be reset annually. So through May 24 of 2019, the full $500 million limit is available after covered losses from a single occurrence reach $1.9 billion and until such covered losses reach a maximum of $2.4 billion. And effective July 1, we renewed our Northeast Property Cat Excess-of-Loss Treaty which now provides coverage of $600 million part of $850 million in excess of $2.25 billion. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage which also includes a description of our Gen Cat Aggregate Excess-of-Loss Treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our second quarter 10-Q which we filed earlier today and in our 10-K. So with that, let me now turn the microphone over to Greg.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Jay. Business Insurance produced segment income of $385 million and a combined ratio of 98.8% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 96.5% was 1.7 points higher than the prior year quarter driven in particular by non-cat property losses, mostly a small number of large fire acclaims that Alan and Jay mentioned. We reviewed every one of these claims looking for underlying trends and not seeing any correlation we view this activity as normal period-to-period variability. The underlying loss ratio was also impacted by the net impact of small amounts and movements with a number of usual things including non-cat weather, base year adjustments, earned pricing compared to loss trends as well as business mix. A couple of other points I\u2019ll make on the underlying results. First, we\u2019ve been discussing the impacts of earned pricing versus loss trends for some time now. We\u2019re now at a point where the higher levels of earned pricing about covered loss trends of the quarter. Secondly, we remain focused on managing expenses thoughtfully while making ongoing strategic investments and prudently growing the business. Our expense ratio improved by about 0.5 point for the quarter when adjusted for the industry-wide assessment from a Texas Windstorm Pool related to Hurricane Harvey. Turning to the top line, net written premiums were strong for the quarter at $3.8 billion, up 7% over the prior year quarter with domestic net written premiums up 6% driven by strong production results across virtually all of our businesses. Notably, Middle Market was up 9% due to the production results that I\u2019ll touch on in a moment. International net written premiums were up 6% excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Turning to domestic production, we achieved renewal rate change of 2.1 points and renewal premium change was 5.3 points, while retention remains strong at 85%. New business of $532 million was up 8% from a year ago. We\u2019re pleased with these production results particularly considering the pricing pressure in workers\u2019 comp associated with strong industry profitability. Outside of comp, we continue to achieve renewal rate gains broadly across the remaining portfolio. Auto continues to be the line with the highest level of rate while property increases continued to accelerate in the quarter. We continue to execute our pricing strategy on the account-by-account and class-by-class basis with thoughtful balance towards retaining our best business, improving pricing where it\u2019s needed and pursuing attractive new business opportunities. Our results for the quarter reflect our continued deliberate and successful execution in the marketplace. Turning to the individual businesses. In Select, renewal premium change was 4.8% while retention remained strong at 82%. New business was up 15% over the prior year quarter as we continue to leverage our investments in technology and workflow initiatives. We\u2019re pleased with the returns in this business and our strategic direction. In Middle Market, renewal premium change was 5.2 points with renewal rate change of 1.9, up from 1.6 in the first quarter and up by more than 1 point from a year ago while retention remains historically high at 88%. New business premium of $315 million were strong, up 6% from the prior year quarter. As Alan mentioned, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the impact our strategic initiatives are having on the business. So all-in for the segment, we continue to build momentum in the marketplace from our strategic initiatives and feel great about how we\u2019re positioned for the future. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom to talk about Bonds & Specialty Insurance.\nTom Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty\u2019s operating results were very strong with segment income of $204 million, up 41 million from the prior year quarter due to a higher level of favorable prior year development and higher earned premiums. The underlying combined ratio was also very strong at 80.5%, 1.5 points lower than the prior year quarter primarily reflecting improvements in the expense ratio also due to the higher level of earned premiums. As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 9%, driven by broad growth across our businesses. These results reflect the impacts of strategic product, marketing and distribution initiatives to grow these profitable lines and in the case of surety also reflect higher average bonded contract sizes and modestly increasing spending, in particular public sectors. Our growth in international was primarily driven by our UK management liability business. Turning to production in our domestic management liability business, given the level of returns we are achieving we continue to execute our strategy to retain a substantial percentage of our high quality portfolio while pursuing attractive new business. So we are pleased that retention again came in at a record of 89% for the quarter and that new business was strong, up 10% from the second quarter of last year. Renewal premium change of 3.4 points increased from the prior year quarter. So Bonds & Specialty results were excellent and we continue to feel great about our execution in the marketplace, our growth in returns and the opportunities that are strong market position and competitive advantages present for the future. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter results in Personal Insurance reflect an elevated level of catastrophe losses already mentioned by Alan and Jay. While we\u2019re disappointed with the resulting net loss for the quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with the underlying performance of both our agency auto and agency homeowners business. The second quarter results continue to confirm that we are delivering what we intended, a stable volume of auto business with improved profitability and a steadily growing volume of homeowners business with attractive long-term returns. Personal Insurance reported a quarterly loss for the segment of $17 million compared to income of $12 million in the prior year quarter. The overall combined ratio was up slightly to 104.9 from last year\u2019s 104.1 but the underlying combined ratio improved nearly 2 points as catastrophe losses accounted for more of the total combined ratio. The quarter also included a modest amount of favorable prior year reserve development which Jay described earlier. In agency auto, the combined ratio for the quarter was 95.4%, down 11 points from the prior year quarter due in part to nearly 3 points of favorable prior year development and 1 point less of cat losses. The underlying combined ratio was also much improved, down nearly 7 points to 95.5% as a result of earned rate exceeding loss trend and more of a 9 [ph] loss environment. Stepping back to look at agency auto overall, we\u2019re very pleased to see premium growth for the year-to-date of 9% with the combined ratio on both the total and an underlying basis below 96. Normal seasonality will most likely result in combined ratios higher than this for the full year but we\u2019re pleased with the trajectory of this business and remain on track to deliver target returns over time. In agency homeowners, the second quarter combined ratio of 113.6% includes 26.2 points of catastrophe losses related to the wind and hail activity Alan mentioned. And the underlying combined ratio of 85.2 included about 1 point of impact from the Texas Windstorm assessment that Greg described. Catastrophe losses for the quarter were above both last year\u2019s elevated levels and above our expectations with the late May event in the Northeast and the late June Colorado storm being the most significant for us. Given the magnitude of these losses and what is now a series of quarters in which catastrophe losses have exceeded expectations, a few comments are warranted here regarding our analysis of these results. In the quarter, the primary driver of the elevated cat losses is the nature of the events, their frequency, severity and location including the localized impact that is characteristic of tornados and hailstorms. As Alan mentioned, as we look at this quarter and our experience over recent quarters, we\u2019re factoring it into our pricing and underwriting decisions. As you will note in our outlook, we expect renewal premium changes for homeowners to be slightly higher over the next four quarters than the comparable periods in 2017 and '18. Turning to the top line, agency auto premiums once again grew by 9% driven primarily by price increases as the volume of policies in force stayed broadly flat. We\u2019re pleased to see retention holding steady as we continue to achieve renewal premium change in excess of loss trends. Although by design the pace of price increases is trending down from the peaks we reached in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. In agency homeowners and other, premium growth for the quarter accelerated slightly to 6% with continued increases in both the numbers of policies in force and renewal premium change. Retention held steady at a very strong 86%. The rollout of Quantum Home 2.0 continued with another four states during the second quarter. Another six states will launch next month. As we\u2019ve stated in the past, the introduction of this new product will contribute to sustainable momentum and we continue to be encouraged that its flexibility, sophistication and ease of use are being well received by our agents and customers. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael. And we\u2019re ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJay Gelb: Thank you. My first question is on the investment portfolio. Given the effect of the lower tax rate for corporations, I was hoping you can just update us on your views in terms of whether Travelers might consider reducing its major allocation to municipal fixed income investments in the fixed income portfolio?\nAlan Schnitzer: Good morning, Jay. It\u2019s Alan. I\u2019m going to ask Dave Rowland to answer that question.\nDavid Rowland: Sure. Thanks, Alan. We have not really seen a reason to change our strategy overall. We continue to find relative value at points on the curve where municipals are more attractive to us on a risk adjusted after-tax return basis. And so we continue to buy municipals and plan to do so in the future.\nJay Gelb: Okay, thank you. And then my next question is on the recent news with Johnson & Johnson and their emerging asbestos exposure around talc. Just last week they had a $4.7 billion legal judgment against them tied to asbestos. So I was wondering if you can give your broad thoughts on that issue as it relates to talc and J&J and whether Travelers might have exposure there. Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure, Jay. Thanks for the question. As you can imagine we\u2019re always following all of the emerging issues and talc has been on our list of issues to follow for a long time. We don\u2019t comment on any individual insurers. That wouldn\u2019t be appropriate. But we will say as it relates to that issue and virtually any other issue \u2013 maybe not even virtually just every other issue, all the news is in the public domain and all the news that we\u2019re aware of in the public domain or not is reflected in our thought process that goes into reserve. So I think I\u2019ll leave that there.\nJay Gelb: I appreciate it. Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from B. Riley FBR. Please go ahead.\nRandy Binner: Hi. I had a question just on top line, which was good in the quarter. I think there were some comments on it in your opening remarks and script. But I just like to understand better if this better net premium written growth is a reflection of a better economic activity or if you feel that you\u2019re capturing share from competitors? And if it\u2019s the latter, just kind of elaborate on what the market dynamic is there?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Randy, it\u2019s a broad question because I think you got to sort of almost look at it business-by-business across the place. You can definitely see in the exposure numbers that it\u2019s at a healthier clip than recent periods this quarter and we do look at that and there\u2019s nothing really unusual going on underneath. So we do attribute that to economic activity. But there are others strategic things going on in the business that we think are driving premium growth. So we\u2019ve spent some time at Investor Day talking to you about the things that Greg and his team are doing in Business Insurance. All designs create top line opportunities for us with no change in appetite, no change in approach to risk but just the value proposition that we offer to our agents, brokers and customers. And it\u2019s still reasonably early days but the traction has been good and that\u2019s reflected in the new business numbers you see Middle Market there. And I\u2019d say the same thing for Tom\u2019s business, a lot of strategic things underway. I think he also talked about most of them at the Investor Day last fall and we think that\u2019s making a difference. Are these seismic changes in market share, I doubt it, but I think it is contributing to really healthy production and really healthy earned premium results.\nRandy Binner: And I guess the follow up there is \u2013 and we\u2019ll see how this develops over the earnings season. But these are \u2013 you\u2019re a very large market and these are large gains. And I\u2019m thinking more in Business Insurance in Slide 9 in particular in the slide deck. Is it \u2013 it seems like it\u2019s a combination of things. I appreciate that answer. But is there a market out there? Is there another competitor who is backing away from key lines where you\u2019re focused on, or is it really just an even mix of all the things you talked about?\nAlan Schnitzer: Randy, I think it\u2019s an even mix. And let me just reiterate something that I said in my prepared remarks which is when we look at the change in written premium quarter-to-quarter, for example, there\u2019s a large part of that that\u2019s coming from retained dollars. So that\u2019s an equivalent retention rate on a higher base of expiring premium and rate. And so we view that as a very positive thing and a reflection of a lot of hustle by a terrific field organization and great data and analytics at the point of sale. But we think that really speaks to the quality of the business that we\u2019re putting on. And again the fact that we\u2019ve got no change in appetite, no change in our approach to risk just really solid execution again account-by-account basis whether that\u2019s on a retained basis or a new basis. There is some exposure in that 5.3 points of price and again we do think that\u2019s a function of economic activity and there\u2019s some rate in there. So I think in terms of what we\u2019re doing in the marketplace production top line, Randy, we free great about it and firing all on cylinders.\nRandy Binner: All right, great. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Good morning. My first question, in the 10-Q in your outlook you guys pointed at the potential for the imposition of tariffs and other barriers to international trade could potentially lead to higher than expected levels of inflation. Alan, if you could expand upon that comment? What lines you potentially see being impacted over what timeframe and how that translates into your margin outlook for your businesses?\nAlan Schnitzer: Good morning, Elyse. Thanks for the question. Obviously, tariffs in conversation about trade generally is in the news and it\u2019s completely appropriate to point it out. Tariffs presumably would impact the inputs that go into loss cost as are a lot of things, by the way, that impact the way we think about loss cost. I think generally we would look at that as affecting short-term lines and things that we could react to. So we don\u2019t look at it. There\u2019s no sort of outsized expectations here but we\u2019re watching it. There\u2019s a lot of rhetoric out there, so we\u2019re just anticipating what could happen. I think the important takeaways are largely affect short term lines and we can react to it. And you and anybody can have a view on what those tariffs are likely to do to economic activity which we think has as much leverage for us positively or negatively as on the inflation side of things. So that\u2019s the way I think about tariffs at least.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. And then my second question, the renewal rate change if we back out comp was about 3.6% in the quarter, up about 30 basis points sequentially, so obviously a little bit of a slowdown quarter-over-quarter than we saw last quarter. Can you just comment on how you expect the rating environment to continue from here maybe by line, getting a lot of rate and commercial, auto and property but how do you see all that coming together and do you expect next quarter will the number be higher than 3.6%? And then also as we think about getting into 2019 just how do you see those numbers progressing from here?\nAlan Schnitzer: Elyse, as always, we give you some texture on outlook in the 10-Q for renewal price change and so we\u2019re probably not going to get more granular than that. There\u2019s not much more competitively sensitive than our pricing strategies. I\u2019ll make some observations though. We do see a steady trend over the course of the year actually probably going back to beginning of 2017, we feel pretty good about that. The breadth of where we\u2019re getting the rate gains continues to widen. We think that\u2019s a good thing. Retention hasn\u2019t shown any stress at all at where we are in the mid to high-80s, we got a long way to go before we\u2019d feel like we were sacrificing retention. But we haven\u2019t. Retention has held up. And so we feel pretty good about it. We are not \u2013 as I always remind you, we\u2019re not executing for a headline number. We\u2019re executing one account at a time to achieve a targeted return on that account and on our portfolio. So all-in-all, we feel pretty good about that. So maybe I\u2019ll leave it there and happy to respond to a follow up if you have.\nElyse Greenspan: No, that\u2019s helpful but just one point of clarification. In Business Insurance, did I hear the comment correctly that you guys are insinuating that earned prices is covering trend or it\u2019s just at those lines getting the highest level of rate?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think what Greg\u2019s comment was is that and this is for all of BI that earned pricing is about covering loss trend. And so we\u2019ve had a bunch of quarters in a row where we\u2019ve told you that loss trend outpacing pricing has been a contributor to the underlying combined ratio. This is the first quarter probably in a while we haven\u2019t mentioned that because the impact really is quite small. And that\u2019s on an earned basis not a written basis. Obviously written basis would be more favorable.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKai Pan: Thank you and good morning. My first question is on the BI underlying combined ratio deterioration under 70 basis points year-over-year. If you take out sort of like a $45 million of large commercial fire losses as well as the $9 million of assessment from the Texas Wind pool, that\u2019s about 1.5 points. So effectively you\u2019re flat year-over-year. I remember last year second quarter you had a higher basically elevated level of non-cat weather losses. I just wondered can you quantify this quarter\u2019s non-cat weather losses relatively to both last year second quarter as well as your historical average.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hi, Kai. This is Greg. Yes, we tried to give you all the pieces there so you could do the math on that. On the combined ratios we said the large losses were running just over the 100 basis points [indiscernible] that got to the 30 basis points. And so the gap that\u2019s in the remainder is the normal margin of variability that we would expect from quarter-to-quarter. So we tried to give you all the pieces on that so you could project that going forward.\nAlan Schnitzer: So, Kai, Greg mentioned a bunch of the sort of smaller items that \u2013 those things move around every quarter. They\u2019re not predictable. And we try to do our best to give you a sense in the outlook section as good as we can but there\u2019s obviously a lot of estimation in that. And obviously whether it\u2019s base year or small weather or whatever, those things are going to move a little bit in positives and negatives and you tally them up and there\u2019s a net impact. But it\u2019s that kind of thing.\nKai Pan: So your outlook suggest that second quarter non-cat weather loss is larger or higher than the normalized levels?\nAlan Schnitzer: Say that again, Kai?\nKai Pan: So your outlook said the second half assuming a more normalized non-cat weather losses which means the second quarter this year actually have higher non-cat losses?\nAlan Schnitzer: If I understand the question right, Kai, in Business Insurance if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking, non-cat weather was \u2013 are you talking quarter-over-quarter relative to our expectations?\nKai Pan: Relative to your expectations.\nAlan Schnitzer: It was slightly favorable in Business Insurance this quarter.\nJay Benet: Kai, this is Jay. What we\u2019re referring to is not just the non-cat losses. We\u2019re just talking about non-variability \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, return to whatever view is of normal for these things that will vary from quarter-to-quarter, non-cat losses being one of them, but we said all other loss activity. So we weren\u2019t trying to just spike out the non-cats.\nKai Pan: Okay. I just want to sort of figure out is randomness or is the loss cost trend above your earned pricing.\nAlan Schnitzer: It\u2019s a variety of things for which there\u2019s always going to be normal variability. There\u2019s no fundamental change in our view of loss trend in the quarter.\nKai Pan: Okay, thank you. My follow-up question is on the inflation. Aside from tariff impacts we\u2019ve also seen higher litigations as well as settlement events cost. And how do you think about loss cost trend going forward? And have you discount that in your reserve as well as pricing going forward?\nAlan Schnitzer: I\u2019ll invite Tom to comment on that as it relates to the management liability, but Kai because I imagine that might be your focus. But I will tell you that we certainly see in our own book and read about all the trends that you see and read about that\u2019s reflected in of course our pricing and our reserves and there\u2019s nothing the quarter that surprises us. But Tom why don\u2019t you comment on --?\nTom Kunkel: In our management liability book and again we read what you read but actually we have nothing that is out of the ordinary compared to recent periods when it comes to our own legal expenses. So normal inflation in there, we\u2019re definitely seeing that but we have not experienced anything that is outside of what we\u2019ve experienced in recent periods.\nAlan Schnitzer: And Kai that\u2019s not to say that our view of trend is zero, right. We\u2019re aware of everything going on out there \u2013 at least we think we\u2019re aware of everything going on out there that has the potential to impact those sorts of things and it\u2019s reflected in our view of profitability and in our pricing.\nKai Pan: Great. Thank you so much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks and good morning. One or two questions. First of all, maybe I\u2019m just a bit confused here going back to the answer to Kai\u2019s question. So if we ex out the noise in BI including fire adjustment and the [indiscernible] adjustment, are you suggesting that the underlying margin improvement \u2013 that there was underlying margin improvement and it was in line with what you said in Q1 10-Q or not?\nAlan Schnitzer: No, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re saying. If you take the underlying combined ratio and you eliminate, for example, the fire losses, the observation was there are a number of factors and Greg mentioned the significant ones in his prepared remarks that impacted unfavorably the period-over-period underlying combined ratios. So the net of all those things; some were good guys, some were bad guys but the net of those things was a quarter-over-quarter negative.\nAmit Kumar: Okay. I guess maybe I\u2019ll tie that into the second question to that. If you look at sort of the underlined pricing discussion and you talked about some of the broader segments, can you also talk a bit more about comp trends and what\u2019s going on, on that front and how does that impact the underlying loss ratio going forward?\nAlan Schnitzer: Let me just follow-up quickly on your \u2013 my answer to your prior question. I just want to make sure I\u2019m clear about this. There are always going to be things in a quarter that are variations from our expectations because our view of base year is going to change or the underlying weather is going to change or all the things that Greg mentioned, there are always puts and takes in that process. But what we\u2019re telling you is there\u2019s no fundamental change in the underlying trend. Those are just things that are always going to move one way or the other. So that\u2019s the color I was trying to give you.\nAmit Kumar: Can I just follow up to that and we\u2019ll drop that second question? So what you were saying is this was in the volatility [indiscernible] so in the guidance and the discussion and all the questions, we should expect an acceleration in the gap between pricing and loss cost which will be at a faster pace in Q3 and Q4 and hence result in 2018 margin improvement versus 2017. Is that fair or did I muddle up the thought process?\nAlan Schnitzer: So if you look in our outlook in the 10-Q, we give you a view on what the underlying underwriting margin and underlying combined ratio is going to do compared to the same period in 2017. So you can take a look at that. A significant part of that is we are assuming that putting this quarter aside, what we saw in the corresponding periods in 2017 where we had adverse small weather and we had adverse large loss activity, our view going forward for the second half of '18 is that those things will return to more normalized levels.\nAmit Kumar: Fair enough.\nAlan Schnitzer: Happy to talk to you about that offline and make sure that --\nAmit Kumar: Yes, that\u2019s fine. I think I follow for you\u2019re saying. I think maybe there is an extreme focus on parsing [ph] for the language of the Q and then comparing it to the reported results. But what I understand from your answer is there\u2019s always this additional volatility which one should factor in when looking into underlying trends. Is that fair?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. We\u2019re giving you our best view of outlook in the 10-Q but there are things that are going to change in small ways and there\u2019s a number of those things this quarter and they net \u2013 you can do the math, take out the large losses but they net to what they net to.\nAmit Kumar: Okay. I\u2019ve taken up my question time so I will stop here. Thanks for the answers.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Amit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Good morning. I appreciate some of the answers you have provided before, Jay, and I don\u2019t want to get too hung up on one quarter\u2019s results but the trend in PYD has been down for a couple of years and now that earned pricing is essentially covering trend and BI, is it fair to extrapolate that going forward maybe PYD stabilizes at these levels or perhaps you can use this opportunity to update us on your views of PYD?\nJay Benet: I think my response is going to be something you\u2019re going to feel all that great about in the sense that we don\u2019t have a view and have never had a view of future PYD. Every quarter we do a very, very thorough and diligent review of all of our reserves to make sure that whatever trends we\u2019re seeing, whatever changes in those trends we\u2019re seeing, whatever data we\u2019re seeing is not only factored into the reserve estimates but factored into our pricing on a very current basis. So we make no predictions whatsoever as to the future of PYD. Now looking back at history you can see that we have had considerable amounts of PYD in some periods and less PYD in other periods. So it has fluctuated. There\u2019s no change in the way we think about the business. There\u2019s no change in the way we think about reserving. So I think you can draw your own conclusions as to what might happen in the future but we make no predictions. Our view is we need to get the reserves right. They represent management\u2019s best estimate. And what new information comes up in the future, we adjust it.\nGreg Peters: Okay. I wanted to give it a shot. My second question, in the past you\u2019ve talked about organic innovation and also I realize there is this tremendous loyalty to the independent agent channel, but \u2013 and I\u2019ve asked you guys about this before but insurance tech seems \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of insured tech noise in the marketplace. A lot of it seems focused around disintermediation of the agents. And I was just wondering if you can update us on your perspectives around direct operations not only in personal lines but business?\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure, Greg. You\u2019re exactly right. We have a very active innovation agenda going on. We view that as a very important part of the strategic work that we\u2019re doing and we think it\u2019s important for us and for this industry. So we\u2019re hard at work. Yes, we have for a long time been an independent agent broker company and I think we will for the foreseeable future. I don\u2019t think that distribution channel is going anywhere. And I would say that as we think about insured tech, it goes way beyond distribution. There are opportunities to invest and think about opportunities whether it\u2019s in collection and leveraging new data sources or whether it\u2019s in leveraging artificial intelligence, whether it\u2019s in using drone technology to reduce claim cost. We think very aggressively about innovation across the entire value chain, and so from marketing to claim settlement and everything in between. We do think that distribution is obviously an important part of that and we\u2019re highly focused on it. And we bought Simply Business last year because we knew that advancing our capabilities as it related to engaging with commercial accounts was going to be important and we needed to advance our capabilities. At the moment where you see distribution on a direct basis in commercial insurance, it\u2019s micro. And that\u2019s not just us; that\u2019s the industry. It\u2019s really, really small stuff, think hundreds of dollars of premium but we do see something of a trend there and we\u2019re not going to miss that. We\u2019ll see where it goes and we\u2019ll see how fast it goes but we\u2019re on top of it.\nGreg Peters: Thank you for your answers.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nYaron Kinar: Good morning, everybody. First, maybe a clarification to your answer to Elyse\u2019s question on the inflation commentary in the Q and I apologize if I missed it in your answer. But as I look at the commentary around inflation maybe being a negative for next year and then I look at the commentary around business unit margins being stable or consistent with this year, possibly even better in Business Insurance. Does the commentary around the business unit margins incorporate the risk of inflation going up?\nAlan Schnitzer: The answer is yes. Clearly our view of margins does incorporate a view of loss trends that has a view of severity which in turn has a view of inflation in it. I\u2019ll just remind you that our results are most heavily leveraged to medical wage and toward inflation. So we\u2019re not as highly leveraged to the typical sort of CPI kind of inflation that impacts short-term lines and that we think we can react to. But whether it\u2019s CPI type stuff and the potential impact of tariffs or whether it\u2019s wages or whether it\u2019s medical or social inflation, whatever it is, our view of it is reflected in our outlook in margins. We could be surprised. It could be worse than we think, of course, but we do have a view of it and we look at it on a very, very granular basis aligning to the individual components of our lost cost. So we have a pretty sophisticated process of looking at it and it\u2019s incorporated in our view.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And if I can turn to net investment income again going back to the Q for a second, I think you\u2019re guiding to $20 million to $25 million increases in 2019 per quarter. Maybe you can help me understand what was the duration of over four years and with premium growth accelerating, why wouldn\u2019t that number be higher a year out relative to where it was in \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.\nJay Benet: It\u2019s a good question but you have to realize that it\u2019s really being driven by the actual securities that are maturing in a particular period of time and assumptions associated with the reinvestment rate that\u2019s going to be available at that time. And it will be determined by the actual investment opportunities then and what the yield curve looks like and where interest rates are in general. But at this stage that\u2019s our best view as to what\u2019s maturing and what the interest rates might be.\nYaron Kinar: Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSarah DeWitt: Hi. Good morning. On the weather-related losses and that includes the cats and non-cat weather, you\u2019ve seen elevated weather losses for the last several quarters as you\u2019ve pointed out. So at what point do you call this the new normal and start pricing for it?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, so the question is over what cycle do you look at, at changes in weather patterns? And so just to take you back on a slightly longer-term view, if you go back to 2009 weather was better than we expected; 2010 to 2012, a few year period, that was worst than we expected. Then 2013 to 2015 I think it was better than we expected. 2016 was about on plan. So my point is you look back over time and you have some good periods and you have some bad periods. And so we look at now what\u2019s been a four to six quarter period and we\u2019re not going to overreact to it, but we will react to it. So the first thing we\u2019ll do is we will update our actuarial and weather models for the actuarial activity. So just that alone rolling through our models will change our view of the world if we did nothing else. As we are always looking at recent weather activity and trying to decide how to weigh more recent periods as compared to longer periods, that\u2019s an ongoing process here and part of our thought process around weather. Again, we wouldn\u2019t look at four to six quarters and overreact to that. And then we always look at lessons learned from weather activities and there are always lessons learned any time you have catastrophes like this. So we look at it. We take it in stride. We take it into account. We put it into our models. But we would not look at a year or so and say that we\u2019ve seen a fundamental change because we\u2019ve seen this before.\nSarah DeWitt: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just following up on the Business Insurance pricing, now that earned prices are in line with loss trend, will you still push for higher rates versus the 2% you achieved in the quarter or is that now sufficient to achieve your targeted returns, all else being equal?\nAlan Schnitzer: We will push for rate in those lines and on those accounts where we need it and that\u2019s the way we always execute. We got lots of accounts in our book of business that are rate adequate and we\u2019re going to try really hard to keep those accounts. As always, there\u2019s some portion of our book where we look at an account and say that needs rate and we will continue to try to get rate there. And the aggregate of those individual account decisions will aggregate up to a number. I would say there is sort of a lot of things out there that are working together. So pricing is better. Interest rates are picking up, that\u2019s on a lag basis. It will work its way into net investment income. You\u2019ve got the benefit of tax reform. You\u2019ve got all the other levers that impact profitability; things like selection, mix, claims handling and expense initiatives. So all of that goes into the hopper and we\u2019re always managing all of those levers to make sure that we\u2019re executing towards our return objectives.\nSarah DeWitt: Okay, great. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJosh Shanker: Hi, there. I\u2019ll give you both my questions upfront so you don\u2019t think there\u2019s a long one coming in the back. So I just want to understand and I get more granular I don\u2019t think than you guidance in the 10-Q, but when you say improving margins I\u2019m wondering now that we have the pricing versus loss cost trend out of the way, how much of that is the decision of the non-cat weather and the fire losses and whatnot and how much of the innovations you were talking about in expense save \u2013 you\u2019ve been talking about for a year. I\u2019m wondering if we break between those two things. And the second question, I just want to say one thing about that loss cost trend versus rate. If net renewal premium trend in BI is 2.1%, net premium earned trend is probably somewhere less than that I would guess. Maybe I\u2019m wrong about that. Is that conservative to say that\u2019s covering loss cost trend? I\u2019m just trying to understand that better.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, let me take the second one first. So we don\u2019t think \u2013 we think it\u2019s appropriate that it\u2019s covering loss cost trend. It\u2019s just the map we have and maybe what you\u2019re leaving out, Josh, is the economic impact of the earned exposure, a significant portion of which behaves like rate. And then again \u2013 we all and by that I mean you all get very, very focused on this very narrow rate versus loss trend. And again that ignores the economic component of exposure that behaves like rate and it ignores all the other things that go into improving margin. And again I just mentioned the list but things like selection and mix and claims handling and expense initiatives, that\u2019s all in there. So you can\u2019t look at that 2.1 in isolation without thinking about all the other factors that impact margin. In terms of the outlook, a significant part of the improvement is what was adverse small weather and large losses last year returning to more normal levels. But everything is in the number, right. It reflects everything we know in terms of the outlook. But as we identify in the 10-Q, that is very significantly a return to normal level of small weather and large losses.\nJosh Shanker: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks. Two quick ones here. Michael, I\u2019m just curious, could you give us some thoughts on a competitive environment right now in personal auto insurance? I think we\u2019ve seen some major companies reduce rate. Are you seeing that in the agency system?\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Brian. Yes, I would say certainly the environment in all of our markets is consistently competitive. We have certainly seen the announcements that you\u2019re probably referring to of one carrier in particular taking rate reductions. At least at this point that\u2019s one carrier taking rate reductions. Industry rate remains positive. When we pull filings and do our analysis that we\u2019ve talked to you about in the past around what we\u2019re seeing, we do see most carriers continuing to file for increases. Those increases so far this year are not quite as high as they were in 2017. I think that\u2019s all very consistent with the industry data around loss trend and more of a 9 loss environment that I described earlier. I think that all lines up from our perspective.\nBrian Meredith: Great. And then just one quick follow up. Alan, you did mentioned a little bit about interest rates moving up and that definitely could have some impact I think on pricing. Is that flowing through your models at this point when you think about the higher interest rate environment right now and your kind of thoughts on pricing and profitability by account or is it still too early for that to kind of have an effect?\nAlan Schnitzer: We update our models on a pretty regular basis and they reflect everything that we know or are aware of or think about on an outlook basis. It\u2019s hard to look at any one element in our pricing model and isolate it, but we do have a view of inflation and we put it in there. If you\u2019re talking about interest rates --\nBrian Meredith: Interest rates.\nAlan Schnitzer: You think about net investment income in particular. I would say you need to think about the fact that that will flow through our fixed income portfolio on a lag basis because as Jay Benet just explained the portfolio has to turn over. So the impact of \u2013 the favorable impact of interest rates will be muted by that fact.\nBrian Meredith: Right, but I\u2019m talking more in pricing decisions than commercial lines and is the factor that you typically look particularly at some of your longer --\nAlan Schnitzer: Say that again?\nBrian Meredith: I\u2019m thinking more in pricing kind of decisions with respect to commercial lines and what your rate activity looks like as far as the model and putting in interest rate assumptions. Are we at a point where that may be having an impact on pricing?\nJay Benet: Hi, Brian. This is Jay. Within our pricing models as we\u2019ve said in the past, we take into account not an embedded rate in the portfolio when it comes to looking at the product cash flows. We look at the product cash flows associated with a current interest rate environment and a view towards the future with regard to how things are being invested along the yield curve. So the pricing models themselves would be updated based on current views of interest rates. However, having said that, it\u2019s not done in isolation, as Alan is talking about. And one of the things that you have to look at is what are your return expectations? The return expectations for products change when the 10-year treasury is at 2% versus when the 10-year treasury is at 3%. So it\u2019s not just that it goes in and immediately has a point-for-point, dollar-for-dollar impact on the pricing. It\u2019s a very thoughtful approach to it.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thanks for your answers.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks. And we have time for just one more question.\nOperator: The last question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJay Cohen: Thank you. Just one final question. The non-fixed income yield, do you view that as better than you normally expect, a little worse or in line for the quarter?\nJay Benet: When we think about how that portfolio is doing, we like its performance and on a long-term basis or a plan basis we think it\u2019s performing well. It\u2019s just not performing as well as it did in the prior year quarter. But if you look at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, I think you\u2019ll see the second quarter is very much in line with some recent quarters. And as you know, it\u2019s got a combination mostly of private equity and real estate partnerships and real estate owned. So there\u2019s going to be some fluctuation in it. But we liked the performance of the portfolio.\nJay Cohen: But not far off from what you normally expect?\nJay Benet: Actually, it\u2019s probably a little better than what we would normally expect.\nJay Cohen: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Great. Thank you all for joining us.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Welcome to the First Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions for the completion of formal remarks at which time you\u2019ll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 24, 2018. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our first quarter 2018 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. Before I turn it over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investor section on our website. And now Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported first quarter core income of $678 million generating core return on equity of 11.9%. Core income was up 10% over the prior year quarter driven by higher pretax underwriting income and a lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. Catastrophe losses of $280 million after tax were slightly higher than the also unusually high level of catastrophe losses in the prior year quarter. Results this quarter were impacted by among other events four March nor\u2019easters one of those storms cat 15 generated high claim counts for us in Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. with some areas experiencing hurricane force winds of up to 90 miles an hour. Both historically and going forward on a model basis, we like the risk adjusted returns in the Mid-Atlantic and accordingly by design we have meaningful market shares in those states. Results in the quarter were also impacted by mudslides in California and a severe winter storm in the UK, so all in an unusual weather quarter. Despite the high level of catastrophe losses, underwriting income increased and record Q1 net earned premiums were contributing factor. We achieve the topline growth while continuing to deliver a strong underlying combined ratio of 92.4%. We also continue to invest in the strategic initiatives we\u2019ve discussed with you what carefully managing our expense ratio. Our expense ratio has improved by about 1 point in the 2016 level and also down slightly from the prior year quarter. We accomplished that to discipline growth in our topline, disciplined expense management and the successful execution of our productivity and efficiency initiatives. Also noteworthy in the quarter, pretax income from our fixed income investment portfolio increased the first time since 2008. Jay will have more to say about that shortly. Turning to the topline of production, we are very pleased with the continued successful execution of our marketplace strategies. Net written premiums grew by 5% to a first quarter record of $6.8 billion another strong quarter with growth in all segments. To a large degree this growth once again reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change. That speaks the high-quality of the premium growth. Greg, tom and Michael will provide more detail on production at the segment level, but I\u2019ll take a minute to comment on the commercial pricing environment. Renewal rate change in domestic business insurance reached 1.6 points with renewal premium change of 4.5 points. In both cases, the highest levels in three years. I\u2019ll also note that once again we achieved renewal rate gains in the quarter more broadly across our middle market accounts compared to recent period. We\u2019re pleased with these results particularly in light of the pricing pressure in the workers comp line. There\u2019s nothing about the workers comp pricing environment so far that surprises us given the industry\u2019s favorable last experience. Excluding workers comp, pure renewal rate change for domestic business insurance was up 3.3 points for the quarter compared to nine-tenths of a point a year ago and 2.4 points in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved pricing improvement and record retention. As you\u2019ve heard us say in terms of BI looking ahead, there\u2019s a gap between where return to trending and what we\u2019d like them to be trending. So we\u2019ll continue to see great gains thoughtfully and deliberately. I\u2019ll take just a minute to provide an update on strategic initiatives. As we explained at our Investor Day last fall, we\u2019re investing and making sure that our competitive advantages continue to set us apart in the changing world. We\u2019re focused on extending our lead in risk expertise improving the experience for a customers, agents and brokers and enhancing productivity and efficiency. One of the specific initiatives we discussed was a pilot program to compliment our local underwriting expertise with centralized underwriting of less complex accounts in lower touch business centers. Today, we have all four plan business centers online and step to support our commercial accounts business with all eligible renewal flowing through them. We expect it all eligible, new business will also be handled through the business centers over the next couple of quarters. Although its still early days we\u2019re pleased with the productivity gains we\u2019re seeing which free up our local underwriters to spend more time with our agent and broker partners pursuing larger more complex account opportunities. Quote activity is up with the increases coming across all accounts sizes. Again its early, but this is the type of outcome the business centers were designed to create. We\u2019re also making progress on key initiatives in both our BOND & SPECIALTY business and in Personal Lines. In Personal Lines for example, we\u2019re pleased with the progress so far in the rollout of our new Quantum Home 2.0 product. You\u2019ll hear more about that from Michael. Lastly, before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019m pleased to report that is reflection of confidence in our business, our Board of Directors has declared a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.77 per share. This marks the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases dating back to the St. Paul Travelers merger bringing the compound annual growth rate in the dividend to about 10% over that period. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Benet: Thanks, Alan. As Alan said, we\u2019re pleased with core income was up 10% this quarter, $678 million versus $614 million in the prior year quarter, which resulted in core ROE of 11.9%. Catastrophe losses were $354 million pretax, which was unusually high for the first quarter although comparable to last year\u2019s unusually high first quarter. Two significant storms in March accounted for almost 70% of the cat losses, cat number 15 an unusual winter windstorm in the Northeast U.S. and cat number 17 a tornado hail storm that did considerable damage in the Southeast United States. On a more positive note net favorable prior year reserve development, which I\u2019ll discuss in more detail shortly, was $150 million pretax or $69 million higher than in the prior year quarter with each of our segments contributing. Our underlying combined ratio remained strong at 92.4%, up only slightly from 91.7% in the prior your quarter due to normal quarterly variability and both loss activity mostly from non-cat weather and expenses. Pretax net investment income of $603 million was slightly below the prior year quarter, but there is an important story underneath. In the past, you\u2019ve heard me say over and over again that fixed income NII declined due to historically low interest rates. This quarter pretax fixed income NII of $500 million increased by $12 million compared to the prior year quarter first time we\u2019ve seen an increase in many years. This was driven by the more favorable interest rate environment particularly for short-term rates as well as an increase in our average invested assets due to growing net written premiums in recent periods. If you add in the benefit of the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, fixed income NII on after tax basis increased quarter-over-quarter by $36 million. Looking forward to the rest of 2018, we\u2019d expect after tax fixed income NII to increase by approximately $40 million to $45 million each quarter as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2017. Te non-fixed income portfolio continued to perform well delivering $113 million of pretax NII. Within core income, income tax expense was lower than the prior year quarter by $30 million driven by $74 million benefit in the current quarter that resulted from the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate for all the tax exempt income. Partially offset by the inclusion in the prior year quarter of the $39 million benefit that resulted from successfully closing out our federal income tax expense for 2013 and 2014. As I mentioned consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development was $150 million pretax this quarter compared to $81 million in the prior year quarter. Business Insurance\u2019s net favorable reserve development was $66 million pretax compared to $61 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic workers comp and commercial property, partially offset by higher than expected loss experience in domestic commercial auto. Bond & Specialty\u2019s PYD was $35 million pretax compared to $14 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by domestic management liability, while PI had net favorable reserve development of $49 million pretax compared to $6 million in the prior year quarter, primarily driven by domestic homeowners and auto. On a combined statutory Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subsidiaries, all accident years across all product lines, in the aggregate, and our product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter except commercial auto, which developed unfavorably by approximately $50 million pretax. Operating cash flows of $554 million remained strong, although lower than first quarter 2017, primarily due to the relatively high level of cat claim payments. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $1.8 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. The recent run up in interest rates is benefiting fixed income NII cause net unrealized investment gains to decrease considerably from $1.1 billion after tax of year end 2017 to $133 million after tax at the end of the first quarter. And this decrease in net unrealized investment gains was the driver behind 3% decrease in book value per share from year-end 2017 from $87.46 to $85.03. I remind you the changes in net unrealized investment gains or losses do not impact the matter in which we manage our investment portfolio or our business. We generally help fixed income investments to maturity, the quality remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no regular \u2013 little or no impact on regulatory capital. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains or losses was $84.54 or 1% higher than the beginning of the year and 4% higher than at the end of last year\u2019s first quarter. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses. Despite the high level of cat losses, allowing us to return almost $600 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. We paid dividends of $197 million and repurchase $401 million of our common shares this quarter, including $350 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program and $51 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.72 to $0.77 per share. With that let me now turn the microphone over to Greg.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks Jay. Business insurance had a strong quarter with segment income of $452 million, up $10 million from the prior year quarter benefiting from a lower tax rate, as well as higher earned premium volume. The combined ratio of 97.5% included just under 4 points of cats an unusually high level for the first quarter as it was last year. The underlying combined ratio of 95.5% was 1.1 points higher than the prior year quarter driven by loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing, as well as normal quarterly fluctuations in both loss activity and expenses. The impact from loss cost trends exceeding earned pricing that I just referenced has moderated from recent quarters and was in line with our expectations. Net written premiums for the quarter were $4 billion, up 4% over the prior year quarter with domestic net written premiums up 3% driven by strong production results. International net written premiums were up 3%, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Turning to domestic production, retention improved to a record 86% from an already high level a new business was strong at $525 million. As Alan mentioned, renewal rate change was 1.6 points and renewal premium change was 4.5 points. We\u2019re pleased with these results particularly considering the pricing pressure in workers\u2019 comp associated with strong industry profitability. Outside of comp, we were encouraged that we achieved renewal rate gains broadly across the product portfolio as rate in auto, property, umbrella, CMP, ENGL increased for the third consecutive quarter on both the sequential and year-over-year basis. Auto continues to be the line with the highest level of rate, while property has improved meaningfully from a year ago, particularly in loss impacted areas. Our results for the quarter reflect our continued deliberate and successful execution in the marketplace. Turning to the businesses, in Select, as with all our businesses we\u2019re making strategic investments in technology and workflow initiatives to drive growth and we\u2019re encouraged with the progress we\u2019re making. Retention remains strong at 83% and new business was up 8% from the prior year quarter. Renewal rate change remains positive. Given the returns in this business, we\u2019re pleased with these production results. Turning to Middle Market, retention remained historically high at 88%. Renewal premium change was 3.9 points with renewal rate change of 1.5% up from 1.3% in the fourth quarter and up 1 point from a year ago. New business premiums of $318 million were strong and consistent with the prior year quarter. So all in for the segment, it was a good start to 2018 and we\u2019re pleased with our market execution and given the early adoption from our distribution partners, we\u2019re encouraged about the impact that our technology and workflow initiatives we\u2019ll have in our results. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty Insurance.\nTom Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty\u2019s operating results were very strong, with segment income of $173 million up $28 million from the prior year quarter, due to a higher level of favorable PYD and higher earned premium volume. The underlying combined ratio was also very strong at 80.7% more than 1 point lower than the prior year quarter, reflecting improvement in both the underlying loss and expense ratio. As to the top line net written premiums for the quarter were up 6%, driven by solid growth in both our domestic surety and domestic management liability businesses. The increase in the surety net written premium was driven by a mix of relatively larger bonds in the quarter. Turning to production in our domestic management liability businesses, we continue to execute our strategy to retain a substantial percentage of our high quality portfolio, while pursuing attractive new business. We are pleased that the retention came in at a record high of 89% for the quarter and that new business was strong up 11% from the first quarter last year. Renewal premium change of 3.6 points was up from the fourth quarter due to an increase in exposure. So Bond & Specialty results were excellent and we continue to feel great about our growth and returns, as well as the opportunities that our strong market positions and competitive advantages present for the future. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael, who will talk to you about Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Tom, and good morning everyone. Personal Insurance began the year by continuing to deliver on our objectives of improving auto profitability, while maintaining momentum in our homeowners business. Net written premiums of $2.3 billion grew 8%, once again driven by higher pricing primarily in auto and healthy growth in homeowners\u2019 policies enforce. Personal Insurance segment income of $129 million was up from $89 million in the prior year quarter, with an improvement in the combined ratio to 97.5% primarily driven \u2013primarily due to higher favorable reserve development. Catastrophe losses contributed 9 points to the combined, an unusually high level for our first quarter, but similar to last year. On an underlying basis, improved profitability in auto was essentially offset by a higher level of non-cat weather losses in property. Importantly, we remain pleased with the expense ratio of 26.8%. It\u2019s worth noting that the expense ratio for the segment has improved by about three-fold points from 2013, the year we announced the start of our cost reduction initiatives. In Agency Auto, the combined ratio for the quarter was 94.8%, down considerably from the prior year quarter, due to a 2.3 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio driven by the rate actions taken in the past several quarters, along with the 2.3 point benefit from favorable prior year development. As a reminder, the first quarter combined ratio is typically a couple of points lower than average due to seasonality. In Agency Homeowners, the first quarter combined ratio of 98.5%, included almost 21 points of cat losses and a benefit of 2.4 points from favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 80.2% was 2.6 points higher than the prior year quarter driven primarily by higher non-cat weather losses. Turning to the top line, Agency Auto premiums grew by 9% and we\u2019re achieved 10 points of renewal premium change down slightly from the peak of 11 points last quarter, in line with our plans. Retention declined modestly as expected given the pricing actions and fifth levels in auto have been holding steady. In Agency Homeowners & Other, premiums increased by 5%, demonstrating continued momentum with another quarter of a healthy fifth growth. Our efforts to maintain the steady increase in property policies enforce have been successful, even as we have intentionally slowed the fifth growth in auto. As Alan mentioned, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we introduced our newest property product, Quantum Home 2.0 in three states, and so far the response from agents and customers is in line with our expectations. Early returns are demonstrating the benefits of Quantum Home 2.0\u2019s flexibility sophistication and ease of use. We\u2019ll roll out several more states during the second quarter and then continue with waves of five or so states at a time throughout 2018 and 2019. The gradual rollout and implementation should enable us to sustain the momentum we\u2019ve already generated and support profitable steady growth going forward. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Michael. Before I turn it back to Gabby to open it up for Q&A, I\u2019ll share with you that we\u2019ve just returned from our annual conference with our most significant distribution partners, who collectively represent about half of our premium. We all left with the continued confidence and the strength of our relationships with these business leaders in their firms and feeling tremendous support for the strategic initiatives that we have underway. It\u2019s a great reminder that our position with distribution is an important competitive advantage and one that\u2019s hard to replicate. On a customer side, we also just returned from RIMS, the annual conference for the large account risk management community. We were honored to receive National Underwriters Risk Manager Choice Awards in five lines of business, the most of any company. Taken together, the feedback we\u2019re receiving from our customers, agents and brokers suggest that we\u2019re on the right track in our work to continue to lead the market in understanding risk in the products and services, our customers need and to provide them a great experiences. Lastly, as some of you know, after a decade of leading Investor Relations for us, Gabby Nawi has been recruited away by our own Travelers Personal Insurance team to take a role in their finance group, which is great for her and great for us. Gabby\u2019s insight has been incredibly valuable to me and the entire leadership team. I\u2019m grateful and we all wish her continued success. We will be announcing her successor shortly. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. And thank you for those kind words. Chris, we\u2019re ready to start the Q&A portion.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKai Pan: Thank you. Good morning. First, congrats, Gabby, and I guess we\u2019ll miss you next quarter.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you, Kai.\nKai Pan: Yes. My first question is on pricing. If I do the math, first quarter increase in BI, 1.6%. But if you look by segments, Select Accounts is up point 2 and Middle Market, up 1.5, which implied maybe the National Property and others increased much more. So can you compare and contrast for us like the deceleration in term price increase in the small accounts. Why big increase in the national accounts?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey Kai, this is this is Greg Toczydlowski. Good morning. Just answer the first part of that question. Yes, you\u2019re correct. The reason why the two of the businesses that are illustrated in the documents are below the total is because of the national property business. We\u2019ve been very successful in achieving rate, particularly in the cat exposed areas in National Property and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing when that rolls up into the total number. In terms of Select, the second part of your question, we\u2019ve shared with you for some time now around how we\u2019ve been thinking about that business and how we\u2019ve been very focused to have an adequate set of returns in that business and we\u2019re very comfortable with the returns in that business right now. So that\u2019s a output of a lot of deliberate execution of really thoughtfully growing that business because we are returning the returns that are hit in our threshold today in that business. So that\u2019s what underneath that.\nKai Pan: Great. My follow-up question is for Alan. You mentioned performance transform in your annual letter. I just want to follow-up on the transform part. And could you tell us a bit more about initiatives, both internally as well as potential acquisitions on that front?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Sure, Kai. Thanks for the question. Thanks for reading the annual letter. I guess I\u2019ll refer you back to our Investor Day, and we discussed they are the \u2013 the forces have changed, we see impacting our business and they need to make sure that our competitive advantages continue to set us apart in the world that\u2019s obviously changing. We\u2019ve been incredibly successful over the last decade or two, and the competitive advantages we\u2019ve had has serviced us very well. But we\u2019re very mindful that what\u2019s going to make us successful over the next decade to some degree will be different than what\u2019s made us successful. And so at a broad level, we\u2019ve set two objectives. We want to be the undeniable choice for the customer and we want to be an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. And underneath that, we\u2019ve got three priorities that letter up to that. So one of the things that\u2019s made a successful for long time that\u2019s an expertise in risk and the products and services our customer\u2019s need that \u2013 that\u2019s we put them on a pedestal for a long time and we\u2019ll continue to put that on the pedestal and invest in that. So think data analytics, third-party data, that type of thing. In addition, we are highly focused on the experience for our customers and our agents and brokers. And some of the technology and workflow investments you\u2019ve heard us talk about are designed to do that. And then third, productivity and efficiency. We\u2019re highly focused on just making sure that we\u2019ve got the ability to do more with less and that creates flexibility for us. It gives us the opportunity to take the output of the productivity and efficiency and either let that fall to the bottom line and invested in new or other strategic initiatives. We\u2019ll put in the price if we need to. So there is a lot of things going on across the company in all three of our business segments, in our technology group, in claim. But all of the things that we\u2019re working on latter up really inside of that framework. And we\u2019ve talked about a lot of those specifically at Investor Day and I\u2019ll refer you back to that maybe for more specifics.\nKai Pan: Do you need acquisitions to transform the business?\nAlan Schnitzer: So do we need acquisitions? I do not think we need acquisitions Kai, but nobody should take away from that that were not highly focused on it, right? I\u2019ve said for a long time and I\u2019ll continue to say that our shareholders should demand that we are active in terms of M&A. And that in the lines of business that we\u2019re interested in and the geographies we\u2019re interested in, we are very active and we are \u2013 we will continue to be. We often say some of the best deals we do or the best deals we don\u2019t do, so we\u2019re highly disciplined about it. And we\u2019ve shared with you many times what the lens is for thinking about transactions, so we\u2019re anxious to do them. If they improve our return profile, if they lower volatility of if they provide another important strategic benefits for us. And so highly focused on looking at things that match up to that criteria. But no, we don\u2019t feel like we need to do it. And I would say, Kai, that again if you shouldn\u2019t take away from this any change in propensity to think about or do a deal. But one of the things that we think more and more about today that maybe we didn\u2019t 5 years or 10 years ago is the opportunity cost and the potential distraction from focus on all the organic innovation that we\u2019re doing. We think it\u2019s really important in a changing world. We think that there\u2019s a real benefit to doing that. We\u2019ve got the resources, we\u2019ve got the talent, we\u2019ve got the intellect, we\u2019ve got a lack of distraction. And so we \u2013 again, you shouldn\u2019t take away any change of propensity to do a deal, but that\u2019s a wrinkle we think about when we assess M&A.\nKai Pan: Great. Thank you so much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJay Cohen: Thank you. On the business Insurance side, will you talk about your retention being now, I guess, an all-time higher. Certainly, a multiple year high, is that the plan? I mean you\u2019ve got the balance obviously pricing, new business and retention. Do you feel as if that retention is getting up even too high? Or maybe what would be too high?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Good morning, Jay. This is Greg. Yes, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time looking at the combination of retention, new business and rate all the time. But most of the time, it\u2019s not at the macro level of what we\u2019re looking at. It really is a very granular and local execution. We think we have a high-quality book of business, and so we like the retention of where it\u2019s at. We\u2019re very comfortable with that, and we\u2019re trying to retain that book as much as possible. Obviously, a competitive marketplace out there right now. But when you look at the combination of retention, new business and rate, we\u2019re comfortable with where all three of those are.\nJay Cohen: That\u2019s helpful, Greg. Thank you. Just one follow-up on Homeowners. The deterioration from the last year on the underlying number, you mentioned some of that or a lot of it was due to non-cat weather. Is it possible to quantify that relative to what you normally would expect?\nMichael Klein: Sure, jay. This is Michael. I mean I think what I would say is when you look at cat and non-cat weather, first of all, you have to remember that the way that we parse that between one category and the other, the dollars can move from one bucket to another based on the magnitude and the type of the events we\u2019re experiencing. So it\u2019s a little bit artificial to give you a number for the non-cat weather variance. But round numbers, you can think of it as a sort of 1 point or 2 points in the quarter. But again, some of that is dependent upon the mix between cat events and non-cat events, but I would say 1 point or 2 points of adverse relative to expectations in the quarter.\nJay Cohen: Got it.\nJay Benet: If you\u2019re thinking about it across companies, you got to remember that we define cat \u2013 we draw the line in different places in terms of cat and non-cat.\nJay Cohen: Absolutely. But the good news is as you guys do it consistently, at least for yourself, so we can compare year-to-year.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes.\nJay Cohen: Thanks a lot.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks for the question.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks and good morning. Two quick questions. The first question goes back, I guess, to the discussion on pricing. In your letter, you talk about the more significant factor being the low interest rates and loss cost inflation outpacing pricing gains. Would it be possible to get your view on interest rates and loss cost inflation with some specificity?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Amit, I\u2019m not sure \u2013 Good morning. I\u2019m not sure what specificity you\u2019re looking for. And what we\u2019ve consistently said, certainly in BI, is we think about loss trend as a four across the whole book. Obviously, different lines, different businesses have different loss trends in them, but over time, we think about it as a four.\nAmit Kumar: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I guess what I was trying to ask if there is obviously a lot of debate amongst the investors with the rising interest rate and the near-term rise in the 10-year and how should they be thinking about loss cost. And has that changed your view versus, let\u2019s say, going into end of Q4? I guess that\u2019s what I was asking. Has there been any urgency in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about pricing versus loss cost. Or based on I guess your answer, there is no real change based on the long-term view? Is that a fair assertion?\nAlan Schnitzer: I got it. I got your question. So I would say that despite where loss trends have been, we always assume that there is a return to more normal levels in inflation. So certainly, there\u2019s no sense of panic or urgency when generally what we\u2019ve been seeing is generally inside of our expectations. We see that CPI moving, but as you know from us, we\u2019re most heavily leveraged to medical wage and poor inflation. And sometimes that\u2019s good for us, right? When you\u2019ve got wage inflation, for example, that contributes to exposure in workers comp payrolls would be one example of that. There\u2019s probably benefits on the investment income from a rising rate environment. To the extent that there is inflation that is contributing to loss cost. That wouldn\u2019t necessarily surprise us because we do expect some of that. What\u2019s important is what is inflation relative to our expectations and do we have that data analytics and know-how wherewithal to see it when it comes, and we think we do. So no sense of urgency. And I would say generally speaking across all of our businesses, more or less in line with expectations.\nAmit Kumar: And okay, that\u2019s helpful. And my final question is going back to, I guess, Kai\u2019s question. In your letter, you talk about we will look for opportunities, et cetera, lower our volatility. Does that rule out, I guess, the reinsurance companies or hybrid companies making the cut? The reason why I ask is clearly, there\u2019s a lot of debate and discussion amongst the other companies. And then have you seen the validation excel question of that acquisitions? So I\u2019m just wondering would that be a non-starter based on your comments regarding the volatility? Or am I reading too much into the letter?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think well, let me answer in two ways. Yes, I think you\u2019re reading too much into it and that we don\u2019t mean to include or exclude anything categorically. So I wouldn\u2019t read that to exclude anything. Having said that, I\u2019ll tell you that we\u2019ve been pretty explicit over recently long period of time that just given our core capabilities and skill sets reinsurances and the business has been particularly attractive to us.\nAmit Kumar: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the answer. And good luck for the future and thanks, Gabby for all your help over the years.\nGabriella Nawi: Thanks, Amit.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Amit.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question, I\u2019m looking at the outlook in your 10-Q. You guys within Business Insurance point 2 renewal premium change and you compare it to last year same that it\u2019s going to be higher than the 2017 level. How do you see the back three quarters the year-endreference to the first quarter? And then also, if you can tie in your response to that question, did you see great momentum pick up as we went through the months? The quarter meaning was March rates higher than what you had seen in January?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Elyse, so the way we gave the outlook this period was to tell you that for the back three quarters of the year, it will be higher than the back three quarters of the prior year. And I think we leave it there and probably not comment on where it\u2019s going to come in relative to the first quarter. And yes, there was some pricing momentum quarter-to-quarter throughout the first quarter.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then my second question\u2026\nAlan Schnitzer: I\u2019m sorry. Elyse, I\u2019m sorry. It increase month-to-month throughout the quarter is what I meant to say.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you. And then my second question, in terms of Business Insurance margin, you guys said that rate \u2013 earned rate was below trend in the quarter, in line with expectations. When you think about your outlook for the year and based off of the rate you\u2019re taking, when do you think in your mind earned rate should start to exceed trend?\nAlan Schnitzer: There\u2019s a lot of estimation involved with that, Elyse, because there are some components of exposure that we consider to be economically like rate. So it\u2019s hard to give you the precise date or time at which that\u2019s going to happen, but I can tell you that we\u2019re getting, at least on a written basis, pretty close if not there already.\nElyse Greenspan: And in terms of exposure growth that you guys see more or less rate? Would that pick up in the quarter two within the renewal premium change?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think exposure was pretty consistent positive, but pretty consistent throughout the quarter.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJay Gelb: Thank you. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio deteriorated year-over-year. And I know you gave some insight on that. I was just hoping you can discuss it a little further, given the \u2013 I think the expectation for the full year was for it to be slightly better year-over-year.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. So we give you beyond the underlying and its insurance. There\u2019s always going to be things that impact normal volatility and that\u2019s really what we saw. So let\u2019s call it about a point. About half of that was rate versus loss trend. And by the way, as Greg said, that\u2019s moderated. It\u2019s better than where it was in prior quarters and we think that\u2019s heading in the right direction, as I just said in answering lease\u2019s question. And the rest of it is just normal volatility on losses and expenses, and we see that from time to time. So think weather, think large losses, think mix. All the sorts of things that impact period to period volatility.\nJay Gelb: Okay. So you still think for the full year 2018 could be a better underlying in Business Insurance than 2017?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, we gave you the outlook and we set underlying margins higher compared to the prior year and underlying combined ratio slightly lower compared to same period to prior year.\nJay Gelb: I see, okay. On the pricing side, that was helpful to give the rate change ex-worker\u2019s comp, but workers\u2019 comp is a major portion of the premium volumes. So I\u2019m wondering should we expect, given the downward pressure on comp, any overall further improvement in the pace of rate in BI?\nAlan Schnitzer: We do give you \u2013 well, I mean, we certainly give you the outlook in the 10-Q relative to the prior year. And as you heard me just say, we think it\u2019s going to continue to be higher year-over-year and I think we\u2019ll probably stop there.\nJay Gelb: Okay. And then just switching gears last question, on personal auto, PIF slow to 1% growth although profitability certainly improved. I\u2019m wondering if given the sharp slowdown in PIF growth. Could that go negative in personal auto?\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jay. It\u2019s Michael Klein. It certainly could. I think we would look at it and say, plus or minus a point or around flat is where we\u2019re anticipating it\u2019s going to bottom. And obviously, it will depend upon our rate actions relative to the market and how they are absorbed. But at least at this point, if it does go negative, we think it will be slightly and our objective would be to put the business \u2013 the auto book sort of back on the trajectory for growth towards late 2018.\nJay Gelb: Okay. Potentially, return to growth in late 2018. Thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. I guess just keeping it on personal auto. If you could just maybe tell us about how the competitive environment has changed, I guess, in the first three months of the year, if there\u2019s been any change following the tax reform bill?\nMichael Klein: I would say the competitive environments remain broadly consistent. We track predominantly our indicator for that would be tracking rate filings amongst our competitors, and we see a little bit of bouncing around there. And there was a little bit of a slowdown in competitor rate in the first quarter if you review competitive filings, but a lot of that has probably more to do with just the typical timing of when filings are made than it does anything to do with the impact of tax is on rate filings. And I would just \u2013 maybe broaden that slightly and just say when you think about the tax impact on filed rate, particularly in auto, our perspective is that it closes the gap, but it doesn\u2019t eliminate it. The estimated industry combined ratio for auto stage is remained in 105 to 107 range, depending upon which estimates you look at. So think round numbers, at least a 10 point rate need for the industry there. And all else being equal, maybe tax reform drop at a couple of points, but it\u2019s not going to mitigate the rate need and won\u2019t be a key driver of reduced rate activity in the marketplace we don\u2019t think.\nRyan Tunis: That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just \u2013 I guess on the BI side, going down into the normal volatility component of the combined ratio deterioration. Was that \u2013 would you said that was just related to property type losses? Or was there a casualty component as well? I mean, I\u2019m curious to see maybe an increased frequency in casualty related claims.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey, Ryan, this is Greg. Just to echo Alan\u2019s earlier comments and to give you texture to your comment. It was a mix of different product lines, but predominantly was property. You can think about some of the extreme weather that we had in the first quarter and there would be a cat window of a certain period of time and you can think frozen pipes that extend beyond that window of time that is a large loss activity like that would be driving some of the volatility there.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then just one more on just the commercial auto. $50 million of adverse development. That\u2019s how if you\u2019ve been align, we\u2019ve identified as somewhat problematic. Just curious what you saw this quarter that maybe was different and led to the reserve addition.\nAlan Schnitzer: Ryan, we obviously not a new story. We\u2019ve been watching it. We react to the data that we have. It\u2019s the line we are getting the most rate in, and we\u2019re underwriting for it. In the quarter, a little bit more severity on the smaller claims actually is what we saw.\nGabriella Nawi: Great, thank you. Next question and before we continue, so I can just remind you also limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you very much. I want to congratulate you, but also some questions on the dividends. You pointed out that over the past 14 years, it\u2019s gone up by 10%. But the last two years, the increase has been 7. How does the dividend policy relate to your view of EPS growth? And how do you consider cash flow from repurchases versus dividends? And I guess I\u2019m getting it finally, why the slowdown in the rate of the dividend growth?\nJay Benet: Hi, Josh. This is Jay. In looking at our dividends, we look at in relation to a number of things. One is what the dividend yield is and other is. What the payout ratio is. How that compares to others in the industry. And the science behind it as well as a lot of judgment. If you look back at where things were several years ago, balancing all that out. And also given the size of the decreases in the average number of shares outstanding because of all the buybacks, all of that translated into the actions that you saw before. With our stock price at the level that it\u2019s at now, even buying back the same dollar amount, we\u2019re buying back fewer shares. So keeping the payout in terms of dollars somewhere in the $750 million to $800 million range, again, getting back to yield in payout ratios has caused us to look at something more in line with 7% as opposed to 10%. But we looked at what we think our future earnings are going to be or how we\u2019re relatively short period of time and make that determination.\nAlan Schnitzer: Josh, I would just add to that. We understand that there\u2019s a component of our shareholder base that\u2019s looking for the dividend and we want to make sure that we\u2019re paying a competitive dividend rate for that component of our shareholder group. But this also insurance and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, and we want to make sure that we\u2019ve set it at a level where under hopefully just about any foreseeable circumstance, we continue to pay the dividend and don\u2019t have to rethink it. So that, in addition to what Jay shared, those two factors play into the decision as well.\nGreg Toczydlowski: And then I would add one other thing to what Alan just said that, as you know, we have an ongoing policy of returning capital that we don\u2019t need to support our business to the shareholders. So whether it\u2019s an increase in dividends or whether it\u2019s a share repurchases, all of the balances out to returning the excess capital and that\u2019s not changed.\nJosh Shanker: Well, I appreciate the answers and I\u2019ll just add my sendoff regards to Gabby, but I hope she won\u2019t get stranger.\nGabriella Nawi: Thanks, Josh. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney. Please go ahead.\nLarry Greenberg: Good morning and thank you. Just going back to auto, a good underlying loss ratio in the quarter recognizing there\u2019s some seasonality to the first quarter, but still looks strong. And when you look at that and then maybe in addition, the favorable development on the 2017 year. Is auto coming in a little bit better than you would have thought at this point?\nMichael Klein: Larry, it\u2019s Michael. Thanks for the question. I would say autos coming in about where we expected. As I think Jay mentioned, we did have favorable prior year development in auto. But importantly, that was really driven mostly by catastrophes and loss adjustment expenses. So sort of more of a one-off driver of that PYD then sort of a change in our view of underlying dynamics. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into the auto PYD in that commentary. But I would say broadly it\u2019s coming in about as expected, and we\u2019re pleased with it.\nLarry Greenberg: Great, thanks. And then is there any color you could give, I guess this is for jay, on the non-fixed income piece of NII for the second quarter, given the lag in reporting that?\nJay Benet: I\u2019ll let Bill Heyman address that.\nBill Heyman: Hi, this is Bill. Are you talking about the quarter, the quarter that we are currently in? Or about the quarter just ended, which is the first quarter.\nLarry Greenberg: Yes, I\u2019m talking about the quarter we\u2019re in.\nBill Heyman: Well, only about 20 days into it. And historically, we have not really commented on what we\u2019re seeing. So I think I\u2019m going to keep to that.\nGabriella Nawi: Great. Next question please.\nAlan Schnitzer: Larry, are we missing the question?\nLarry Greenberg: Excuse me.\nAlan Schnitzer: Are we missing the question? If you\u2019re asking about the second quarter, obviously, we couldn\u2019t comment on that. But are we missing the question about the first quarter?\nLarry Greenberg: No, no, no, I\u2019m sorry. Just I given that I think your non-fixed income is reported on a quarter lag or depending a few months \u2013 a couple of months lag. We saw a bit of volatility in the first quarter\u2026\nAlan Schnitzer: I think, we probably have too many discrete GP relationships to combine them and give you anything meaningful.\nLarry Greenberg: Fair enough, thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Larry.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks, good morning. The general administrative expenses in both BI and PI was up faster than it had been in previous quarters. And also can you explain what\u2019s going on?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Good morning, Meyer. So let me start with a total and I\u2019m happy to go further into the segments, but simply business and FX would be about half of it for the total. And the other half, now we\u2019re getting into a relatively small dollars on the total G&A base. Other half would be timing. So extrapolating out to the segments per Business Insurance, most of it gets explained through Simply Business and through FX. In Personal Insurance, it\u2019s variability and contingent commissions and then some timing.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, great. And then question, I think predominately personalized, but maybe not. When so nationwide obviously that they are going to an independent agency distribution model, how does Travelers plan to respond to that in terms of the growth opportunities?\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Meyer. It\u2019s Michael. I\u2019ll take it and I think you\u2019re right. It could be broader than BI, but I\u2019ll sort of address that broadly. First, they did recently announce that they\u2019re making those changes, but it\u2019s important to know that it\u2019s not a brand new initiative for them. So certainly, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all well aware that through Harvey [indiscernible] they trade with independent agents already as a corporation. But even underneath the nationwide brand, they\u2019ve had a number of nationwide captive agents that have had access to the independent agent market already. And in fact, they have an operation called nationwide broker services that those captive agents can access other markets through, and Travelers is one of many companies that actually trade with that brokerage services organization. So a, it\u2019s not brand-new. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve seen and been monitoring. And in fact, it\u2019s a trading relationship that we have. I would say on balance, we have a couple of observations. First of all, Alan mentioned our strength with independent agent distribution. As a franchise, we think that\u2019s a continued competitive advantage for us and it is our primary focus in terms of distribution. But I would say that we primarily view this change as an opportunity to explore additional distribution points. We will certainly monitor and evaluate nationwide\u2019s performance with independent agents as we monitor and evaluate any competitors, results in the independent agent channel. But again, on balance, we\u2019d say something that\u2019s been developing for a while and on the margin probably more an opportunity than a threat.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Thanks very much. And good luck, all and Gabby.\nGabriella Nawi: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSarah DeWitt: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on your latest thoughts on U.S. tax reform and the impact of competition. And given you\u2019ve seen in other industries like mortgage insurance, you saw one company pass along the entire benefit to customers. Does that change your view now at all about the impact on competition and pricing?\nJay Benet: Hi, good morning, Sarah. No, it really doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve said pretty consistently that we\u2019ve got some ground to cover in tax reform helps, but it doesn\u2019t close the GAAP. And you really have to look at our pricing objectives holistically. So you\u2019ve got to take into account capital requirements and the adequacy of expiring prices and loss trend and the tax rate. We put all those things into the blender and what comes out is as we look ahead rate need. So we continue to think current course and speed. And from a market perspective, again, I\u2019ll just remind you that not the whole market benefits from tax reform. You\u2019ve got both U.S. and domestic insurers who are positioned differently from a tax perspective. And even among U.S. competitors, those that don\u2019t have significant underwriting profit or underlying lost don\u2019t benefit to the same degree as those within underwriting profit. So it\u2019s not like the entire P&C business. The trades in the U.S. is all of a sudden flush and returns are \u2013 I think, at target levels.\nSarah DeWitt: Okay. Great, thanks. And then just following-up on the Business Insurance pricing, I think you\u2019ve talked about previously pushing for price increases to keep pace with loss inflation, which is about 4%. But do you think you can get there if you are keeping Select Accounts flat? It seems like you would need a lot of price increase in the other subsegments of Business Insurance and I\u2019m just wondering to what extent that\u2019s achievable?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Sarah. So it\u2019s sort of a broad aspirational comment that we would like pricing to keep up with loss trend. We think that makes sense, but we don\u2019t execute for that headline numbers, right. We look at every account. We look at the circumstances of that account and sign a rate need to it and then try to achieve that. And what you heard, Greg say, is what we did, on the small end, was the function of deliberate execution, given where the returns are. So you got that factor, you\u2019ve got workers\u2019 comp, you\u2019ve got all sorts of things that will drive the headline number. As a reminder though, we\u2019re really executing on account by account basis.\nSarah DeWitt: Okay, thank you.\nGabriella Nawi: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nYaron Kinar: Hi, good morning everybody. First question on Business Insurance and renewal rate change there. So just given the momentum you\u2019ve seen months over months during the quarter and the fact that less of your workers\u2019 comp or I guess less of the renewals will be workers\u2019 comp waited. And the remaining three quarters of the year, would it be fair to expect maybe for the acceleration of the rate change?\nAlan Schnitzer: I\u2019m not sure we agree with the workers\u2019 comp waiting observation by the way. I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s going to be a significant driver. And this in terms of outlook, Yaron, we give you a perspective in the Outlook sections of the 10-Q and we\u2019re probably not going to go beyond that. So I hope that\u2019s helpful.\nYaron Kinar: With regards to waiting, I was just referring to the 37% of workers\u2019 comp renews in the first quarter as opposed to 20 some the rest of the year. And I guess, the other question I had was just with regards to the large non-cat weather losses. So if those remain at the level we\u2019ve seen this quarter. Are you still comfortable with the guidance outlook for the year in terms of margin improvement in Business Insurance?\nAlan Schnitzer: The guidance that we give you, one is an underlying basis, so it excludes cats. And two, we do say exclusively in the 10-Q, that it assumes a return to lower more normal levels of whether and other loss activity. So we are assuming a return to more normal levels.\nYaron Kinar: Okay, thank you very much.\nGabriella Nawi: And this will be our last question please.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. So drilling down on the Business Insurance pricing just little bit more here. Can you talk about how you\u2019ve kind of saw \u2013 it improved I guess, month-to-month you said. But if you were thinking about kind of what the pricing environment look like. We had your fourth quarter conference call to today. Is it in line, better, worse than you kind of we\u2019re expecting it to competitive pressures maybe a little bit more or less?\nAlan Schnitzer: It\u2019s probably finer than we want to parse it. We start getting into competitively sensitive information there. So that\u2019s probably finer than we want to parse it. I did say in my remarks that we did achieve rate gains more broadly across accounts. That\u2019s true and that\u2019s a trend that \u2013 I think it was quarter-to-quarter throughout the year and probably going back five quarters or so. So I will share that color, but parsing it beyond that probably more detail than we want to provide.\nBrian Meredith: Great. And then last question here. If I look at the exposure change and you\u2019ve talked about how that exposure change, there\u2019s part of it that actually has an impact on margins. Is there kind of a general kind of percentage of that, that we should think as part of margins? Is it half of it? Is it two-thirds of it?\nAlan Schnitzer: We\u2019ve always resisted and giving that, because there\u2019s so much estimation involved. So all we said is that it\u2019s not insignificant, but we\u2019ve stopped sort of really quantifying that.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks. Keep it to try, thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks you.\nGabriella Nawi: Okay, thank you all for joining us today. And it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you all over the last 10 years. And I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll hear from you again soon. Have a great day, and thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines."}], "2020": [{"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 4, "year": 2019, "date": "2020-01-23 15:10:06", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the Q&A session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on January 23, 2020. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers discussion of our fourth quarter 2019 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast earnings presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the earnings presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported a record quarterly core income per diluted share of $3.32. Core return on equity was 14.8%. As you've heard us say before, the primary measure we use to manage our business is core return on equity over time and any strategy to deliver industry-leading returns requires a strategy to grow, also over time. For the full year 2019, we are very pleased that the continued successful execution of our strategy to grow the top-line at attractive returns resulted in record net written premiums of more than $29 billion. Looking back over the last three years, our cumulative top-line growth and its impact on our results are significant. Earned premiums were more than $3.5 billion higher in 2019 compared to 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate of nearly 5%. That volume has made a meaningful contribution to underwriting income. We have a very high-quality book of business and we're pleased that retentions have remained high across the board in recent years. Premium growth in 2019 and over the past three years has been driven by higher pricing with both pure rate and exposure growth contributing. The new business we\u2019ve added has been in products, industries, and geographies that we know well. So, we're growing with confidence. Improvements in productivity and efficiency complement the benefit of volume. This quarter, our expense ratio improved to 29.1%, bringing our full-year expense ratio to 29.6%. That marches a steady and substantial improvement over the past three years from an expense ratio, which prior to that had averaged around 32%. This was driven by our efforts to leverage technology investments and workflow enhancements.  Importantly, at the same time, we also continue to make strategic investments in our business, grow our investment portfolio, and return substantial excess capital to our shareholders. Achieving further productivity and efficiency gains continues to be a strategic priority for us. As you\u2019ve heard us say, improved operating leverage gives us the flexibility to invest further in our strategic priorities, let the benefit fall to the bottom-line, and/or be more competitive on pricing, without compromising our return objectives. Over the course of this past year, our results were also impacted by headwinds from a challenging tort environment. Greg will comment on the impact in the current quarter, but I\u2019ll note that we continue to believe that social inflation is an environmental issue driven primarily by a more aggressive plaintiffs\u2019 bar. For the full year, core income exceeded $2.5 billion, generating core return on equity of 10.9%. Considering the challenging tort environment and persistent low interest rates, that level of profit and return speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified business and our investment expertise.  Our results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 6% during the year to $92.76 after returning $2.4 billion of excess capital to shareholders, consistent with our longstanding capital management strategy. Turning to production, our marketplace execution was excellent, and fourth quarter net written premiums increased by 6% to $7.1 billion, marking the 12th consecutive quarter in which we generated premium growth in all three business segments. Net written premiums in Business Insurance increased 5%. Domestic renewal premium change was 7.8%, including renewal rate change of 5.1%, in both cases the highest level since 2013, while retention remained very strong.  In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 9%, with strong growth in both our management liability and surety businesses. Renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business was 6.6%, up about 2 points over the prior year quarter, and the highest it has been since 2014. Our retention remains historically high at 89%. In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 6%, reflecting growth in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. In our Agency Homeowners business, renewal premium change increased to 7.4%, its highest level since 2014. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom, and Michael about our segment results.  To sum it up, our performance transformed, called to action, served us well this past year. In a challenging environment, we generated a nearly 11% core return on equity. We also made important investments broadly across our value chain advancing our ambitious innovation agenda. We digitized sales and service capabilities, improved workflows to increase speed responsiveness, rolled out new products, implemented new analytic capabilities, and put claims related digital tools in the hands of our customers and claim professionals, just to name a few. All of these and other important initiatives are part of our coordinated efforts to deliver on three priorities aimed to positioning Travelers for continued success well into the future, namely extending our lead in risk expertise, providing great experiences to our customers, agents, brokers, and employees, and optimizing productivity and efficiency.  With our relentless focus on execution, deep and talented team, sophisticated analytical approach to underwriting, and high degree of respect for our shareholders\u2019 capital, we are well positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $867 million, up from $571 million in the prior year quarter; and core ROE was 14.8%, up from 10%. The improvement in both measures from last year's fourth quarter resulted primarily from a lower level of catastrophe losses.  Our fourth quarter results include $85 million of pre-tax cat losses, which consists of $186 million of cat events, partially offset by $101 million of cat recoveries under the new treaty. Recall that under that treaty, we were reinsured for 86% of the losses above $1.3 billion retention, and that through the third quarter we had accumulated $1.2 billion towards that retention. PYD in the current quarter, for which I'll provide more details shortly, was net favorable $60 million pre-tax. The underlying combined ratio of 92.1%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, increased by 1 point from the prior year quarter. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $538 million was down modestly from $578 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting a higher loss level associated with ongoing challenges related to the more aggressive tort environment, partially offset by the volume benefit from higher levels of premium. The fourth quarter expense ratio of 29.1% brings the full year expense ratio to 29.6%. These results reflect the progress we've made in our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency in recent years and this is our lowest full year expense ratio since 2005. After-tax net investment income decreased slightly from the prior year quarter to $525 million as increases in fixed income were more than offset by lower returns in our non-fixed income portfolio.  In 2020, we expect that fixed income NII will decrease by approximately $5 million to $10 million after-tax per quarter compared to the corresponding periods of 2019 as we projected the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio given a lower interest rate environment. All three segments reported modest net favorable prior year reserve development in the fourth quarter. In Personal Insurance, both auto and property performed better than expected for multiple accident years. In Bond & Specialty, we experienced better than expected loss development in the fidelity and surety line. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD included about $140 million of better than expected loss experience in workers\u2019 comp and unfavorable development in the general liability and commercial multi-peril lines.  When our combined 2019 Schedule P is filed early in the second quarter, we expect the results to be consistent with our commentary throughout the year, with strengthening in the commercial liability lines and favorability in workers\u2019 comp, fidelity and surety and the personal lines coverages. Page 22 of the earnings presentation provides information about our January 1st capture year renewals. Our longstanding corporate cat XOL treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses for multiple cat events. As you know, for 2019, we added a new property aggregate to catastrophe XOL treaty.  First, let me take a moment to summarize the impact of that treaty on our 2019 results. For the full year, as expected, the treaty increased our underlying combined ratio by about 0.5 point. The treaty had essentially no impact on the full year's total combined ratio as the impact on the underlying combined ratio was virtually offset by the benefit of cat recoveries under the treaty, also very much in line with our assumptions. Because we did not surpass our retention level until the fourth quarter, that's when we began to recognize recoveries under the treaty. So the impact on the fourth quarter specifically was a benefit to the total combined ratio of more than 1 point, and there was virtually no impact on the underlying combined ratio.  As renewed for 2020, this treaty will continue to address from dollar one qualifying PCS designated events in North America for which we incur losses of $5 million or more, providing aggregate coverage of $280 million part of $500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of $1.55 billion. The aggregate retention for 2020 increased from last year\u2019s $1.3 billion, largely reflecting recent year\u2019s and anticipated growth in our property book. Hurricane and earthquake events once again have a $250 million per occurrence cap.  Since we placed the lower percentage of the treaty than last year, the cost of the treaty will be proportionally lower in 2020. So incorporating our assumptions about cat and non-cat weather for 2020, we would expect a full year impact on our underlying combined ratio to be slightly less than the roughly 0.5 point we experienced in 2019. And we would once again anticipate only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio.  Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.4 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.4 billion. For the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $5 billion, our highest level since 2007, which was an unusually light cat year loss. Interest rates increased modestly during the fourth quarter, and accordingly our net unrealized investment gain decreased from $2.4 billion after-tax as of September 30th to $2.2 billion after-tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses was $92.76 at year end, 6% higher than at the beginning of the year. We returned $588 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $376 million and dividends of $212 million. For the year, we returned $2.4 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Finally, on a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 23 of the earnings presentation. As we enter 2020, we thought it would be helpful to point out the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade. As you can see, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. Cat losses in the second quarter have been about twice as much as any other quarter on average, and the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in six of the past 10 years.  And now I will turn the microphone over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $448 million of segment income, a 15% increase over the fourth quarter of 2018. That brings the full year total for segment income to almost $1.4 billion. Earnings for both the quarter and the year benefited from strong profitability and workers\u2019 compensation, our largest product line, as well as higher overall business volumes and a lower expense ratio as we continue to execute on our strategy of growing the top-line at attractive returns and improving our operating leverage.  The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 96.4%, 1 point higher than the fourth quarter of 2018. We've included information on Slide 9 of the earnings presentation that details the components of the change. As you can see on the slide, there's about one-third of 1 point of net unfavorable impact from items that rolled forward from prior quarters. There's also a about 1 point of net unfavorable impact from items that are new in the fourth quarter, including about 0.5 point associated with additional changes in our general liability and commercial auto loss estimates. And along with that, the current quarter includes about 1.5 point related to the estimation of the first three quarters of the year.  For the full year, the underlying combined ratio of 96.2% was 0.5 point higher than the full year 2018. Slide 10 of the earnings presentation provides a detailed view of the various items impacting the year-over-year results. Before turning to the top-line and production, I'll provide a little more context on the tort environment in our international loss activity. Regarding the tort environment, to get our best view of the escalating loss costs, we've leveraged our leading data and analytics, and importantly, the tight feedback loop among our business leaders, underwriters, claim professionals and actuaries. We have a carefully underwritten book of business with largely a mainstream orientation, which we have targeted, grown and optimized for years.  More than 90% of our domestic policies have limits of $2 million or less. Excluding workers\u2019 compensation, the limits don't apply. While we will continue to pursue claim strategies and underwriting actions to mitigate the impacts from the worsening tort environment, our primary action will be to seek more rate. During the quarter, we were once again successful in achieving meaningful improvement in renewal rate change while maintaining very high levels of retention, which is evidence that we're not alone in driving rate. All of that is consistent with our view that what we're experiencing is environmental. As for international, we've been experiencing elevated losses in the property lines. We're pursuing and achieving significant renewal rate increases to address these trends, as you can see within the international production statistics on Page 20 of the earnings presentation. In addition to that, we're executing a variety of profit improvement initiatives, including tightening terms and conditions, and pairing back exposures of certain lines and accounts. While more work needs to be done, we're making good progress with all of these efforts. Turning to the top-line, net written premiums were up 5% in the quarter and 4% for the full year driven by strong production results. While renewal premium change continues to be the largest contributor, we also grew our customer base for the year through strong retention and new business. We're pleased with the continued progress we're making on our strategic initiatives and remain encouraged by the feedback from our agent and broker partners. In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 7.8%, with renewal rate change of 5.1%, while retention remains high at 84%, a reflection of the quality of our book. The renewal rate change of 5.1% was the highest result since the fourth quarter of 2013 and was up seven-tenths of 1 point from the third quarter and more than 3.5 points from the fourth quarter of last year. This demonstrates our continued momentum notwithstanding the downward pressure in workers\u2019 compensation pricing.  We are achieving higher rate levels broadly across our book with above three quarters of our middle market accounts getting positive rate increases this quarter, which is up from about two-thirds in the fourth quarter of last year.  A further illustration of the broad nature of our progress is on Slide 14 of the earnings presentation.  For our core commercial accounts business, the slide reflects the percentage of renewed accounts in three rate bands for the fourth quarter of 2017, 2018 and 2019. As you can see from the graph, the percentage of accounts renewing flat or with the rate decrease has declined, while the percentage of accounts renewing with the rate increase is up, with the level of rate increase skewed higher. In other words, a higher proportion of our accounts are getting a rate increase, and a higher proportion of our accounts are getting a more significant rate increase, and this progress has been achieved while retention has remained at historically high levels.  From a line of business perspective, outside of workers\u2019 compensation we achieved higher rate increases in all lines as compared to both the third quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year. For the segment, new business of $488 million was strong and consistent with the prior year quarter. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change of 7.2% and renewal rate change of 1.9% were both up from the third quarter and from the fourth quarter of last year, while retention remained strong at 83%.  New business of $105 million was consistent with a strong prior year quarter. We continued to advance our investments related to product development and ease of doing business and are encouraged with the progress and results to-date. In middle market, renewal premium change was 7.1%, with renewal rate change of 5%, up more than 1 point from the third quarter, and more than 3.5 points from the fourth quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 86%. New business of $284 million was up slightly from the prior year quarter bringing the full year total to just over $1.2 billion, reflecting higher new business pricing as well as benefits from our ongoing strategic initiatives.  To sum up, the fourth quarter wrapped up the year in which a lot of things went well and we faced some challenges, most notably the continued pressure from the tort environment. We are confident that we have the insights and capabilities to a changing environment that will position us well in the market in 2020 and beyond. We couldn't be more pleased with our local execution and we will continue to see great and use all other available levers to meet our return objectives.  Before I turn the call over to Tom to talk about Bond & Specialty result, I want to comment on our outlook for renewal premium change and underlying underwriting results since we will not be filing our 10-K for a few weeks. For Business Insurance we expect RPC in 2020 will be higher than 2019. We expect the underlying combined ratio for the full year 2020 will be lower than in 2019. This assumes the anticipated impact of earned pricing in excess of loss cost trends and improved results in our international business.  Underneath that full year outlook we expect the improvements in the underlying combined ratio to come in the second through fourth quarters of the year as the first quarter of 2020 will include the roll forward impacts of the actions we took in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 for the general liability and commercial auto product lines.  With that, I'll turn the call over the Tom. \nTom Kunkel : Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong returns and growth. Segment income was $167 million, a decrease of $53 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The combined and underwriting combined -- underlying combined ratios remained strong at 78.6% and 81.3%, respectively. The underlying combined ratio increased 3.2 points from the prior year quarter, largely reflecting the impact of the roll forward of higher loss estimates for management liability coverages that we discussed with you last quarter. The underlying underwriting gain was slightly lower than the prior year quarter as the earned impact of higher business volumes largely offset the higher underlying combined ratio. Turning to top-line, net written premiums were up 9% for the quarter, reflecting growth across all our businesses. In our domestic management liability business, we are pleased that the retention remained at a very strong 89% with renewal premium change higher at 6.6%. These production results are consistent with our strategy to maintain strong retention of our high-quality portfolio while executing targeted pricing actions. We will continue to pursue price increases, where warranted. Domestic management liability new business for the quarter increased 17% to $62 million and domestic surety and our international business, both posted solid growth in the quarter. We remain pleased with our strong field execution and our strategic long-term investments and market-leading products and services together with our commitment to thoughtful and disciplined underwriting and risk selection. So, Bond & Specialty results remained strong, and we feel terrific about our ability to continue to deliver top-line growth with strong returns over time.  In terms of our 2020 outlook, we expect RPC for our domestic management liability business will be higher and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly higher in each case as compared to 2019.  Additionally, for 2020, we expect that the underlying underwriting margin will be broadly consistent with 2019, as the impact of higher business volumes will offset the slightly higher underwriting -- underlying combined ratio. And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income was $327 million and the combined ratio was 88.5%. For the full year, segment income of $824 million, an improvement of $527 million from the prior year and the combined ratio was 94.2%. The results for both periods reflect solid improvements from the prior year, driven by significantly lower catastrophes. Underwriting income also benefited from higher levels of earned premium. Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full year was 6% and 5% respectively, with continued strong retention, renewal premium change and new business. Agency Automobile delivered solid results in the quarter with a combined ratio of 99.2% and was typically our highest combined ratio quarter for the line. The 3.9 point increase relative to the prior period is largely reflective of the unusually low level of losses in the fourth quarter of 2018. The full-year combined ratio was an outstanding 94%, which was comparable to the prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 94.6% improved 0.7 points, benefiting from earned pricing that exceeded loss trends in the first half of the year, as well as favorable frequency throughout 2019.  In Agency Homeowners and Other, fourth quarter combined ratio of 75.8% improved by 34 points in comparison to the prior year quarter, which was significantly impacted by catastrophes, specifically the California wildfires and Hurricane Michael. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was 73.6%, or 1.1 points higher than the prior year quarter, driven by a higher non-weather loss activity. The full year 2019 combined ratio was an excellent 92.5% as lower catastrophe losses drove a 13.1 point improvement from the prior year. The underlying combined ratio was up 4 points to 85.6% for the year, due primarily to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, and the impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. As we've discussed with you previously, we continue to take pricing and underwriting actions to address higher levels of underlying loss activity.  Shifting to quarterly production, Agency Automobile net written premiums grew 2% with modest growth in new business and policies enforced, while retention remains strong at 84% and renewal premium change was 2.9%. We continue to make progress in our efforts to grow this profitable line. Agency Homeowners and Other delivered another strong quarter with net written premium growth of 13%, driven by higher new business levels, retention at 86% and renewal premium change rising to 7.4%, double the level from the prior year quarter.  We remain pleased with the rollout of our Quantum Home 2.0 product, which is now available on 34 states and the District of Columbia. Quantum Home 2.0 has granular pricing segmentation, customizable coverages and ease of quoting, combines a form a solution that is both sophisticated and simple and our increased quote volume and higher average premiums suggested hitting the mark with both agents and customers.  Turning to our outlook, we expect that for 2020 compared to 2019 Agency Homeowners and Other renewal premium changes will be higher, while Agency Automobile renewal premium changes will remain positive but be lower. The underlying combined ratios for both Agency Homeowners and Other and for the Personal Insurance segment as a whole will be lower. This improvement is expected in the second through fourth quarters of the year, assuming lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses. For Agency Automobile the outlook is for the underlying combined ratio to be broadly consistent.  All-in it was a very good year for Personal Insurance with a second consecutive year of strong profitability in auto and strong and significantly improved homeowners profitability. In addition, we achieved record levels of domestic net written premiums, new business and policies enforced. We have strong momentum going into 2020 and are well positioned to deliver profitable growth, while investing in capabilities that will continue to enhance the value of our franchise. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe. \nAbbe Goldstein : Thanks, Michael. And we're ready to take your questions now. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips : My first question -- I'm thinking about Slide 9, and especially at the bottom of Slide 9. I know you guys talked about kind of longer-term trends of 4% to 4.5% that gives 4.5% last time. I know you focus on long-term trends. But you\u2019ve moved that up a bit in the last couple quarters more on kind of a catch up which you again referred to here on Slide 9. So, I'm wondering if you still think that 4.5% is something you're comfortable with or how you think about that going forward now?\nDan Frey: Hi, Michael, it\u2019s Dan Frey. So, I'll draw the distinction between sort of the long-term trend assumption and what's going to roll through any particular quarter or any year. So, in that slide, we're reconciling for you the difference between last year's combined ratio and this year's combined ratio. And clearly for the year as a whole, when we look at the change in the loss environment overall, it was more than 4.5%. We did remember to raise our view of the long-term trend. I think we talked about that back in the second quarter, but we haven't changed it since then. So, these are more reactions to data that we're seeing in the current environment, raising the level of losses but not the trajectory from this point forward. \nMichael Phillips : Okay. I mean, I guess obviously what I'm getting to is a tug of war between pricing and loss trends, kind of who wins in the tug of war right now. And obviously, this quarter the tug of war went to loss trends because margins were down. A lot of your commentary talks about the outlook being better for the underlying. Certainly, I think you said starting in the second quarter, so you're still thinking that pricing -- earned pricing will get better than loss trends as we get into the back half of this year, it sounds like. Is that what you're saying?\nDan Frey: Yes, that's full year. So remember, the outlook is really a 12 month broad view of what we think the environment is going to be as opposed to a quarter-by-quarter reconciliation. The comment Greg made is that when we compare Q1 in particular of '20 to Q1 of '19, the strengthening that we've done for 2019 came in Q2, Q3 and Q4 primarily. So that comparison in and of itself is going to be a little different than the year more broadly.\nAlan Schnitzer: Micheal, it\u2019s Alan. I would also just encourage you to make sure you're looking at Slide 10 too. Because there is a lot of moving pieces in Slide 9 that when you look at it on a full year basis, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a little bit of an easier view to take in.\nMichael Phillips: Yes. Okay. No, thank you. My second question is, I guess, I appreciate the color year guys gave on the Business Insurance PYD, $140 million you talked about for comp, that was helpful. I guess on the CMP piece, I assume the adverse there was on the liability side of CMP. I just want to confirm that. And then, if so, I guess what's driving that? Are you seeing kind of -- is that more of kind of tort environment leaking down from GL into the smaller accounts of CMP liability or kind of what's driving that piece?\nDan Frey: Yes, Michael. It's Dan again. So, I'd say broadly, yes. And I\u2019d remind you that if you go back and look at the results we've disclosed throughout the year, even going back to Q1 of this year, we did talk about CMP as being an unfavorable contributor to prior year reserve development and BI even going back to Q1. And clearly, as you are alluding to CMP has got both a property and a liability component, it is the liability component. But as we've made comments over the second, third, and now fourth quarters of this year, when we talk about the liability environment in Business Insurance, that for us is meant to include the liability component of CMP as opposed to this being something new and different.\nOperator: Your next question is from Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery.\nLarry Greenberg: I guess I'm just asking a qualitative question. Where you sit today or feel today versus where things stood coming out of the third quarter, obviously you are pushing -- this is all about Business Insurance, obviously, you're pushing price to some extent, you're shooting at a moving target with loss trend and all the issues surrounding that. Is there -- you've got -- you\u2019ve now got another quarter just looking back to from the third, is there any way to say that you are more comfortable with where you sit today and what you're seeing and how the relationship with pricing and loss trend is moving? Just looking for some qualitative thoughts on that.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Larry. It's Alan. Let me take a stab at that. So, first I would say, we're definitely pleased with the trajectory rate versus loss trend. That continues to be a good story. And importantly, you got to look at retention in that regard, that's hanging in there which suggests we think this is an environmental thing and we would say that the pricing actions have room to go here. In terms of our overall sense of the balance sheet, we are closer to the end of this than we were a year ago, that's for sure. And what we're very confident in is, we're confident in the talent we\u2019ve got looking at this. We're confident in our processes. We're confident in our data and analytics, and we are confident that we understand the environment out there. So, very confident in our best estimate. Can we tell you this is the end of it? Of course not. We couldn't and nobody could. But that I don't need to imply any lack of confidence in, again the data analytics people process here. This is an environmental issue and we think we're on top of it. \nLarry Greenberg : And then just as a follow-up. You talk about the other levers that you might have in addition to pricing. Are you willing to share any of those other levers to go at this environmental issue?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, certainly because it is environmental, just the playbooks as you go to rate, that's just the way you solve those issues. Now, anytime you have a circumstance like this, and frankly, anytime in any book of business, we're always looking to optimize. We're always pulling books of business apart in understanding where there are opportunities to improve. And that's true in our best performing businesses and our worst performing businesses.  So you go through that process, and there are always things that we can do better and we will do those things. When we look at this environment in particular, relative to our overall book of business, there are around the edges accounts or segments of the business that we think in the current environment don't make sense. And we'll either get the right rate or we'll get off them. And then probably to the question you\u2019re really asking is, what we're doing from a claim perspective. And clearly, the plaintiffs\u2019 bar is getting more sophisticated, more clever, more aggressive. And I guess in response to that, I would say so are we. I'm not anxious to detail our tactics or strategies. I think that would probably be unwise for us to do that. But we've got a very large and very sophisticated claim operation, lawyers\u2019 litigation strategy. And so we will employ all those levers as well.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: I had a couple of questions. First, just on the tort environment overall, you've been more vocal than most other companies. Just trying to understand, is the environment stabilizing or has it gotten worse as you went through 2019? And then the other question I just had is on your expense ratio, which was very good for the year. And for the quarter, to what extent is it sustainable versus sort of being an aberration? \nAlan Schnitzer: I'll start with the tort environment and then I'll ask Dan to talk about the expense ratio. Clearly, I think if you look at our results throughout the year, we would say, I don't know if the environment has gotten worse but clearly the losses have come in worse than our expectations. And one thing you got to remember is we are setting reserves for years in various long-term lines of business, where there is a very high percentage of IBNR.  So the paid in cases are a relatively small percentage of this. And so we're squaring triangles. We're looking at the data that comes in every quarter, comparing to our expectations. And that's what has gotten worse. And I will say, quarter in, quarter out, we have not responded gingerly. We have responded assertively to this and yet it's continued to come in a little bit worse than our expectations.  But as I said before, we are five quarters closer to the end of this than we were a year ago. And again, we think we understand the market dynamics. We think we understand what's causing this. And we feel very good about our analytics and our process. Dan, you want to talk about the expense ratio?\nDan Frey: Sure. So, focusing on the full year, because there's going to be a little bit of variability from quarter-to-quarter. So, 29.6% for the full year, that's a range we're comfortable with now. Certainly, noticeably, better than it was several years ago and steady progress over the last three years. I think everything comes back to the way we talk about the business consistently, which is we're trying to optimize returns over time. There's not really a specific targeted expense ratio. Although in the current environment the level that we're at now is a level that plus or minus we're pretty comfortable with in this environment. We've been able to get productivity and efficiency gains. And at the same time, we've been able to make the investments in the business that we think to make for our success going forward. And we will always balance those things. The fact that it\u2019s come out at 29.6 for the year feels good. And this is a level that we're pretty comfortable with in this environment.\nJimmy Bhullar : And if I can ask one more just on personal auto, I think you mentioned you expect margins to be stable in 2020. But if we look over the past couple of years, the pace of price hikes has actually steadily slowed. And it seems like for the industry that's worse than this loss cost inflation. So what gives you the confidence that margins in personal auto won't get worse in 2020?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Jimmy, this is Michael Klein. I would say a couple of things. One, most of the rhetoric in industry about loss trend deterioration focuses on severity, which is a piece of the puzzle. And we certainly are observing some of the same dynamics in terms of collision and physical damage severity that you're seeing folks talk about as well as bodily injury severity. On the good news front has been frequency. And as I mentioned, we continue to see favorable frequency better than our expectations sort of throughout 2019. And we put those frequency and severity results together with a longer term view of loss trend. And view loss trend as actually an aggregate relatively consistent going into 2020. And then the lower renewal premium change outlook is again on the margin. And again, lower but continued positive.  And so that's where we land on broadly consistent. And again, I think much like Greg's commentary in Personal Insurance rate versus last trend is one dynamic that drives you to your outlook for a combined ratio. But the other levers that you use to manage the business, including underwriting, terms, conditions, claim process, claim efficiencies, come into that view of the outlook as well. So it's not just a linear roll forward of rate versus loss trend getting it to that answer.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.\nMike Zaremski: Sticking with the tort environments first. Is it more pronounced, any geographies or maybe by employer size? And probably the number one question I get is, could this -- could we still be in the early innings of this upwards trend? I don't know if there's a way to frame historically how high year-over-year tort inflation has gotten in the past. Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, thanks for question, Mike. So you could look at any one quarter and there may be a pocket of heat in terms of geography or business or line. But I think the right way to answer that question is to take a step back and look at the last year. And when we take a step back and look at the last year, we would say it's been broadly across our casualty coverages, geographically, line of business, and so on and so forth.  I would point out that a vast majority of the business we write has 500 or fewer employees. And as Greg mentioned, more than 90% of our policies have a limit of $2 million or less. So, I would say this is a relatively broad-based phenomenon is the way to think about it.  Now, yes about relative to history, we had other liability environmental I'll say over last decade or two. But -- and there's some people out there that try to compare them. I don't know that you really can compare them, just the facts and circumstances are different. You\u2019ve got companies that have different books of business. We've got -- all of us have different data and analytics available to us. But I think most importantly, if you look at prior liability environments I\u2019ll call them, those have largely been driven by medical inflation. This one is driven by social inflation. And I'm not aware in recent history of another environment where distributed social inflation has been the driver. \nMike Zaremski: And my last question is regarding Slide 23 in the deck on the historical catastrophe losses. Would you say that over the last decade or so, Hurricane losses in the U.S. have been less than expected. I am basically trying to get at, should the 3Q or maybe 4Q cat load look a little differently, if we\u2019re thinking about this on a forward basis?\nDan Frey: Mike, it\u2019s Dan. I'm not quite sure how to answer that question. What you're seeing here is our numbers. And for sure the point I think we're trying to make here is, our experience -- and this includes as a result of underwriting actions taken over the previous 10 to 15 years to really sort of move the mix of our book so that it's less coastal than it was a decade or more than that ago. So there's been a lot of industry commentary around hurricane. I don't know that anybody feels that there's any less exposure to hurricanes broadly now than there was two years ago, five years ago or 10 years ago. I think as a percentage of where our risks are, we\u2019ve probably on a relative basis mitigated our hurricane risk compared to the other risks. And I think that's really the point we're trying to make in this slide is that second quarter for us has been the issue, which is not aligned with the traditional hurricane, not because I think on a macro basis the hurricane environment is more benign. I don't really have an opinion on that. We're just telling you, in our book based on where we write and the exposures we have, this is what our result looks like over the past 10 years.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, yes, I guess I'll follow up because it still feels like on a forward basis that since we're not going to where there have been -- there's been less hurricane activity. I think the street definitely has 3Q being a little more pronounced and it sounds like they\u2019re saying maybe we should weight it a little differently. But I'll follow-up. Thank you for the insights. \nAlan Schnitzer: Mike, I'll just add. That's definitely why we provided the slide. We look at models and we scratch our heads a little bit and obviously we don't know what 2020 is going to look like or 2021 or any other year, right. We have no idea where the volatility could come from. But certainly when we think about how -- what our assumptions are and what our plans are, our starting point is the last 10 years and we think it's relevant for thinking about this year and future years.\nOperator: Your next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: I think this is a question for Greg. Within the BI segment middle market, the delta between renewal premium and renewal rate change was the smallest it\u2019s been in some time. Is there something going on with exposure units there that is worth noting or is that just quarterly fluctuation?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey, Meyer. This is Greg. Yes, that's just quarterly fluctuation. You can see the exposure is down a little bit over the last two quarters, and we do a lot of unpacking on that trying to understand that, individual accounts or broad economic activity, and we think it's more the latter. If you compare the economic activity in the back half of this year to 2018, it's linear with what we're seeing on the exposure change.\nMeyer Shields: And then for Michael, really quickly, you talked about the combined ratio, I want to say for personal lines improving assuming or reflecting a return to normalized non-cat weather. Is that just a regression to the mean or is that a reflection of claims actions or underwriting changes?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Meyer, I appreciate the question. I would say two things. One, we do say that it reflects lower and more normalized expectation for a non-cat weather that doesn't mean a reversion to the mean, it means lower expectation than we saw in 2018. And as we've been talking about 2018 was what -- I'm sorry 2019, what we've been talking about is non-cat weather has been elevated in 2019. We have an expectation in 2020. That's lower than the 2019 level, but importantly, continues to reflect updated estimates and an updated view of non-cat weather loss activity which has been rising. So I wouldn't want you to assume that the assumption in that outlook is the same assumption we had two or three or four years ago. And in fact, it includes more loss content than it would have two or three or four years ago. And so we see margin in the segment and margins in Agency Homeowners and Other improving despite the fact that we have a higher view of the non-cat weather loss content in that outlook than we would have had a year ago or two years ago.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, a couple questions here for you. First one, curious, any update with respect to kind of reviver statutes given we've seen some other states expand or open the statute limitations?\nDan Frey: Hey, Brian. It's Dan. Yes. So in the quarter, again, a modest amount of reserve activity in our PYD number related to revivers, not big enough to have been called out but we saw California enact reviver, this quarter I think North Carolina as well. California is one that gets a lot of attention, it's a big -- obviously a big state and a very active legal environment.  But remember, or in case you don't remember, California had once before open to reviver. And so that goes into our consideration there. So, there has been activity pretty steadily throughout the year. First quarter was the most notable for us and we talked about it then, but there's been modest activity following that and that did occur again in the fourth quarter. \nBrian Meredith: Great. And then second question just quickly on workers\u2019 comp. I mean you've noted and others have noted the really favorable loss cost environments there that is obviously offsetting some of the rate reductions that we're seeing. Would you expect that to continue going into 2020, is that kind of your expectations given the low unemployment environment? Although we\u2019ve seen a pickup in medical cost inflation? \nAlan Schnitzer: Is your question whether we expect PYD to continue in workers\u2019 comp? \nBrian Meredith: No, no, no, just the loss trend environment with respect to workers\u2019 compensation, not so much PYD but just very favorable trends we're seeing kind of frequency trends and comps as well as severity, which is I guess at kind of average?\nAlan Schnitzer: The trends have been favorable. We generally assume a reversion to a longer term mean there. So we don't assume that all the favorability will continue. I mean there has been a very long-term improvement in overall workers\u2019 comp frequency. So we\u2019ve certainly taken into account, but results have been even better than that. And we don't necessarily assume that's going to continue. Medical inflation the severity side has been pretty benign as well. And similarly, we tend to think that these things revert. \nOperator: The next question is from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis : I guess this one is just for Alan and going back to the commentary on thinking we're close to the end than the beginning. So we've had the same charges in the past few quarters. This one is bigger than one we saw in 3Q. Starting with maybe some sense of when you took this charge or these tweaks that you made, how does that give you more comfort? Is there more IBNR in these than have been in the past? Like where are we at now relative to the third quarter that gives you confidence in saying that?\nAlan Schnitzer: Well, it's another quarter to another data point. It's -- every time you get a little bit more data, you get a little bit better view on where the environment is. And so, from that perspective, we feel better. I can't look at it and tell you where the first, second or third quarters of next year is coming in. So from that perspective, there continues to be some uncertainty. But we're in other quarter into it. And frankly, we're five quarters into it.  And so the view we've developed over five quarters, our view of the environment every quarter, we dig into our book a little bit more and test our hypotheses. And all that gives us a little bit more confidence. I don't -- I'm not -- I can't comment about what's going to happen in the first quarter. We just don't know yet, Ryan. \nRyan Tunis : So when you think about your -- I guess outlook for 2020 in terms of hopefully improving Business Insurance margins, do you still think it's -- if you were to achieve that, do you still think that would be a result of the tort environment? Or you think you would have more to do with pricing or execution or something on other fronts?\nAlan Schnitzer: I mean, obviously, any of those things could be a contributor. Certainly social inflation continues to be a risk factor and some uncertainty for us. But any of those things could be a contributor. We feel -- as I said, we've got confidence in our processes. We -- our objective is always to get this number right. We price and reserve based on one view of loss costs. And so, it's important to us to try to get it right. And so we think we've done that.\nOperator: Your next question is from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: I want to ask about commission rates. We've seen with anecdotal data that there's some pretty high commissions being paid for workers\u2019 comp. Allstate is changing its personal line -- it's private passenger auto and personal lines, commissions. Is Travelers doing anything broadly too as others are changing commission rates?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, I would say broadly our commission rates are reasonably stable. So, no. \nPaul Newsome : And then on the -- back to material thing. Do you have the ability or is it feasible to lower limits and with that, in your view, really on an industry wise basis be one of the possible fixes for this outside of rate. Because there's more issues on -- the higher the limits, the more of the legal involvement? \nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, I mean let me just go back and highlight a comment Greg made in his prepared remarks and I just referenced in 90% or so of our policies in liability lines ex-workers\u2019 comp have policy limited $2 million or less. So I don't think it's -- there's been a lot of industry observers that have commented on this relationship between the loss environment and the limits profile. We just don't think that's true. There's plenty of activity on the smaller accounts.  We haven't -- and we haven't seen the industry necessarily move to changing the limits profile. We think our customers are out there and they need a certain level of protection to manage their businesses and we intend to help them manage their risk in their businesses. We just got to charge the right price for it. And so, solving this through broadly changing limits profiles is probably not the answer.\nOperator: Your next question is from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research.\nAmit Kumar: Two follow-up questions. The first question goes back to Brian's question on CVA. Does your Business Insurance outlook contemplate any potential action from CVA down the road because by the time we get to the back half of 2020 some of those reviver windows will start closing?\nDan Frey: So Amit, it's Dan. We were aware of the revivers that have been enacted and are open in the periods through which they will close. What we've tried to do in 2019 is look our best estimate of the ultimate loss costs related to that activity regardless of the period of time for which the reviver is open. Obviously, when the windows close, we'll have a more crystallized view of the volume and types of claims that have actually come in. To this point, we haven't seen anything in the activity that's coming that makes us change our view of the reserves related to CVA. Regarding the 2020 outlook in general, our view -- one, our commentary relates to underlying combined ratio, but I'd make the comment that generally speaking, and we\u2019ve said this consistently, we don't anticipate prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable on a go forward basis. We think all the information we have regarding the claim environment, as it exists today, is reflected in our reserves today.\nAmit Kumar: Got it. But the only other question I have is -- and I want to go back to the initial question on CMP. But CMP product is towards the small to mid-sized accounts. The GL product is towards the larger customer account. I'm curious, just going back to the broader discussion on tort environment, would it be fair to say that the adjustments have sort of started from the national accounts related to middle market and then moved on to select or how should we think about that?\nAlan Schnitzer: No, definitely not. It started in commercial auto and I'm looking on -- really I think 99% of our commercial auto policies have policy limits of $2 million or less, I think.\nDan Frey: 1 million actually.\nAlan Schnitzer: 1 million. So this isn't something that started large and moved down. This is something that's started down the small end and spread on the small end?\nAmit Kumar : I just want to understand the directionality of the tort climate, because we\u2019ve consistently heard that the attorney involvement has continued to move down and down and down into the smallest claims, versus the larger claims. That's where I was heading with that question. \nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, and again, that's why we gave you our limits profile and talked about the fact that a vast majority of our commercial lines policies have customers, employees of 500 or fewer. I mean, it's a -- we are a mainstream writer. We've got a middle market and small commercial business. And we are feeling the heat in those policies that have limits of $2 million or less. Now, we did observe a year ago that to a large degree this started in commercial auto. And that made perfect sense to us, because there was a lot of homogeneity to those claims. Those are very easy claims for the times hard to bring. But it did spread to GL, and again, largely on -- not on the national accounts, large in limit size. Those larger accounts have big limits. Those have always had aggressive attorneys on them. What we're seeing now is the attorney participation spreading into across these small caps.\nOperator: Your final question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Just a question for Alan on the tort environment and the losses in BI. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for how far above expectations did the loss experience come in this quarter, compared to last quarter? Was it a smaller amount of deviation versus expectations, compared to last quarter? Has that narrowed over the past five quarters? Just trying to get a sense for how --where we are in terms of seeing more charges here going forward?\nAlan Schnitzer: I\u2019d say, I'm taking a step back and trying to think about the year, which I think is sort of the right way to think about it. Probably the right way to think about it is Slide 10 on a full year basis, I don't I don't really know that the quarter-by-quarter view really use any insight. But maybe the answer to your question is somewhat consistent than what you said.\nDan Frey: I think in broad magnitude we saw bad news in the second quarter. We saw bad news in the third quarter. We saw bad news in the fourth quarter. They weren't noticeably different in terms of the way they felt in terms of magnitude. And if you step back and looked at the full year overall related to the tort environment or social inflation, those things being worse than they had been. We\u2019d say the underlying combined ratio on a full year basis compared to a year ago is probably about full points higher than it was. And when you think about the fact that there has also been an impact in PYD we think about that same thing over the full year basis. It's hard to attribute exactly what drove loss changes. But to the best that we can characterize it and if you not take this to be, there's a very specific science. But based on the data and analytics we have, we\u2019d attribute as probably to the place worth about 2 points of bad news within this year's full year prior reserve development. \nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. And Alan, you had mentioned, just higher attorney involvement, just on the smaller cases -- smaller case sizes. I guess I'm just wondering, I guess just how much has that increased? Like are you are you seeing it now on like 30% versus 20%? Just trying to get a sense for where that is and are you assuming that, that continues to increase in your loss picks?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, so, I don't -- I'm not sure we're going to share the absolute number but I will share with you that the percentage of claims on which we're seeing lawyers has increased by about 10 points over seven years -- over six years with about half of that increase coming in 2019 and 2018. So that sort of gives you a sense of the quantum of the increase over recent years and how much of that has come really in just '19 and '18, half of the increase. One of the reasons why we think it's been such a recent and significant shift. And just to -- yes Abbe is pointing out to me, that's the commercial autos business.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. Do you have any closing remarks?\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much for joining us. And as always, if you have any follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Welcome to the third quarter results teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 22, 2019. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers discussion of our third quarter 2019 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning we reported third quarter net income of $396 million or $1.50 per diluted share. Our core income was $378 million or $1.43 per diluted share. Our results this quarter were impacted by net unfavorable prior year reserve development and business insurance. Continued favorable development in the workers comp lines was more than offset by a strengthening of asbestos-related reserves and reserves in GL and commercial auto lines. As I shared at an Industry Conference last month, GL and Commercial Auto were impacted against quarter by a tort environment that is deteriorated beyond our elevated expectations. As I'll explain in a minute, we remain confident that this is an industry wide issue and that we're responding appropriately to recently emerging data. Underwriting income in the quarter benefited from record high net earned premium of $7.2 billion, driven by higher pricing and strong retention over the last four quarters. Also contributing was a continued execution of our strategy to invest in the capabilities, we believe are required for success given the forces of change we've previously identified as impacting our industry. In addition to investments in talent, technology and workflow, this includes progress in terms of our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. As reflected in our sub thirty expense ratio for both the quarter and year-to-date. As you've heard us say, improved operating leverage gives us a flexibility to invest further in our strategic priorities but the benefit from the bottom line and or be more competitive on pricing, without compromising our return objectives. In terms of the underlying underwriting margin, as you can see on page 4 of our earnings presentation, the underlying combined ratio was solid at 94.1% but up 1.1 points over the prior year quarter. Favorable items impacting the underlying results included improvement in our workers comp loss ratio and as I mentioned continued excellent work, including operating leverage. More than offsetting those items were higher noncatastrophe weather-related losses and headwinds from more challenging tort environment. Dan will provide more detail on the pieces, but I'll spend a minute on the tort environment. The aggregate impact of the adjustments we have made this quarter to reflect our latest view of the tort environment together with those in the second quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, added about two-thirds of a point to the underlying combined ratio on a year-to-date basis. To give you some perspective on the loss environment, on page 21 of the earnings presentation, we have included the chart of ISO data showing a measure of commercial auto bodily injury severity for the industry over the past four years. The full year 2018 data just recently became available. As you can see, during 2018, the observed average paid claim cost shifted significantly, compared to the prior years as well as throughout the year. This view of industry data for other commercial liability coverages is not yet available for 2018, but we believe that the more aggressive tort environment is to one degree or another impacting those as well. While the chart reflects industry data is not Travelers specific, the shaded area of the graph illustrates the challenge we've been addressing as part of our current and prior year reserve in process over the past four quarters, developing a stable view of ultimate losses in this case is made difficult by the magnitude of the shift in the data combined with the fact that, it is so recent, the long-term nature of the exposure and a lengthening of the claim development pattern, which is difficult to assess as it emerges. At the heart of the issue is a higher and more aggressive level of attorney involvement on claims. Taking a step back, we will manage through this, but the bigger issue for all of us is that the broken tort system imposes the tort tax across society. According to a recent study by the Institute for Legal Reform, tort costs amount to approximately 2.3% of U.S. GDP or more than $3200 to your US household, and considerably more than that in some states. There's also evidence that some claimants can be disadvantaged. According to a study by the Insurance Research Council private passenger claimants with attorneys received less on average and settlement from insurers after deducting legal and other related costs as compared to claimants without attorneys. On average, it also takes claimants with attorneys longer to receive payments. Tort reform has been a public policy focus for us and we're stepping up our efforts.  Turning to the top line, our production results were again excellent in the quarter. We grew net written premiums by 7% to $7.6 billion, a record increase of more than $500 million with each of our business segments contributing. Our premium growth reflects high levels of retention and improving annual premium change broadly across the portfolio as well as a higher level of new business. We're growing our business with confidence in terms of accounts, geographies, and industries that we know well.  In business insurance, net written premiums increased 7%, as we achieved renewal premium change to 7.4%, including renewal rate change of 4.3%. In both cases, the highest levels in more than five years. At the same time, we maintain strong retention and grew new business. As you'll hear from Greg new business in our national property business benefited from a level of disruption in the market, as we picked up some accounts on our terms. New business in middle market benefited from success with our business center strategy which you've heard us discuss, and across the board, new business levels benefited from stronger new business pricing.  Environment specialty insurance, net written premiums increased by 13% with strong production across our management liability and surety businesses, including historically high domestic management liability retention with improving renewal premium change in record new business. In personal insurance net written premiums increased by 7%, with agency auto up 3% and agency homeowners up 11% both benefiting from strong productions. Given the headwinds that the industry is facing for continued low interest rates, a challenging level of social inflation, and ongoing uncertainty surrounding weather related losses will continue to seek higher prices and improve terms and conditions. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results.  To sum it up, we feel terrific that the strategy you laid out in 2017 is contributing to top line success in each of our segments. In terms of the bottom line, you would have hoped that the tort environment would not have deteriorated further. So in a business or from time to time loss costs are going to vary from our expectations. As we've explained what's important is recognizing it quickly and taking action. We have a long track record of successfully managing our diversified businesses through challenging circumstances, with insights from leading data and analytics driving our executions, the best talent in the industry and deep relationships with our agents and brokers, who continue to leverage the power of our franchise to deliver industry leading results over time.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan. \nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $378 million down $309 million from the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 6.5%, down from 12%. Both measures reflect the elevated levels of general liability and commercial auto losses that Alan described, which impacted both prior year reserve development and the current action here, as well as an elevated level of non-cat weather losses.  Our third quarter results include $241 million of pre tax cat losses, compared to $264 million in the prior year quarter. Prior year reserve development, which I will discuss further in a few minutes, added 4.1 points to the combined ratio, compared to favorable 0.2 points in last year's third quarter. The consolidated underlying combined ratio of 94.1%, which excludes the impacts of cats in PYD, increased by 1.1 points, driven by elevated general liability, commercial auto and non-cat weather losses, partially offset by favorable experience in workers compensation. The adjustments we made this quarter to reflect our latest view of the tort environment added about half a point to the underlying combined ratio, including a catch-up related to the first and second quarters. In terms of weather, noncatastrophe weather-related losses added about two-thirds of a point to the quarter-over-quarter change in the consolidated underlying combined ratio. For context, total weather losses in the aggregate, cat and non-cat, were somewhat worse in the quarter than what we planned for but year-to-date, total weather losses were well within the range of what we would consider normal. The third quarter expense ratio of 29.5% was in line with recent periods and brings the year-to-date expense ratio to 29.8%, reflecting the terrific progress we've made in recent years. Both the third quarter and year-to-date expense ratios are about 2 points below where they were at this point in 2016. Our third quarter pretax underlying underwriting gain of $386 million declined by 14% as the elevated losses in GL, Commercial Auto and non-cat weather were partially offset by the benefits of higher levels of earned premium and favorable experience in the worker's compensation line. After-tax net investment income decreased by $19 million from the prior year quarter to $528 million. After-tax fixed income NII increased by $17 million as expected and our non-fixed income NII was strong was below last year's results. Fixed income NII benefited from an increase in average invested assets, resulting from continued growth in net written premiums and slightly higher yields, compared to a year ago. We expect after-tax fixed income NII in the fourth quarter to be about flat, when compared to the fourth quarter 2018 as a benefit from higher levels of invested assets will be largely offset by lower reinvestment rates. As we look ahead to 2020, we currently expect quarterly after-tax fixed income NII to be about $10 million to $15 million lower than our results for each of the first three quarters of 2019, as the impact of lower interest rates is expected to more than offset the benefit from higher levels of invested assets. Net un-favorable prior year reserve development was $294 million pretax, compared to $14 million of net favorable PYD in the prior year quarter. Bond and specialty insurance had net favorable PYD of $3 million. In personal insurance, favorable PYD of $19 million resulted from improvements in both domestic property and auto. Business insurance experienced net un-favorable PYD of $316 million pretax, including the $220 million increase to asbestos reserves, $134 million strengthening to general liability reserves and $114 million strengthening to commercial auto reserves, driven by similar factors to those we experienced in the second quarter. You may also notice that, we have a small charge for environmental this quarter. As a number of claims and related reserves have decreased over time, we've now moved to a quarterly evaluation rather than the annual evaluation we have historically completed during the second quarter. These reserve developments were partially offset by favorability in the worker's compensation and property lines. The asbestos reserves strengthening resulted from the completion of our annual asbestos review during the third quarter. As has been the case in recent years while there was some slight improvement in several of our asbestos indicators, including a decrease in deaths from mesothelioma as a percentage of the population over time, our expectation had been for more of an improvement. This phenomenon has continued to drive periodic reserve strengthening for us and for others in the industry.  As we've discussed before, we added a new catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019 providing coverage for PCS designated events for which we incur $5 million or more in losses above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. Through September 30th, we've accumulated $1.2 billion towards the $1.3 billion retention should we reach $1.3 billion, 86% of the next $500 million of qualifying losses will be covered by the treaty. Remember that the purposes of the treaty, hurricane and earthquake events have a cap of $250 million per occurrence.  Let me take a minute to address the topic of our subrogation claims against PG&E for the California wildfires of 2017 and 2018. On September 22nd, PG&E and the ad hoc subrogation group of which Travelers as a member agreed to a proposed $11 billion settlement for subrogation claims against PG&E. Because of the uncertainties that remain regarding our ultimate realization of subrogation benefits from PG&E, we have not reflected any benefits in our financials as of September 30th. As PG&E ultimately emerges from bankruptcy pursuant to a plan of reorganization which includes the proposed settlement, we estimate the Travelers would recover between $400 million and $450 million pre tax which is net of expenses and net of amounts that would inure to the benefit of our reinsurance.  Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $2 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. Recent decreases in interest rates have increased our net realized unrealized investment gains. As of September 30th, we had a net unrealized investment gain of $2.4 billion after tax.  Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses is now $90.9 3% higher than at the beginning of the year. Consistent with our historical capital management strategy, our first objective for the capital we generate from earnings is to invest it back into the business where we think we can do so at attractive returns. Beyond that will continue to return excess capital for shareholders. Accordingly, this quarter, we returned nearly $600 million to our shareholders comprising share repurchases of $375 million and dividends of $215 million. On a year-to-date basis, we have returned $1.8 billion of capital through dividends and share repurchases.  As we grow premium volumes with all else being equal, we will need to retain more capital. So to the extent we continue to grow, we would expect that over time, the amount of capital return to shareholders relative to earnings will be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been.  And with that, I'll turn the microphone over to Greg. \nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks Dan. Insurance produced segment income of $179 million and the combined ratio of 107% both impacted by net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $316 million pre tax as Dan mentioned. The underlying combined ratio of 95.9% was a half a point higher than the prior year quarter. There are several moving pieces underneath that variant, so we've included information on slide 9 of the earnings presentation to break down the components of the change. I'll start with the notable items that increased the underlying combined ratio year-over-year. The first three year items that we discussed with you previously with the first of those being the half point impact from the lower earned premium due to the net new cat treaty. The remaining two items related actions we took last quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year related to the challenging trends in the tort environment. The last of the un-favorable items related to adjustments to our loss estimates resulting from an even further deterioration in the tort environment as Alan and Dan have discussed. The impact of these latest adjustments was about a point, with about a third of that relating to the current quarter and the remaining two-thirds of that being the re-estimation of the first and second quarters of the year. Similar to last quarter, this quarter's adjustment included both commercial auto and general liability. I'll note that unlike Commercial Auto, where returns are clearly inadequate, the returns in the general liability line or primary-end access are much healthier for us.  Turning to the favorable year-over-year items, first one is point of favorability relating to adjusting our workers' compensation losses, about half of that impact relates to re-estimating the first two quarters of 2019. Second, our expense ratio benefited by about half a point due to the continued successful execution of our strategy to improve productivity and efficiency. Importantly, we continue to achieve this expense leverage, while investing in strategic initiatives that position us for the future. In addition to these individual favorable items, there was about half a point of favorable impact from other items that cause normal variability from period-to-period. Before turning to the top-line, I'll make a comment on weather-related losses. While non-cat weather losses in the quarter were elevated relative to our expectation, was not highlighted in the quarter-over-quarter underlying combined ratio comparison, as they were similarly elevated in the prior year quarter. Catastrophes for the quarter were below the long-term average in business insurance and so all-in weather losses for the segment were favorable to what we would consider a normal level. As for the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 7% over the prior year driven by strong underlying production results with renewal premium change being the biggest driver. In terms of domestic production, we continued to execute on our strategy to improve the margins in the book while retaining our high-quality portfolio. We achieved strong renewal premium change of 7.4% in the quarter, including renewal rate change of 4.3%. The renewal rate change was up seven-tenth of a point from the second quarter and more than two and half points from the third quarter of last year, demonstrating continued momentum in our execution even after the continued downward pressure in workers' comp pricing. The higher rate levels are being achieved broadly across the book with about three quarters of our middle-market accounts getting positive rate increases this quarter, which is up from about two-thirds in the third quarter of last year. Also, while the commercial auto and property lines continued to lead the way, our general liability both primary and excess as well as commercial multiplayer line also saw meaningful increases. Importantly, at the same time as we achieved these price increases, we maintained strong retention. New business of $568 million was up 21% from the prior year quarter, driven by strong result in our national property business which I'll touch on in a moment, as well as higher new business pricing and deliberate execution across the other markets. As for the individual businesses in select renewal premium change and renewal rate change both picked up from the second quarter year-over-year, while retention remains strong at 82%. New business was up 5% over the prior year quarter, reflecting strategic investments in product development and ease of doing business. To that end, we're excited to launch the completely redesigned small business owners' policy product in three states during the quarter that includes industry leading segmentation in a fast easy quoting experience. The full rollout of this product will take some time but we're encouraged with early returns.  In middle market renewal premium change was 6.3% with renewal rate change of 3.8% up more than two points from the third quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 86%. New business premiums of $308 million were up 15% from the prior year quarter driven by higher new business pricing, as well as success in writing larger accounts during the quarter, while impacts from large accounts will be lumpy from time to time we're pleased to see the results of this quarter as further evidence that the business center strategy that we've discussed with you is paying off by freeing up our local underwriters to spend more time on larger accounts.  Finally, I'll touch on our national property business, which has had two consecutive quarters with substantial year-over-year increases in new business. As I mentioned last quarter, in this space, we are seeing more opportunities given the level of disruption in the marketplace and we're selectively writing attractive accounts at our prices and on our terms and conditions. Case in point for the new accounts of size that we wrote in the second and third quarters, we've previously written and quoted 80% of them and let them go when we couldn't write them at prices and on terms and conditions that met our disciplined standards.  To close while we're managing through a changing environment and we couldn't be more pleased with our insight and execution. As Alan said, given the low interest rate environment, continued uncertainty around weather related losses and an upward pressure from the tort environment will continue to see great and use all other available levers to meet our return objectives.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom. \nTom Kunkel : Thanks, Greg. Bond and specialty delivered another quarter of strong returns and growth. Segment income was $139 million, a decrease of $57 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserved development and to a lesser extent, modestly higher management liability loss estimates for the current year. The underlying combined ratio increased 5.3 points from the prior year quarter.  As you can see on Slide 14, about 3 points of that is a third quarter adjustment for management liability coverages, about two points of which reflects a re-estimation of losses from the first two quarters of 2019. Despite the increase the combined and underlying combined ratios remain strong at 83.3% and 83.6%, respectively.  Net written premiums for the quarter were up 13% with strong growth across all businesses. In domestic management liability, we are pleased that retention remained at a historically high 90% with a renewal premium change higher at 4.8%. New business for the quarter was a record $67 million. Domestic surety growth reflected higher bond bonded contract sizes and our international growth was primarily in our UK management liability businesses, including from new product offerings. Our production results reflect the profitability of our high-quality portfolio, strong field execution and our strategic long-term investments in our suite of products and services, together with our commitment to thoughtful and disciplined underwriting and risk selection. As reflected in our improving renewal premium change, we are pursuing price increases for coverages, where we are experiencing elevated levels of loss activity and we will continue to do so. So bond and specialty remained strong, results remained strong and we feel terrific about our ability to continue to deliver excellent results over time. And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. In personal insurance this quarter, we're pleased with our continued execution in the marketplace as we grew premium and policies in force in both our agency automobile and homeowners and other product lines, continued to achieve excellent profitability in agency automobile and reported good results in agency homeowners and other, particularly considering a high level of noncatastrophe weather-related losses. The combined ratio for the quarter was 98%, slightly higher than the prior year quarter of 97.2%. For the segment catastrophes and net favorable prior year reserve development were comparable to the prior year quarter, while the underlying combined ratio was higher by 1.1 points, primarily driven by higher noncatastrophe weather-related losses and the impact from the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty partially offset by lower other loss activity. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 7% with strong retention, renewal premium change and new business.  Agency automobile delivered another strong quarterly performance with the combined ratio of 93%. This is our seventh consecutive quarterly combined ratio under 96%. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter of 92.7% was comparable to the prior year quarter and consistent with an excellent year-to-date result of 92.8%, two points lower than the prior year. In agency homeowners and other, the third quarter combined ratio of 100.2%, increased 1.7 points from the prior quarter, driven primarily by a higher underlying combined ratio, partially offset by lower catastrophe losses and a favorable change in prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter of 93.5% was five points higher than the prior year quarter, as approximately four points of higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses and 1.5 point impact from the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty were partially offset by lower other loss activity. The higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses this quarter are on top of an elevated level in the prior year quarter and are reflective of an increased number of events compared to historical experience. As a point of reference, data from NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, reflects approximately 8,500 severe weather events in the U.S. for the third quarter of 2019, that's a 28% increase when compared to the average third quarter for the period 2013 to 2018. As we've mentioned in the past, we've increased our loss expectations to reflect higher levels of loss activity and property and that's reflected in the pricing gains we're achieving and our plans to further improve pricing and property going forward. Before I shift to discussing production, I'll remind you that, looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there tends to be a good amount of seasonality in our combined ratio results. On a relative basis, fourth quarter losses are typically higher than the full year average for automobile and lower for homeowners and other.  Shifting to quarterly production agency automobile premiums were 3% with modest growth and new business and policies enforce, while retention remains strong at 84% and renewal premium change was 3.6. We remain focused on actions to grow our auto business at returns that are continued to meet our objectives, and are encouraged by the increase in policies enforced this quarter. Agency homeowners and others delivered another strong production quarter with retention of 86% even as renewal premium change rose to 6.9% up more than three points from the prior quarter. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter where renewal premium change is higher than the corresponding prior year quarter.  Consistent with our objectives, new business for agency homeowners and other was up over the prior quarter with increases in both issue policies and average new business premiums, largely driven by our ongoing successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. We remain pleased with the quality of the new business we're writing. The profile of the business is consistent with our expectations and most of the increase in issued policies results from higher quote volume at a consistent quote rate. As we intended sales and marketing activities associated with the rollout of Quantum Home 2.0 along with this granular pricing segmentation, customizable coverages and ease of quoting are leading contributors to higher new business volumes.  Wrapping up while profitability for the quarter was down slightly from the third quarter of 2018 we're pleased with our year-to-date results. Segment income of $497 million and the combined ratio of 96.2% are both significantly improved relative to the prior year. Given our pricing actions and property and early signs of policy growth in auto, we remain confident in our ability to generate profitable growth going forward. The competitive advantage of a balanced and diversified portfolio and our focus on being a complete property and casualty solution for our agents and customers continues to position us well in the marketplace.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe. \nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much and now we're ready to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJay Gelb : I want to touch base on the liability claims inflation issue across GL, commercial auto and DNO, I realize that this topic was discussed and especially warned about it at the Barclays conference last month and what I'm trying to get a perspective on is whether the company can say we have the all clear on reserve issues going forward are the sole risk of more and more reserve strengthened going forward given there has been an issue in three of the past four quarters?\nAlan Schnitzer: I don't think that we or any company could ever give that kind of assurance, we take our best people our best processes, we look at the data that we have, and we come up with our best estimate every quarter. When we look back over the last four quarters of decisions that we've made, and the estimates that that we published, we look at it and say gee based on the information we had at the time, we think we made the right call, we weren't too aggressive in any of our assumptions, we in fact picked close to the top end of the range and in many of those cases and again this quarter we looked at the data and we think we've done the right thing. So and that's one of the reasons why we wanted to provide Slide 21. You can see this is an industrywide phenomenon and you can see the extent of the shift at least from an industry perspective. This isn't in our data, but it's illustrative and relevant in thinking about our data, it's quite a significant shift. And in one of the associated factors is just lengthening of the claim development pattern and that's a difficult thing to assess as it emerges. And so, with every quarter, we get a new data point, with every new data point, we get a different trend line and we put our best estimate behind it and we continue to think running the business by the numbers, being very disciplined about that is the right way to do it. So, the answer is, we have got a long track record of managing that way over time. We think we're running it the right way and we think we have got the right estimate now, but I don't think we or anybody could give you a guarantee.\nJay Gelb : Right. Although. That's what you're saying, you are as confident as you can be that this issue is addressed, right.\nAlan Schnitzer : I'm just confident as I can be that is our best estimate.\nJay Gelb : Right. Okay. And then, separate topic with regard to capital return I believe there was commentary in the prepared remarks around potentially less capital being returned as a percentage of earnings as the company's growth rate continues to accelerate. Would you be able to give us some parameters around that? I mean, historically, it's been right around 100% of earnings and return annually in the form dividends and share buybacks. Would that number be something closer to 75% or should we think about another number?\nDan Frey: Jay, I don't think, it's Dan. I don't think, we would target a number and I don't think you should think about it as a target per say. That's going to be an outcome of the things that we always talk about, which is, how much capital do we have? How much capital do we think we need to adequately support the business that we're writing and that we expect to add on a go forward basis? What are all the investments we make in the business that we think can generate an adequate return and then we look at what's left and return it. The comment was intended to raise awareness, as you say, from this point forward, as we continue to grow premium to support a business that's got a bigger premium base you're going to need a bigger capital base. And if you perpetually return to 100% of earnings your capital base wouldn't change. So, it's simply to give an indication that, as we continue to grow, if all of those remained equal, you should expect something lower than it otherwise wouldn't have been. But, we're actually not going to target a particular percentage of earnings that we're looking to return.\nAlan Schnitzer : And Jay, I'll just add two things to that. One is, no change at all in our thought process or growth toward capital management. This is in ordinary course just a function of what we have been able achieve in terms of growing premium base. And two, one of the reasons why we can't give you a number is it's going to depend on what lines we're growing in and what the geography is and it's just not linear math behind it. So, we couldn't actually give you that target.\nJay Gelb : I appreciate that. Thanks very much.\nAlan Schnitzer : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. \nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Good morning. My first question you know goes to your outlook for business insurance. Broadly, really unchanged and you guys are looking for margin improvement which given the commentary in the queue seems to be a function of price exceeding trend and some improvement in your international business. So, what I'm trying to get a sense of is, you know, what is the forward view on you guys have for price and then also for trend, can you give us a sense and I know it's a compilation of all your different businesses where trends sits today and then the outlook for that as we think about improvement coming into your margin from here in the Business Insurance segment? \nGreg Toczydlowski : Elyse, in terms of the outlook for price, you see the price that we've written and that's going to earn in. And we give you an outlook for RPC. And so, it's those two components that are going to earn in over time. In terms of loss trend, we always talk about that in BI from a segment perspective and we shared last quarter that we had increased our view of loss trend to 4.5%, and that's obviously on top of the current PIKs which have been adjusted throughout the course of the year. So, it really is the math from those pieces. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. So, trend was 4.5% last quarter. So, it's somewhere within the vicinity of 5% right now? \nGreg Toczydlowski: No, no. The 4.5% was up a half a point from what we had historically talked about at 4%. Also, Elyse, I'll caution you that the 4.5% is our long-term outlook on loss trend. And so, in any given period, there's going to be some volatility in actual losses. But that's sort of the math and the way we think about it over time. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then, my second question, within Business Insurance, you guys released reserves within workers' comp. You also lowered your loss PIKs there this quarter. I guess I'm just trying to get a little bit more color. Given the weaker pricing in comp combined with the higher loss trend you're now seeing in other businesses within that segment, what gave you guys, like, the conviction to change your PIKs there? And then, if you could also let us know the prior-year development on comp in the quarter. Thank you. \nDan Frey: Elyse, it's Dan. So, I'll start. Thematically, what gives us the conviction to move on workers' comp is, as we see results come in, again, there's a long-term assumption around what's going to happen to the cost to settle workers' comp claims. A lot of that's driven by medical cost inflation. And we see in our data and there has been discussion in the industry that medical cost inflation has continued to be pretty benign relative to our expectation. So, that drives the prior-year release as another period of data comes by where, again, the cost of loss settlement comes in favorable to what our expectation was. In this quarter, in round numbers, order of magnitude is around $100 million pre-tax, a little less than that. That flows through into what we're seeing in the current period as well. Obviously, in the current period, you're reacting to both what are you seeing in terms of the number of claims coming in and those settlement trends. So, workers' comp has been a pretty steady level of good news relative to our expectations and that's why we adjusted both numbers. \nAlan Schnitzer: Elyse, I'd just add. It's just ordinary course. We treated workers' comp this period like we treated it every other period. And we didn't actually make a change to either our frequency trend or severity trend. It's the impact of adjustments to prior-year reserve that's rolling through the current year. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you very much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. \nMike Zaremski : Hey, good morning. First question is on the catastrophe reinsurance treaty because I have a feeling it's going to trip us up in our models. So, I believe you said it's up to $1.2 billion. So, it's very close to the $1.3 billion retention. And you've reported $800 million of catastrophes, which is a separate definition. So, if we trip the $1.3 billion, which it seems likely from a profitability standpoint, does that start benefiting the underlying loss ratio in both the commercial and homeowner segments? Or just if you can help us think about that. \nDan Frey: Mike, it's Dan again. I think as we discussed the treaty from when we first talked about it going back to the first quarter, it will depend on what weather actually comes in over the remainder of the year. If we have a treaty benefit, how the treaty benefit will be allocated back between what we would call major cats versus minor cats. So, if all the losses that come in from this point forward are major cat and that's what causes us to trip the treaty, and then those are the recoveries, most of the benefit would be attributable to major cats. If on the other hand, most of the weather that comes in is $10 million to $15 million PCS events that don't meet our major cat threshold, that's where the money will go. So, it really is too early to tell and it will depend on what actual weather we experience in the fourth quarter. \nMike Zaremski: So, it could benefit the underlying loss ratio as well. \nDan Frey: That's correct. \nMike Zaremski: And lastly, so if I think about the past two to three years and what sticks out, top line growth, clearly, has improved for the company, but it's also coincided during a period of time of increasing non-cat weather losses. You guys have said catastrophe levels are -- you had changed your view on that being a little higher and you now are seeing kind of higher liability loss trends in the last year or so. So, is this all telling us that top line growth and maybe retention rates need to maybe fall a little in the coming year and take a step off the gas a little bit? \nAlan Schnitzer: No. Mike, I don't think that's the way we think about it at all. We don't ring a bell and say grow or ring a bell and say don't grow. We execute one account, one class of business at a time, and we do that with a return focus. And so, we're out there executing on our accounts, trying to retain the ones we want, on the prices and terms and conditions that we want. And we're out there hustling our new business that we find attractive and that meets our return objectives. And when the sum of those things adds up to growth, we'll grow. And when it doesn't, we won't. So, there's nothing about the growth that's contributed to the loss environment and we are pretty good about reflecting the loss environment into our pricing models. And so, the answer is, I don't think so. The other thing I would say is the growth that we've seen is -- and I don't want to diminish the strategic efforts that's led to new business. I think that's important and it's been successful. But a very big component of the growth that we've reported has come from a very strong foundation of retention and price on top of that. So, that's important to keep in mind as well. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. \nLarry Greenberg: Good morning and thank you. So, on commercial auto, I'm just trying to compare what you're experiencing with the issues that you had a while back in personal auto. And I think then, you talked about taking a higher loss PIK or adjusting your loss PIK for severity. But then, the actual trend really hadn't changed in your view. So, if I'm hearing correctly, in this situation, we're talking about higher kind of loss PIK foundations and then an accelerating trend on top of that, is that fair? \nAlan Schnitzer: We've definitely increased the base year. And we also, last quarter, as we told you, increased the loss trend from there. So, we have increased both in commercial auto. Is that responsive, Larry? I'm trying to make sure... \nLarry Greenberg: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's great. And then -- and I think Greg talked about pricing and terms and conditions. Can you talk about how terms and conditions might be changing in response to what's going on? \nGregToczydlowski : Sure, Larry. Good morning. This is Greg. Yes, most of the terms and conditions activity are happening in the national property space, and that certainly is leaking down into property across middle market. And I think our underwriters start with the first thing, is they look at the total insured value, making sure that we've got the right values on the properties. From there, we'll get into discussions with both distribution and the customer around co-insurance, and that includes both deductibles and sublimits. You can think of sublimits on both flood and earthquake, but those are some of the items that are in the marketplace right now and our underwriters are very involved in pulling those levers. \nLarry Greenberg: Yeah. I was thinking more in terms of commercial auto. \nAlan Schnitzer: Larry, in response to that, given the environmental nature of that, most of the PIK for that is going to come from price. To some lesser degree, it will come from some risk selection, and that's a factor as well. And then, we'll calibrate our litigation strategy and those would be primarily the three levers we use to address it. \nLarry Greenberg: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. \nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call. I was hoping we could revisit sort of the view in commercial insurance between -- the relationship between pricing and retention. I guess I'm a little surprised at the strength of the retention given you are raising prices. And I'm just wondering if that means that you're not stepping on the pricing as hard as you could or if there's some other dynamic going on there. \nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. Paul, again, we're executing one account at a time. And so, we're making the right decisions on price and retention, we think. I think one takeaway that we take from the retention is that there is certainly more room to go. The market is not pushing back on us, which I think is evidence that these really are environmental issues. So, we think the execution is terrific and we think there's more room to go. I think, also, in terms of our customers and our distribution relationships, doing this thoughtfully, slowly , steadily, I think there's a lot of benefit to that. And so, that's part of our execution strategy. \nGregToczydlowski: Paul, one thing I would add -- this is Greg -- is those are both headline numbers, both the rate and the retention. Our underwriters are equipped with very granular segmentation, and so we spend more time watching the mix distribution of some of the distressed accounts and the healthy accounts than we do in the aggregate numbers. We're pleased with that execution when we look at that segmentation. \nPaul Newsome : And, separately, I was wondering, as we look at the expense ratio, if there is any impact this quarter from change in contingent commissions that would affect, either this quarter or maybe even next year, the level of the expense ratio. \nDan Frey: Paul, it's Dan. I'd say, across the place, generally not. It's been pretty consistent. And contingent commission is a relatively small component of the overall commission mix to begin with. \nPaul Newsome: Great, thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. \nDavid Motemaden: Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the changes that were made in general liability. Are you still -- are the changes really still commercial auto related excess or has it spread to other parts of GL? And if you could talk a bit about the changes you made to each portion of that. \nAlan Schnitzer: David, it continues to be both. Again, I think the right way to look at this is, broadly, over the last year, as we've been addressing this issue, and if you look at it in that context, commercial auto and the excess GL where the underlying event is auto related continues to be the majority of it. But GL has been a not insignificant factor. And, in fact, in this quarter was a bigger factor than commercial auto.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it, okay. And just in terms of just putting numbers around it, a peer had come out and said they were seeing severity on the GL side up in the high-single digits. Just wondering, is that sort of what you guys are seeing and is that what you guys are assuming now going forward in your loss PIKs? \nAlan Schnitzer: We've just never given the severity at that granular level, and I don't think we're inclined to do that. We stop at the segment level where we've given you the 4.5%. And I also think there can be some confusion when we're talking quickly about loss trend because, ultimately, we're trying to get to a loss PIK and there's two things that contribute to that. One is base year changes and two is a change in loss trend. And as I said earlier, over the course of this year, as it relates to liability lines, we've raised both the initial loss PIK, which we refer to as base year and the loss trend. So, those are both up.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it, okay. And just a follow-up. The slide in the back, that would imply that what you guys are seeing is more severity related, but are you also seeing just a spike in frequency from higher attorney involvement as well? \nAlan Schnitzer: No, it's definitely more of a severity issue than a frequency issue. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nJosh Shanker: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my call. So, I wonder if there's any way of getting to a little more granularity on the tort issues. As you've acknowledged you're experiencing and you do look at your competitors numbers and they're not. Is there something going on in the account size that's different between large, middle market and small account on the tort severity side that might make Travelers book look different than some others? \nAlan Schnitzer: Josh, I don't -- my instinct is no, and that's one of the reasons we shared the industry data, is we don't that -- we believe this is environmental. We don't think there's anything about our book of business that makes us more susceptible to these types of claims. And you turn on the TV, you see attorney advertising. The rate of attorney involvement and the aggressive behavior is up and I think that's going to impact anybody writing liability coverages. So, we don't think there's any reason to think that our book of business is more susceptible than anybody else. \nJosh Shanker: And then, do you have anything you can add to the granularity where you're seeing the biggest tort severity issues from your own experience? \nAlan Schnitzer: Josh, it's broadly across geographies, business and accounts. I guess, if you're -- again, it's always hard to generalize broadly in a sentence or two because this is a complex issue. We've spent hundreds of hours on this internally. So, it's always difficult to try to summarize in a sentence or two. Broadly speaking, it's probably groups have homogeneous type claims where a potential plaintiff can be reached by television commercial. And so, whether that's commercial auto accidents or slips and falls or things like that, once you get into the bigger stuff, you tend to have cases that are and always have been associated with claimants being represented and aggressive litigation, but, again, that's -- it's a very high level summary of a complex issue. \nJosh Shanker: And then, Elyse kind of asked it, but I just wanted to -- the workers' comp reserve release for the intra-year reserve, is third quarter typically a quarter where you do a comprehensive workers' comp reserve analysis? Should we expect typically that, in the third quarter, we could see resets of PIKs typically? \nDan Frey: Josh, it's Dan. Not really. The comp is something that we have enough data and enough information that's in the regular flow that we're assessing work comp reserve levels every quarter, and I've commented on work comp in PYD in earlier quarters this year. \nJosh Shanker: Okay. Thank you for the answers. \nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. \nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Just a couple of quick ones here. First one, if I kind of strip out some of the noise in the quarter on Business Insurance, it looks like the underlying loss ratio kind of improved, call it, by 40 to 50 basis points. Is that a kind of fair representation of what an earned rate right now is coming through in excess of trend? \nAlan Schnitzer: That's a business insurance question? \nBrian Meredith: Yeah, Business Insurance. Sorry, yeah. Just making all of the adjustments that you put in the slide, it looks like it's about 40 to 50 basis points of improvement on a year-over-year basis. \nAlan Schnitzer: Brian, we're looking at the math. Yeah, I don't think it's quite so easy to look at it that way. You're getting to a very narrow view of rate versus loss trend. And I understand why that's so appealing to look at. But the fact is, there's a lot of things that go into margin. And whether it's mix or reinsurance or claims handling or risks, there's all sorts of things that go into that. And so, really hard to look at rate versus loss trend and think you've captured it. \nBrian Meredith: Got you. And then, just one other quick one here. As I look at your outlook for RPC for the Business Insurance here over the next 12 months, what is your assumption with respect to exposure in that figure? Do you expect it to kind of moderate here, be the same? \nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. We just don't break that out. There's a lot of estimation that goes into that number. And we have a view on the pieces, but to imply that we've got that level of granularity out a year, that would be a false impression. \nBrian Meredith: Great, thanks. \nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley, your line is open. \nMichael Phillips: Thank you. And thanks for the time here. I guess I'll take the pressure off on Business Insurance, guys. Switch over to personal, and specifically personal auto. Your outlook says for margins that are relatively in line with last year. So, I guess, could you talk about what you're seeing there in pricing and loss trends? We're certainly hearing loss trend is on the rise in some segments from competitors. So, kind of want to see what you're thinking there and why we'd expect it to be flat next year? \nMichael Klein: Sure, Michael. This is Michael Klein. I would say, we see the same industry data you referring to and certainly are keeping an eye on severity trends both in physical damage and in bodily injury. As we've talked about this year, we've tended to see frequency going the other way and offsetting some of those severity increases. Our view of loss trend heading into the outlook is fairly consistent with the trends we've been seeing. The outlook includes an assumption that pricing will continue to moderate in auto, and that's consistent with our strategy to continue to work to return to growing policies in force. So, the broadly consistent outlook has a little bit less earned price in it than we've been running and, again, a consistent view of loss trend. And then, lastly, I would just remind you that for sort of rolling four quarters we do expect a higher combined ratio in the fourth quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2018, partly driven by normal seasonality and driven by the fact that we had an unusually good quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as some prior-quarter good guide catch-up in that quarter. So, it's a tough comparison, fourth quarter to fourth quarter. \nMichael Phillips: Okay, great. No, thank you for that detail. And then, I guess, second question on Bond & Specialty. What are you seeing in the management liability and kind of maybe some more granular details of kind of what's driving that increase there. \nTom Kunkel: Sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. So, if you look back at where we started reserving at the beginning of 2019, there were definitely some elements of normal loss trend versus rate that impacted how we were reserving there. But when you look at that third quarter re-estimation we did, that was largely driven by an increase in frequency, having to do with things like #MeToo, sexual harassment and, to a lesser degree, securities class action suits. So, that's really what we've seen driving any movement that we've had in management liability there. By the way, I should point out that where we're having elevated loss trending, we're definitely pursuing price in the marketplace. I think you can see that with publicly traded companies and you can see it in various other parts of the marketplace that are impacted by the scenarios I discussed. \nMichael Phillips: Okay, great. Thank you very much for the color there. \nTom Kunkel: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. \nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Just had a couple of quick technical ones and then a broader one for Alan. But, first of all, just trying to size this, within multi-peril, what percentage of the claims dollars are usually for liability type of stuff versus property? \nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, I don't know that we have that at our fingertips or that we've vetted that number, Ryan. \nRyan Tunis: Got you. And then -- that's fine. The other one I had was just -- it seems like part of this is auto claims and excess umbrella, those type of things. Is there a -- can we get a sense for maybe like what percentage of overall casualty claims outside of workers' comp or something like that can be tied back to something auto related? Is there some way that you think about that? Just trying to think about the auto exposure outside of what you explicitly call commercial auto. \nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. We definitely don't have that breakout at our fingertips here, Ryan. We can look for that and try to figure out whether we can share that outside of this call, but we definitely don't have that in a vetted way that I think we'd be comfortable sharing. \nRyan Tunis: Okay. No, that's fair enough. And then, again, Alan, I guess this is sort of a broad one. But, yeah, this is, I guess, the third quarter of the last four where we've had, I guess, an increase in the loss PIKs. What would you point us to this quarter that would give us more confidence that that's unlikely to happen going forward? Like, what are you looking at that gives you more confidence, that should give us more confidence? \nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. Ryan, I think it was the first question of the call. I wish I could stand up and guarantee that we've got it and this will never happen again. Obviously, I can't do that. I don't think anyone can do it. And I'd point to the magnitude of the shift, which is very recent information, and the long tail line. The lengthening of the claim development pattern really does complicate our ability to assess it. So, it's a complicated process. And it's taken us a couple of quarters to get to where we are. We're going to get another quarter's worth of data in a couple of months here and we'll see where that comes in. There is an incremental level of confidence that comes from the fact that we've now got a couple of quarters strung together and a view on what a new trend line might be. So, that gives us a little bit more comfort. But I can't tell you now where the next dot was going to come in on the chart or what that's going to do to the trend line. It's data we haven't seen yet. I can tell you that we now have four quarters of data and a new trend line. We've certainly reacted to that and we're confident that we're taking the right swing at it. But I don't know what I could tell you beyond that. \nRyan Tunis: But you'd say that the '19 PIKs are now relatively reflective of some of the more seasoned accident years at this point? \nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. For sure it would be more reflective of the more seasoned accident years. You've got the '17 and '18 accident years, which I -- I think the '17 accident year is, on commercial auto, less than 50% paid. And so, the GL would be even less than that and the '18 accident year would be less than that on both. So, we've got a couple of recent and accident years that are still developing. But the older accident years, yes, as they season, we certainly feel much better about those. And as I said, we now have four quarters where we've -- it's not just another data point. It's another line. And we've reflected that in a way that we feel is very responsible in terms of coming up with our best estimate. But I can't and nobody could tell you what the next data point is going to look like. \nRyan Tunis: Okay, thanks. I'll leave it there. \nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you. \nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Sean Reitenbach with KBW. Your line is open. \nSean Reitenbach: Hello. For PG&E, would any benefit from there come through operating income? \nDan Frey: Yeah. Ryan, it's Dan. It would. It would come through the same way we would record any prior-year reserve development. So, it will be in core income. It won't affect the underlying combined ratio because it relates to prior accident years. \nSean Reitenbach: Okay. And although it's still very strong, the retention rate slipped by a point in 3Q. Would you expect any further kind of -- that to tick down any further as a result of either any kind of non-renewing any business that you've had trouble with or pushing for more rate and losing lose anything there? \nDan Frey: I would say the retention rates remains very, very strong by historical standards, particularly an environment where we're getting rate at the level that we're getting it. So, we feel terrific about the retention. We don't project where that's going. So, I don't have a comment on that. But I will say that we like our book of business and our objective would be to keep a lot of it. \nSean Reitenbach: Thank you very much. \nDan Frey: Thank you. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I now turn the call back to Ms. Abbe Goldstein. \nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much for joining us this morning. And as always, if there is any follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Thanks. And have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call, thank you for your participation.

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 23, 2019. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you so much and good morning. Welcome to Travelers discussion of our second quarter 2019 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three Segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of our webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. The overall results for the quarter were solid, benefiting from the continued successful execution of our strategic agenda. We said for years that the primary measure we use for managing the business is return on equity and we've also said that any strategy to deliver leading return on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time. To that end, a few years ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of change we've previously identified impacting our industry. We established key innovation priorities and invested in capabilities consistent with those priorities. The successful execution of that strategy has contributed to growth over the past several years and contributed to the growth in earnings this quarter. Earned premiums were up 4% to almost $7 billion, adding meaningfully to underwriting income in the quarter. We've also shared that improving productivity and efficiency is a priority and efforts we've been undertaking for some time to leverage technology investments and workflow enhancements are paying off. Again, this quarter and year-to-date, we've grown the top line and managed general and administrative expenses to about flat, while continuing to make important investments in the business. All of that, together with strong performance from our investment portfolio, contributed to core income of $537 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter and core income per diluted share of $2.02, a 12% increase over the prior year. Core return on equity was 9.2%. In terms of underwriting margins, this quarter we delivered a solid all-in combined ratio of 98.4%. As a reminder, our expected weather losses are seasonally highest in the second quarter. But as you can see on page 4 of the webcast, the underlying combined ratio was up 1.3 points over the prior year quarter. There were a number of favorable items impacting the underlying results, including a lower level of large losses and improved expense leverage. But I'd like to highlight and put in context two items contributing to the increase; non-catastrophe weather losses and some continued deterioration of trends in the tort environment. I'll start with the weather which, of the two, had the larger impact. For the quarter, total weather losses in the aggregate, cat and non-cat, were well within the range of what we would consider normal. But breaking that down, catastrophe losses were favorable, while non-cat weather losses were worse than what we would consider a normal level for the second quarter. That resulted in a nearly 2-point increase in the underlying combined ratio compared to the prior year quarter. Again, all-in weather losses weren't far off what we planned for, so we consider this bucketing. In terms of the tort environment, the trends we discussed in the fourth quarter of last year impacting bodily injury severity in Commercial Auto have developed a little worse than we expected in the Commercial Auto line. And while we anticipated those trends extending into the other liability coverages, they extended into the primary and excess coverages of the general liability line somewhat more than we anticipated. That drove the adjustment this quarter. On the whole and looking back over the last three quarters, the issues continued to be most heavily associated with Commercial Auto related losses, manifesting in two places, in the Commercial Auto line, as you would expect, and also in excess coverages of the general liability line, where the underlying losses are auto related. The run rate earnings impact of this updated view of the tort environment is a little less than $20 million per quarter after tax. The current quarter underlying result also included a catch up of about the same amount from development of the first quarter. The aggregate impact of the first and second quarter adjustments added around two-thirds-of-a-point of the consolidated underlying combined ratio, which amounts to about $0.14 per share. Also, I'll note that unlike Commercial Auto, where the returns are still clearly inadequate, the returns in the general liability line, both primary and excess are much healthier for us. Turning to the topline. Production was once again excellent in the quarter. We grew net written premiums by 4% to a record $7.5 billion. Our premium growth reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change broadly across the portfolio. As I pointed out before, that speaks to the high quality of the business we're putting on the books. We're growing our new and renewal business with confidence in terms of accounts, geographies and industries that we know well. In Business Insurance, we achieved renewal premium change of 6.7%, including renewal rate change of 3.6%. In both cases, the highest level since five years, while maintaining historically high levels of retention. We increased renewal rate change and renewal premium change both year-over-year and sequentially in each of our product lines other than workers' compensation. In our leading Bond & Specialty business, we once again achieved strong production in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses, with a record levels of retention and new business in domestic Management Liability. In Personal Insurance, higher net written premiums benefited from renewal premium increases in both our Agency Automobile and Agency Home businesses and an all-time high for domestic new business. We have momentum in all of our businesses. And in an environment of persistently low interest rates, ongoing uncertainty surrounding weather-related losses and continuing challenges in the tort environment, we will continue to leverage the power of franchise to meet our return objectives, including by continuing to selectively and thoughtfully seek pricing and improved terms and conditions. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results. To sum it up, our performance this quarter and year-to-date reflect both the successful execution of our long-term strategy and our relentless execution in the marketplace every day. With leading data and analytics in the hands of our frontline underwriters, the best talent in the industry and deep relationships with our agents and brokers, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver shareholder value over time. And with, that I'll turn it over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the second quarter was $537 million, up 9% from $494 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 9.2%, up from 8.7%. Earnings per share and core earnings per share were up 9% and 12% respectively. Our second quarter results include $367 million of pretax catastrophe losses, down from $488 million in last year's quarter, but the lower level of cat losses was more than offset by higher levels of non-cat weather. As we have previously disclosed, our definition of catastrophes is limited to industry events where our losses exceed a specified dollar amount generally around $20 million. In the second quarter, a larger portion of the weather losses we experienced fell below our cat threshold and thus adversely impacted our underlying combined ratio. But again, as you heard from Alan, overall weather results, cat and non-cat combined were well within the range of what we would expect. In terms of weather expectations, during our fourth quarter earnings call, we explained that our expectations for cat losses for 2019 would trend up for two reasons. One is that we've seen growth in our premium volume and the overall exposure level in the business. Two, is that we're replacing a little more weight on recent periods and that results in a bit of an uptick in terms of our view of normal cat load per dollar premium. Adding the seasonality of our cat losses in our second quarter total weather results were no surprise. Pretax underlying underwriting gain, which excludes the impacts of cats in prior year reserve development decreased by 19%. Higher non-cat weather-related losses adversely impacted the underlying combined ratio of 94.9% by nearly two points compared to the prior year quarter. Also, and to a lesser degree, the change in the underlying combined ratio was impacted by several favorable items, including lower large losses and improved expense leverage, partially offset by a modest impact from the continuing challenges in the tort environment as Alan mentioned. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter was $123 million pretax, down from $186 million in the prior quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD was $71 million. In terms of highlights, the net favorability resulted primarily from better-than-expected performance in workers' comp, which improved by about $275 million. Partially offsetting the favorability in workers' comp is unfavorable development of approximately $125 million in general liability for both primary and excess coverages and Commercial Auto. This represents the estimated impact of the continuing challenges in the tort environment that drove the nearly $20 million of after-tax run rate increase in the current quarter's underlying losses. Second quarter PYD in Business Insurance also included a $60 million increase to environmental reserves for accident years prior to 2010. As a follow-up to last quarter, second quarter PYD also included a modest impact, resulting from a handful of additional states, extending the statute of limitations for molestation claims. The impact on our book from these legislative changes in the second quarter was much smaller than the first quarter impact from the adoption of similar legislation in New York. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable PYD of $39 million was driven by domestic Management Liability. In Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $13 million was driven by favorability in our domestic businesses. Last week, the U.K. updated the Ogden rate, which is the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts. The rate change was modest, and as a result we expect to book only a small benefit in the third quarter. Net investment income increased by 8% from the prior year quarter to $548 million after tax as higher fixed income returns were complemented by higher returns in our non-fixed income portfolio. Fixed income NII increased by $25 million after tax, due to the higher-average yield on invested assets and an increase in the amount of average invested assets. Higher returns in the private equity portfolio reflected the broader market recovery. Looking forward with interest rate expectations now lower than they were three months ago, we have updated our outlook and now expect after-tax fixed income NII for the remainder of 2019, to increase by approximately $10 million to $15 million per quarter compared to the same period a year ago. As we discussed on our earnings calls for the last two quarters, we added a new catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019 providing coverage for PCS-designated events for which we incur $5 million or more in losses, above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. While the impact on written premiums was reflected entirely in the first quarter, the new treaty impacts all four quarters on an earned basis. For the second quarter, the impact of the treaty increased our consolidated underlying combined ratio by about 0.5 point as expected. Through June 30, we've accumulated a little less than $800 million towards the $1.3 billion retention. As you think about the elevated non-cat weather this quarter, it's important to keep in mind that much of that weather activity was from non-PCS events that did not count towards the treaty. On the topic of reinsurance, I'll direct your attention to page 20 of the webcast and provide an update on our catastrophe reinsurance program. The structure of our cat reinsurance treaty is generally consistent with the prior year. We renewed our Northeast Cat Treaty effective July 1st with substantially similar terms and flat pricing. Our cat bond Long Point Re III is in the second year of its four-year term. And in the annual reset for the 2019 hurricane season, the attachment point was adjusted from $1.9 billion to $1.79 billion, while the total cost of the program was flat year-over-year. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, which also includes a description of our gen cat, aggregate EXOL treaties that covers in the accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our 10-Q, which we filed earlier today and in our 2018 10-K. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.2 billion were again very strong all our capital ratios were at or better-than-target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. Net unrealized investment gains increased from $1 billion after tax as of March 31 to $1.9 billion after tax as of June 30 due to the decrease in interest rates during the quarter. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $90.05 at June 30, 3% higher than at year-end and 6% higher than the end of the second quarter last year. We returned nearly $600 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $376 million and dividends of $217 million. On a year-to-date basis we have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the mic over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced segment income of $351 million for the quarter and a combined ratio of 101.1%. The combined ratio includes catastrophe losses, which were essentially in line with our expectations for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 97.4% was 0.9 points higher than the prior year quarter. There are several moving pieces underneath the 0.9 point year-over-year change, so we've added page 9 to the webcast to illustrate the components. I'll start with the notable items that increased the underlying combined ratio year-over-year. The most significant item was non-cat weather, which was higher than the prior year quarter by about a point. Next, are two items that we've discussed with you previously, the first is the 0.5 point impact from lower earned premium due to the new cat treaty, and the second is the approximately 0.5 point run rate impact related to the Q4 2018 re-estimation of Commercial Auto losses. The last of the unfavorable adjustments relates to further deterioration of the trends related to the continuing challenges in the tort environment that drove the re-estimation of Commercial Auto losses in the fourth quarter as you heard from Alan. The most recent data showed loss experience that was somewhat higher than our revised expectations from the fourth quarter. This included further modest deterioration in auto and extended into general liability for both primary and excess coverage's to a higher degree than we had previously anticipated. For these adjustments, there is about 0.5 point of ongoing run rate impact and about 0.5 point of catch-up from the first quarter of 2019. As for the favorable year-over-year items, first, we had about 1.5 point from domestic large losses returning to a more normal level as we expected. And second, we had about 0.5 point driven by continued benefit from higher earned premium volumes and disciplined expense management. Importantly, we continue to achieve this expense leverage, while investing in strategic initiatives that position us for the future. Now to the top line. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 2% over the prior year driven by strong underlying production results. Partially offsetting the production results were some items that were generally timing in nature. For example, we changed the timing of one of our reinsurance treaties from the first quarter to the second quarter. Adjusting for those items, the top line trends were in line with recent quarters. In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 6.7% in the quarter, including renewal rate change of 3.6% both their highest level in five years. The renewal rate change was up 1.3 points from the first quarter and more than 1.5 points from the second quarter of last year. This is a strong result particularly given continued rate decreases in workers' comp. While the Commercial Auto and Property lines continue to lead the way, our general liability both primary and access as well as C&P lines also saw meaningful increases. Importantly, at the same time as we achieved these pricing increases remained historically high retention of 85%. Last quarter, we said that in addition to price, we've also been focused on improving terms and conditions particularly in our property coverages. In this quarter, terms and conditions, things like deductibles, sub-limits and insurance-to-value tightened further contributing to rate adequacy. Even after our updated view of loss trend resulting from our re-estimation of losses in the auto and general liability lines, which increased our overall view of domestic loss trend by about 0.5 point, we estimate that pricing that is rate plus the portion of exposure that acts like rate was an excess of loss trend on a written basis for the quarter. New business of $531 million in total was essentially flat to a strong prior year quarter. We're very pleased with our production results and our continued granular and deliberate execution. As you heard from Alan, given the low interest rate environment, continued uncertainty around weather-related losses and some upward pressure from the tort environment, we'll continue to seek rate and use all the other available levers to meet our return objectives. As for the individual businesses, in select renewal premium change, the renewal rate change both ticked up from the first quarter, while retention remained strong at 82%. New business was strong in comparable to the prior year quarter. We're pleased with the returns in this business and these production results reflect our strategic execution. In middle market, renewal premium change was 6.1% with renewal rate of 3.4%, up more than a point from the first quarter and 1.6 points from the second quarter of last year, while retention remained historically high at 87%. New business premiums of $275 million were down from a strong prior year quarter. For the most part, we attribute the new business dynamic to our underwriters prioritizing improving price, terms and conditions at renewal and being disciplined in managing risk selection related to our exposure to the auto line. We're very comfortable with our execution. We continue to invest in our strategic capabilities and are confident that we're well positioned to profitably grow over time. Page 18 of the webcast shows production statistics for our international markets across all three of Travelers' segments. Although, these statistics include more than Business Insurance, the overall trends are consistent with what we're seeing for the BI portion of international and reflect the rate risk selection, risk control and other measures we continue to execute to improve profitability. Lastly, I'd like to touch on our National Property business, which had a notable increase in new business this quarter. In this space, we've been seeing more opportunities in the marketplace and we've been selectively writing some of that. Importantly, many are accounts that we quoted or written before, so we're familiar with them and we're writing them at prices and on terms and conditions that meet our discipline standards. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong results. Segment income was $174 million, a decrease of $30 million due to a lower level of net favorable prior year development. The combined and underlying combined ratios were an excellent 74.9% and 81% respectively. Net written premiums for the quarter were up a very strong 9% with solid growth across all businesses. Considering the high quality of our Management Liability portfolio, we are pleased that the domestic retention remained at a historically high 90% with renewal premium change higher at 4.2%. New business for the quarter was a record $65 million, up 20% from the prior year quarter. These results reflect a successful execution of our various marketing, product and underwriting strategies to profitably grow these lines. Domestic Surety net written premiums were up 4% over a very strong prior year quarter. Our existing portfolio remains well positioned to continue to provide leading returns over time and our competitive advantages allow us to thoughtfully and selectively add quality new accounts. So Bond & Specialty results were strong and we feel terrific about our marketplace execution, competitive advantages and our ability to continue to deliver excellent results. And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. Personal Insurance grew income, revenue and policies in force in the second quarter with improved performance in both auto and home. Segment income for the second quarter of 2019 increased $105 million relative to the second quarter of 2018. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 100.2% an improvement of 4.7 points over the prior quarter, driven primarily by catastrophe levels that were nearly 7 points below last year. The underlying combined ratio of 94.6% was up 2 points from the prior year quarter driven by an increase in non-catastrophe weather losses and the impact on earned premiums related to the new Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaty partially offset by earned pricing net exceeded loss trend in agency automobile and a lower underwriting expense ratio. Weather losses in the aggregate were better than the prior year quarter and we're pleased with the overall results. Recall that the second quarter is our seasonally highest quarter in terms of expected weather losses. Turning to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter grew 6% with Agency Homeowners & Other leading the way with growth of 11%. Personal Insurance had strong retention in renewal premium change and record new -- domestic new business for the quarter. Agency Automobile once again delivered strong results with a combined ratio of 94% for the quarter, a 1.4 point improvement from the prior year period. The quarter benefited from a lower underlying combined ratio and lower catastrophe losses partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio continued to benefit from earned pricing that exceeded loss trend including continued favorable frequency trends. In Agency Homeowners & Other the second quarter combined ratio was 104.5%, 9.1 points lower than the prior quarter due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net -- favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by a higher underlying combined ratio. Higher non-catastrophe weather losses were the main driver of the 7.7 point increase in the underlying combined ratio to 92.9% as compared to the prior year quarter. While weather in total was favorable relative to the prior year quarter, a significant component of the weather activity came from non-PCS events this quarter in addition to PCS events that did not meet our catastrophe threshold. Turning to quarterly production. Agency Automobile retention remained solid at 84% with renewal premium change of 4.6% and a modest increase in new business from the prior year quarter. We remain focused on actions to grow this book at returns that continue to meet our objectives. Agency Homeowners & Other delivered another strong quarter. We achieved renewal premium change of 6.7% up 1.4 points from the first quarter and up 3 points from the second quarter of last year with retention remaining strong at 86%. The pricing we achieved reflects actions we're taking to address the higher loss activity that we and the industry have experienced in recent periods. New business was up 26% driven by our successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. QH2 continues to be well received and is performing as expected driven by sophisticated pricing segmentation and the ability for agents and customers to easily tailor the product to meet their needs. During the quarter we continue to make investments in the business. For example, we rolled out QH2.0 in three more states and the District of Colombia and QH2 is now available in 28 states. We remain on-track to complete the rollout in most of the remaining states later this year. In addition we announced several new initiatives. First, we've partnered with American Forests, the oldest National Conservation Organization in the U.S. to plant up to one million trees in connection with our initiative to encourage more customers to enroll in paperless billing, resulting in more efficiency for us, a better experience for them all while benefiting the environment. Second we're working with Wildfire Defense Systems to help provide loss prevention services in California that supplement local firefighters and other first responders in the event of a wildfire. This new service gives California policyholders an added layer of wildfire protection at no additional premium. It is also an additional tool to help us manage our exposure. These are the latest examples of initiatives that continue to position us well to deliver value in the eyes of the customer and to grow profitably while investing in the business. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks Michael. And thank you. We're ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is open. \nJay Gelb: Thanks and good morning. I'm sure people are going to have a fair amount of questions on the underlying combined ratio shift in 2Q year-over-year. I really think you explained it well in terms of the impact of non-cat weather and the tort environment deteriorating. I am wondering given the pace of price improvement, do you think at some point over the course of the rest of 2019 or 2020, we could see underlying margin improvement given how those trends are unfolding?\nAlan Schnitzer: You know, Jay, we give you an outlook for the underlying underwriting margin in the Outlook section of the 10-Q and we do it by segment. So you can see there -- what it is that we're thinking going forward. In particular where -- in BI where we're calling for continued improvement really it's three things it's non-cat weather, it's -- we would expect improved results in international. And in the fourth quarter of last year you've got the timing impact of the fourth quarter auto adjustments, but there is a lot of levers we have to pull to manage overall margins and profitability and including price terms and conditions and we're working on all those things relentlessly in the market every day and that will impact premium that we put on books and that also will earn in over time.\nJay Gelb: All right. That's helpful. Thanks. All right so expectations of continued improvement. And then I was wondering if you might have the rate impact or the rate benefit in domestic Business Insurance excluding the -- what I would imagine is a drag from workers' comp?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Jay workers\u2019 comp continued to be negative in the quarter. And we have given that as a separate statistic from time-to-time. We do it when we think it's relevant and we need to do it to clarify one thing or another. But there is some competitive sensitivity there and we don't intend to continue to update that number and probably would prefer not to give it to you now. But clearly the numbers that you see for rate in RPC and BI would be higher, but for workers' comp which is negative.\nJay Gelb: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Jay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMike Phillips: Thanks. Good morning. Two questions. First on the personal line side Agency Auto. I'm sure you saw a pretty decent expansion there of your core margin. And if I am reading correctly it sounds like your outlook calls for consistent levels of profitability into 2020. So I guess, could you talk about what you're seeing on the competitive environment sounds like it might be more competitive now than it was last year and sounds like if you're looking for consistent -- what is the profitability you're not concerned then with any rising in physical damage severity impacts in your margins there?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Mike. This is Michael Klein. I would say on the competitive environment we talked about it the last couple of quarters we certainly see as you can also find a moderation in rate increases being filed by our competitors. I think broadly speaking it's in pattern with the methods that we've been sending that we're moderating rate in response to the improved profitability. And I think we're working to be in step with the marketplace there. In terms of loss trend, we do continue to see upward pressure on severity in personal auto more than offset over the last couple of quarters with improvements in frequency. I think what we're working to do is to balance our pricing with the long-term view or trend over time and the outlook reflects the fact that we think we can do that and shift a little bit more growth in auto at attractive margins. So that's the view on our outlook. The one exception inside the outlook you'll note that we talk about the fourth quarter in particular and so I'll just remind you that as you look at the fourth quarter of 2019 and the comparison to 2018 there is a challenging year-over-year comparison there because we had both very strong quarter in terms of profitability in the quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recognized some of the favorable loss trend that we had been seeing throughout 2018. So there was a good guide catch-up in the fourth quarter of 2018. So broadly consistent with the exception of the fourth quarter which is really just a year-over-year comparison challenge.\nMike Phillips: Okay. Great. Thank you, Michael for the details there. Switching over then to workers comp you mentioned this time reserve development was from multiple accident years. I guess, one was there anything from accident year 2018 and anything from the first quarter of 2019 in that? And then, I guess, secondly on comp -- some competitors were talking about changing in loss trends maybe slightly getting worse and California recently came up with some uptick in severity in California. So I guess at what point do you become concerned on pretty substantial margin pressure in that line?\nDan Frey: So Mike, its Dan Frey. I'll take at least the first part of it on PYD, sort of, to clarify right so there wouldn't be anything in PYD from the first quarter of 2019. We'd count that as current year and we'd have called it out if there was a significant catch-up there. You k now, with the long-tail nature of workers' comp the majority of our prior year reserves development is going to have to come from years prior to 2018 just because you have a better chance to see how those were seasoning, but there is a small piece from 2018 as we see the favorability in some of the older years continue to bid into 2018.\nAlan Schnitzer: Mike, its Alan. On the loss trend of workers' comp -- I'd say broadly speaking it continues to behave well.\nMike Phillips: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. Couple of questions. First, probably for Greg. In your prepared commentary, I believe you said in addition to price you're getting tightened terms and conditions. If that's correct just want to clarify whether your disclosure of pricing changes is taking into account terms and conditions tightening as well?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yeah. Terms and conditions is all net inside our book of business yield. When we talk about terms and conditions, we're predominantly seeing that on the larger portion of the property segment. So think insured value, thing deductibles, all peril deductibles, sub-limits, so that's where we're seeing some of those terms and conditions improvement. So as we make those changes on the renewal block that certainly has an impact from a favorable point of view from a loss cost net on the book of business.\nAlan Schnitzer: Mike are you asking whether that's somehow adjusted in the rate number, is that your question?\nMike Zaremski: Yeah. If it's mathematically taken into account within the disclosure rate.\nAlan Schnitzer: It's not mathematic, I mean the rate numbers are pretty pure just price calculation, although to some extent it could show up on the exposure side, right? So if deductibles went up for example that would be negative for exposure, but it would not factor into the pure rate calculation.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. I may follow-up. And lastly on tort inflation, would you say it's gaining momentum in terms of the inflation rates? And do you think there are any underlying causes, I believe litigation finance there is a bunch of \u2013 there\u2019s couple of public firms and there's been a lot of capital raises there over the last couple of years and its gaining momentum as an asset class maybe that's one of the underlying drivers. If you have any thoughts there that would be helpful? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. So it's -- so what we're describing is the result of squaring triangles and coming up with numbers and then looking for causal factors in the environment. So there's a fair amount of estimation here and it's not -- there is no math formula that gets us to the answer to that question necessarily. But I would say broadly what we're reflecting in our numbers, we would describe it as a more active and more aggressive plaintiffs' bar. Now litigation finance is its own topic and we certainly read about, we can see numbers on that. We know more money is being raised for that as an asset class. We don't dismiss that as a factor. I will tell you that that is one aspect that at least now, this could change but at least now we're not seeing that as a particularly significant driver in what we're referring to as change in the tort environment. That could come. I mean we see the funds being raised for that. And so -- and by the way to the extent we see that and anticipate it that would get reflected in our loss PIKs as well, but we're not seeing that as a standout issue.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question going back to the Commercial Auto and GL PIKs that went up in the quarter. I guess what I'm trying to tie together is, A; the increase that you guys saw there and then also the commensurate increase in rate. So do you -- can you try to bucket I guess, how much of the rate was driven in your view off of just this higher loss trend environment because when we think about going forward it does sound like you guys are a bit more positive on pricing inflecting relative to loss trend in terms of just thinking about your outlook but if trend keeps going up that's going to, obviously, offset that rate versus trend phenomena?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. So, Elyse we did give you some perspective on outlook for RPC in the Outlook section of the 10-Q. And certainly everything we know about loss trend goes into our pricing models and our view of rate adequacy and our view what rate we need to achieve our return objectives. I will say that that does come in on a lag basis. We've got to see it, we've got to put it through in our models to the extent there are regulatory filings there's a process there then you got to put it on the book it's got a earn in. So there is a lag between the recognition of these trends and the time price goes into the market and gets -- is put on the books. So it's a long way of saying that Commercial Auto was at an inadequate return before we saw some of these trends it just got worse. And I think to a large degree, the pricing that we're seeing now is reflective of longer term trends in Commercial Auto, although some of what we're seeing in the quarter will be reflective of recent trends.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question, so you guys said the increase PIKs are about $20 million going forward that's about 50 basis points within Business Insurance. I know there is two buckets one being Commercial Auto and then one being the GL portion, but you guys did increase your Commercial Auto PIKs two quarters ago in the fourth quarter. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, the conservatism that you guys have now that this has been addressed and why -- maybe instead of half a point it's not one point that you chose to increase to your loss PIKs in the current quarter?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. Elyse our objective isn't missed at high or low. Our objective is always to get it right. We're trying to come up with an estimate of losses. We price the product based on an estimate of losses and an interest rate curve. And so our objective is always to get the right price. And so we weighed through a lot of data. We've got terrific actuaries and experts that help us think through this we've got management input on top of that. And our objective is to just get it right. So can we tell you, boy we swung a big stick at it and we're done this is it. No, we can't. But we can tell you that based on everything we see in the data. And based on our experience we think we got the PIKs in the right place.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bijan Moazami with Compass Point Research. Your line is open.\nBijan Moazami: Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I guess I want to understand a little bit more what's going on in the Commercial Auto business. In particular, you guys picked up a fair amount of premium volume this year and last year was it all great or was it something else? And this big pick up in BI severity is that broad-based? Or is it related to a subsection of the Commercial Auto or is it geographically located?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hi. This is Greg. Yes, Commercial Auto as you can see in the quarter, we had an 8% change in net written premium. The predominant dynamic underneath that is broad RPC across the portfolio. We're clearly seeing the Commercial Auto challenges that we believe the industry is also. So it really isn't a segment of the book. It's a broad dynamic and hence the reason why we've been achieving RPC, so broadly across it.\nBijan Moazami: Thank you. And then, regarding your $60 million reserve chart for environmental liability, I assume this is all pre-1986 and what's going on there?\nDaniel Frey: Hey It's Dan. I am not sure that it goes all back as far as pre-1986. It certainly in the year -- action years older than 2009, it's really a continuation of what we have seen in environmental over the last several years. We do see an improving environment in terms of the number of claims that come in. Because it is old, we do expect it's a runoff. The reaction here in this quarter is simply that things have not improved quite to the degree that we would have anticipated in our prior PIK. So you're right to think about this as mostly very old stuff. You're right to think about it as generally improving over time in terms of the volume of these things slowing down it just hasn't slowed quite to the degree that we had previously expected.\nBijan Moazami: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess is just on the renewal rate number sequentially. And I'm trying to get a feel for maybe how much of that increase just had to do with the mix of the premium that you wrote in the second quarter versus the first. Because I noticed that there was less workers' comp or you're obviously not getting rate but there is a lot more property, where I'm guessing the rate is better in the 3.6%. So is there anyway to kind of tease out the impact of just control for mix in that 3.6% versus the -- or the 130 basis point increase sequentially?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yeah. Ryan, this is Greg again. Comp wasn't off materially. And obviously every month we pride ourselves in our pricing to the local execution very granular partnership with our distributions. So it depends on the accounts that are coming up, the loss experience that's associated with them. And we do our best in partnering with them, but can't really say that there was a comp dynamic drive and that it was really the exposures that came up for renewal.\nRyan Tunis: And the exposure increase in workers' comp is it fair to kind of use the exposure increase for all of BI as a good barometer of what you're seeing in comp too?\nAlan Schnitzer: No. Not necessarily. And we don't disclose comp at that level, but not necessarily. But Ryan, I'm looking here for the data. My instinct is that there's not a big mix factor driving the overall rate change.\nRyan Tunis: Okay. That's helpful. And then Alan was my follow-up was particularly on interest rates. First, I'm curious what the new money yield is today for the company? And then second of all, just thinking about buybacks versus where the stocks trading, like I haven't seen it trade at this price-to-book valuation in quite some time. And I know, Alan you've always talked about structural returns in this business being linked to a certain extent to wherever interest rates are. And I guess we're back to very low levels of interest rates. So I'm curious looking into the back half of the year has your appetite for buybacks changed at all?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. Ryan, let me start with the buyback. And then I'll see if Bill wants to comment on the new money yields. But in terms of buybacks, our first objective for every dollar of capital that we generate is to invest it back in the business when we think we can do that and generate a return for it. And when we can, we're going to give it back to investors. And our alternative is to put that fixed income bond portfolio. And we don't think that's what our investors expect us to do. As between dividends and buybacks, we think, by and large buybacks is the preferred solution it's less diluted to book value per share. And so we're not trading in the stock. We're rightsizing capital. And we'll continue to do that. Of course we wouldn't be buying back stock. We thought the stock was trading at above intrinsic value and we don't. So, this really is -- it's not tactical. We're rightsizing capital. And it's a strategy to deliver shareholder value. And over the last 10 or 12 years we get this question from time-to-time when depending on where the stock is trading. And so this has come as a concern before or at least as a question before maybe not a concern. And I would just point out, since '06 we bought back something like $35 million worth of stock and at an average price per share of I think $66 or $67 a share. So we feel pretty good that we've bought the stock back thoughtfully in a way that's create -- created shareholder value and no change in our philosophy. Bill, do you want to comment on new money?\nBill Heyman: Yeah. Ryan in terms of new money yields, in the second quarter the new money yield was between 3% and 3.25%. It ended the quarter what was the bottom of that range and it's probably about there now. We think more in terms of the relationship between new money yields and mature yields. And obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year we were reinvesting at book yields comfortably above money running off. We were above in this first quarter, but less so, but obviously in the second quarter we slipped below and rates were at the lowest point in that cycle. To measure the gap and on a daily basis, it's random, so we do it over periods. We look at the curve and spreads. We look at what is running off. We look at the mix of assets we're buying, which also changes. And we also look at sales we're making in the market, and we do make some sales, especially in areas where the tax reform act changed the profitability to us of certain products. I can tell you that the gap as we measure it is in excess of 50 basis points and can run higher than that.\nAlan Schnitzer: And Ryan the net effect of everything built this year was in the outlook for NII that Dan shared in his prepared remarks and that's in the outlook section of the 10-Q. So that would all be reflected in that number.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Pardon me, good morning. So quick question I guess on the workers' compensation reserve release. It's on a perfect comparison, but Schedule P showed $625 million-or-so of releases in full year 2018 for workers' compensation. So it seems like the pace is picking up and I was wondering is that because of more conservative PIKs or incrementally better observed loss trends?\nDan Frey: Hi. It's Dan. I wouldn't say more conservative loss PIKs. I would say, we're simply doing what we always do which is every quarter we're going to go through all the data as it comes in relative to the expectations that we had in the previous set of PIKs. Clearly, we've moved over time favorably in prior year reserve development in workers' comp. We do take those things and reflect them in our most recent views. What you see this quarter is simply another quarter's worth of data where things have come in more favorably than what we would have embedded in the prior PIK. I don't think this is in anyway the unwinding of some increase in conservatism in prior PIKs.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess this is for Michael. When we -- if we take out the Personal Auto and Agency Homeowners from total personal lines, it seems like the remainder, the direct-to-consumer and international actually saw about 200 basis point in the quarter loss ratio on a year-over-year basis, excluding catastrophes and reserve development. Is that mix? Is that international?\nMichael Klein: So we obviously disclosed the segment, we disclosed the components and you're talking about the delta. I would say, -- and we sort of talked about this in past quarters, the Canada -- the international book, which is predominantly Ontario auto, but broadly Canada has been underperforming. We're being impacted there by similar trends and experience that you've heard others in the industry talk about. We've got a game plan to work to improve that, but it's a challenging environment. I will say on a positive note, we've got the seven point rate increase approved by Ontario earlier this year. We have another rate increase on file with the regulators as we speak. And through that and some distribution management and underwriting actions, we're working to improve the performance there. But yeah, the delta there is really a drag primarily from international.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. Going to the rate improvement in Business Insurance, so I think you said that it's currently in excess of loss trends on a written basis. Considering the fact that loss trends have moved up over the last couple of quarters at least, I guess, what quarter was the inflection point in terms of achieving rate in excess of trends?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. Yaron, that's a hard one to pick here on the fly. We're talking about going back and looking at it. We've said for a few quarters that they were close one way or the other, a couple of quarters ago when we said, written was a little bit ahead of trend. It was -- now based on our new view, it's probably a little bit behind trend. Exactly what quarter-to-date the inflection point is hard to pick. There is a lot of estimation in all of it. We can tell you that as you heard Greg say in his prepared remarks, where we are today and it's not just rate, it's rate and exposure. Where we are today even taking into account our updated view of loss trend we feel like on a return basis, we're expanding margins.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. That's helpful. And then, if we turn to homeowners, so the deterioration in the loss ratio comes in the face of strong net premiums written growth and the quantum to product and in-home. Is the quantum product and is the growth strategy performing as expected? And is it just a matter of severe non-cat weather that's kind of thrown a wrinkle this quarter or -- I want to stop there.\nMichael Klein: Sure, and this is Michael. I would say the short answer to your question is yes, the Quantum Home 2.0 product is performing as expected as we monitor the loss experience there and in particular the data that's most credible still at this early stages is frequency, but the loss experience is performing as we expected in the product. And in this quarter really the miss on underlying is actually more than explained by the non-cat weather variance. I will take a step back and just talk to you sort of more broadly about homeowners profitability and just remind everybody that we have been talking about a bit of pressure on underlying loss experience in property some of that weather-related, some of that non-weather water-related. And while non-weather water wasn't a significant impact this quarter, it doesn't mean it's gone away. And so that's behind my comments about continuing to drive for price change in homeowners in order to address some of those underlying profitability challenges. But again, we think it's really weather-related and a little bit of non-weather water-related less about the product itself.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Thank you very much.\nMichael Klein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.\nAmit Kumar: Thanks and good morning. Maybe two quick follow-ups on the total climate. The first question I have is what should give us confidence that I guess adverse trend line will not spread across other segments. Is it more so the inherent I guess nature of Commercial Auto which leaves it open to the plaintiffs' bar chasing it? Or what else is going on, on a bit more deeper basis?\nAlan Schnitzer: Amit, I think we have said in prior quarters that we do see this thematically across liability lines. So whether it's bodily injury severity in personal auto or whether it's the CMP product or -- we have said we see it broadly. But we've also said that this is driven by a Commercial Auto underlying dynamic and the reason -- and I think we went into this a little bit in the fourth quarter, but the reason is there's a high degree of homogeneity to those losses. And so in terms of the plaintiffs' bars business model, there is just a lot of attractiveness to that as compared to other claims. Slip and fall for example, where it's going to be highly dependent or -- anyway more dependent on facts and circumstances and it's a little bit more complicated to litigate. But again, as we've said in the past, we do see this thematically and we are taking that into account in all of our loss PIKs. Just so far, it's been for the most part a Commercial Auto dynamic.\nAmit Kumar: Got it. The second question and my only question is, if you look at the pass trend lines and I think all of us have lived through adverse total climate, is your margin guidance -- is the thought process that it stabilizes here or are we at an inflection point? Or what should give us confidence that this does not deteriorate or continue to deteriorate further and then sort of swing back? I mean, how do we think about the inflection point here on this slide? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Amit, Greg did say in his prepared remarks that we did increase our loss PIKs for BI as a consequence of what we're hearing. So we are -- we think that the starting point was higher and the inflation rate from here is higher. As I said in my answer to a prior question, do we think we've taken care of all of this? We think so otherwise we would have done something different. Having said that, we're not trying to be aggressive or conservative. We're trying to get it right. Our loss estimates or yield losses go into our pricing. And so it's important that we sharpen the pencil and put our very best estimate on it and that's what we've done. And I think you can look back over some number of years in our business and our track record and whether it's in Commercial Auto or whether it's in Personal Auto or other issues, this is insurance loss estimates and underlying loss, I'm sure are going to change. And all you can hope is that you've got the right data, the right analytics, the right experience and the right expertise to see it and react to it. And we think if you look back over time in our business, we've done a pretty good job of reacting to that. And this -- it's unfortunate when it happens, but that's the business we're in and we think that we've done all the right things.\nAmit Kumar: I got the answer I was looking for. Thank you so much and good luck for the future.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Amit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Thanks, Alan. I'm just curious here. Looking at the middle market, new business down year-over-year, little bit of deterioration to retentions, are you guys starting to dig in your heels a little bit more right now just on pricing in terms and conditions? Maybe kind of like we start to see happen back in 2011. Greg, it doesn't seems like an extreme situation. But is that -- should we expect kind of new business to continue to kind of be more challenging here going forward maybe retention start to deteriorate a little bit?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey Brian, this is Greg. First, when you do that math, you're looking down from a really strong period in the prior year and we've shared with you in the past all those strategic initiatives we've been executing in the business really to free up our underwriters and give them more capacity to be active in the marketplace. The word active, we'll use based on different environments in the business. Right now, active is really addressing what you said making sure that we do have the right terms and conditions and most importantly, the right adequate price on the product. And so, our underwriters have been using a lot of that capacity right now to improve the margins on the business and we think in terms of the book of business and your question on retention, we think it's a really high-quality book of business. And we do everything possible to work with our distributors to try to keep those retention levels up there while improving the margins on the business also.\nAlan Schnitzer: I would like to point out 2011 was a very different environment in terms of where we were in terms of rate adequacy and returns. So, it's difficult to draw a comparison. Every point in the cycle is different and I'm not sure there's a lot of comparison.\nBrian Meredith: Got you, got you. And then, second question just quickly here. I know you guys are in Q2, but you do have an excess surplus line through a non-admitted carrier. Can you give us any differentiation between those two markets as far as what you're seeing happening in non-admitted versus admitted? What you're seeing...\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes Brian, this is Greg again. Sure. We see some of the industry statistics also where there has been an uptick in some of the larger states from a non-admitted point of view. Just as a reminder, we have two areas where we write non-admitted business. One in our north field business which is a less complex solution, a smaller business exposure you can think of it that way. And then we also use the non-admitted business across our property book of business. But as you said, certainly not a real big part of our product strategy. And that's because, we think, we've got really modular and customized product offerings and what we need to do to address terms and conditions in this market, our product portfolio has been able to do that. So, we've been comfortable with that portfolio mix.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have completed the allotted time for questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Abbe Goldstein for closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. As always, if you have any follow-up, please feel free to get in touch with Investor Relations and have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Welcome to the First Quarter 2019 Results Teleconference For Travelers. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 18, 2019. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers discussion of our first quarter 2019 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investor section.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investor section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our 30,000 employees are engaged in executing on our focus strategic priorities and we're seeing the impacts. As we've explained in the past, our strategic efforts are geared towards creating attractive top line opportunities and improving productivity and efficiency. The strong results we delivered across all our business segments this quarter reflect progress on both fronts. Net income for the quarter of $796 million was up 19% over the prior year quarter, generating return on equity of 13.5%, the highest level in two years. Core income was $755 million, up 11% and core return on equity was 13%, also the highest level in two years. The underwriting gain of $395 million pretax is up more than 50% over the prior year quarter, reflecting higher business volumes and a lower combined ratio. Earned premiums were up 5% to a first quarter record of $6.9 billion with each of our business segments contributing. The combined ratio of 93.7% improved by nearly 2 points. The underlying combined ratio improved almost a point to 91.6% with strong results in each of our business segments. Notably, we achieved improvements in productivity and efficiency in each of the segments. Our high-quality investment portfolio performed well, generating net investment income of $496 million after-tax. While slightly below the results in prior year quarter due to lower private equity returns, net investment income benefited from higher fixed income return. Our strong results this quarter contributed to growth in book value per share of 7% and growth in adjusted book value per share of 2% after returning $625 million of excess capital to shareholders consistent with our long-standing capital management strategy. Turning to production, we remain very pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies. During the quarter, we grew gross written premiums to a record $7.8 billion, an increase of 6%. Net written premiums, which reflect the impact of the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty, we discussed with you last quarter, were $7.1 billion, up 3%. Our premium growth once again reflects high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change. That speaks of the high quality of the business we're putting on the books. In Business Insurance, gross written premiums increased by 6%, as we achieved renewal premium change of 6%, including renewal rate change of more than 2%. For both rate and RPC, those were the highest levels in almost five years. As you might expect the price increases were led by the Commercial Auto and property lines, but with the exception of Workers' Comp, rate was up both year-over-year and sequentially in each of our product lines. That's the result of granular and deliberate execution to meet our return objectives. We'll continue to see great gains selectively and thoughtfully and in close coordination with our distribution partners. Importantly, we are encouraged that while we were improving margins, we maintained retention at historical highs and generated a higher level of new business. In our consistently high-performing Bond & Specialty business, gross written premiums were up 4%, driven by historically high levels of both retention and new business in our domestic Management Liability business. Surety premium volume was at high levels in both the current and prior year quarters. In Personal Insurance, which as you know is a great story, gross written premiums were up 6%, reflecting strong results in both our agency auto and Agency Homeowners businesses. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results. Lastly, I'm pleased to report that as a reflection of confidence in our business, our Board of Directors has declared a 6.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.82 per share, marking 15 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of more than 9% over that period. To sum it up, our first quarter performance has a terrific start to the year. We generated strong results in terms of both profits and returns. On top of that, we had another quarter of excellent production. Our performance, competitive advantages and commitment to innovation position us to continue delivering industry-leading results over time. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dan.\nDaniel Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $755 million, up 11% from $678 million in the prior year quarter. And core ROE was up 13%, up from 11.9%. Earnings per share and core earnings per share were up 24% and 15%, respectively. These improvements resulted from lower catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and lower private equity returns. Pretax underlying underwriting gain, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, increased by 16%, driven by improvements in all three segments. Underlying results benefited from higher business volumes and the consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91.6% improved by 0.8 point from the prior year quarter, driven by a lower expense ratio. Successful execution of our productivity and efficiency initiatives resulted in improved operating leverage as insurance G&A expenses were nearly flat, while net earned premiums grew by 5%. Our first quarter results include $193 million of pretax catastrophe losses, down significantly from $354 million in last year's first quarter. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first quarter was $51 million pretax, down from $150 million in the prior year quarter. In Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $69 million pretax resulted primarily from better-than-expected performance in auto. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $21 million pretax compares to net favorable PYD of $66 million pretax in the prior year quarter. The change primarily resulted from the enactment of the Child Victims Act in New York during the first quarter. This legislation extends the statutory limitations for cases of child sexual abuse, creating potential exposure to claims in the general liability line that were previously time-barred. Excluding the impact of the New York law change, Business Insurance would have reported net favorable prior year reserve development, workers' comp had net favorable reserve development, Commercial Auto was largely unchanged and commercial multi-parallel had modest net unfavorable reserve development. Pretax net investment income decreased by 3% from the prior year quarter to $582 million, as higher fixed income returns were more than offset by lower returns in our nonfixed income portfolio. Fixed income NII increased by $39 million pretax due to the higher average yield on invested assets and an increase in the amount of average invested assets. Lower returns in the private equity portfolio reflected the market downturn in the fourth quarter of 2018, as these private equity results are generally reported to us and consequently by us on a quarter lag. As we discussed on our earnings call last quarter, we added a new catastrophe reinsurance treaty for 2019, providing coverage for PCS-designated events for which we incur $5 million or more in losses, above an aggregate retention of $1.3 billion. The cost of this new treaty is reflected in ceded premiums, and that is the primary reason that the growth rate in net written premiums is less than the growth rate in gross written premiums this quarter. Because the ceded written premium is all recorded up front, this impact will not recur in the remaining quarters of the year. On an earned premium basis, the new reinsurance treaty will affect the results of all four quarters in 2019. Most loss recoveries from this treaty would likely benefit our net cat losses, which are excluded from underlying results. Based on our assumed weather losses for the year, the treaty would have about 0.5 point adverse impact on the full year underlying combined ratio but a minimal impact on the full year total combined ratio. And we assume that any recoveries would likely only benefit the second half of the year. Of course, the effect on our underlying and total combined ratios for 2019 will be impacted by the level of PCS events we actually experience. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $639 million were, again, very strong, all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion. Holding company liquidity is temporarily elevated as we issued $500 million of 30-year debt at 4.1%, ahead of our upcoming $500 million debt maturity in June. We took advantage of attractive market rates and issued the new debt in early March. So we're carrying an artificially high level of holding company liquidity exiting the first quarter that will naturally adjust itself before the end of the second quarter. In terms of the unrealized gain, interest rates decreased during the first quarter. And as a result, we went from a net unrealized investment loss of $113 million after-tax at year-end to $1 billion after-tax unrealized gain as of March 31. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $89.09 at March 31, 2% higher than at year-end. We returned $625 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $421 million and dividends of $204 million. And as Alan noted, the Board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.77 per share to $0.82 per share. So across all key measures, we remain pleased with our strong financial position. And with that, I'll turn the microphone over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a strong first quarter as reflected in our underwriting and production results. As you heard Alan say, both renewal rate change and renewal premium change were at the highest levels in almost five years. Significantly, we achieved that while maintaining a very strong retention levels. And importantly, we also continue to invest in strategic initiatives to position us for the future. Segment income for the quarter was $414 million, while the combined ratio was 98.1%. The underlying combined ratio of 95% improved by 0.5 point from the prior year quarter, even after the impact on earned premium from the new cat reinsurance treaty. The treaty increased the underlying combined ratio by 0.5 point, split about evenly between the loss ratio and expense ratio. Let me break the underlying combined ratio down a bit further. The underlying loss ratio was 0.8 point higher than the prior year quarter, driven by about a point of elevated losses in our international business. I'll provide some additional comments on international in just a minute. In addition, the change in the underlying loss ratio also included a little more than 0.5 point from lower non-cat weather losses, which was mostly offset by the impact of the new cat treaty as well as a little less than 0.5 point from higher Commercial Auto loss estimates consistent with the reestimates we reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. Auto losses for the quarter were generally in line with our expectations. The underlying expense ratio was favorable to the prior year quarter by 1.3 points, about 0.5 of which was driven by continued growth in premium volumes while maintaining generally flat insurance G&A expense dollars. The other half of the improvement resulted from the benefit this quarter related to a state assessment. Before I turn to the top line in production, I'll spend a minute more on what we're seeing in our international business. For a couple quarters in a row now, we've shared with you that we've experienced some elevated loss activity. These losses are predominantly property-driven and have come primarily from a small number of large losses into a lesser degree higher attritional losses. We're pursuing meaningful rate increases to address what we believe to be industry-wide challenges. In addition, we're applying risk selection and risk control measures in response to the losses we're seeing and taking targeted actions to exit certain lines and accounts. These measures are well underway, and our production results in these market reflect the progress we're making in our efforts to improve profitability. Now to the top line. Gross written premiums for the quarter were up 6% over the prior year, reflecting strong production results. We continue to be pleased with the impact that our strategic initiatives are having and creating opportunities for us to grow the top line profitably. In terms of domestic production, we achieved strong renewal premium change of 6% in the quarter, including renewal rate change of 2.2%. The renewal rate change of 2.2% was up 0.6 point from both the prior year and the fourth quarter, with the Commercial Auto and property lines leading the way. Importantly, at the same time as we achieved these pricing increases, we maintained historically high retentions of 86%. In addition to what you see in RPC, we've also been improving terms and conditions, particularly in our large property business, which improves the risk profile of the book. New business was a very healthy $564 million. We're pleased with our production results, which reflect our thoughtful balance towards retaining our best business, improving pricing where we need to in order to meet our return objectives and pursuing attractive new business opportunities. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change and renewal rate change, both remain consistent with the past several quarters, while retention remained strong at 83%. New business was strong and comparable to the prior year quarter. We're pleased with the returns in this business and the production results reflect our strategic execution. In Middle Market, renewal premium change was 6% with renewal rate of 2.2%, up 0.7 point from the prior year and 0.6 point from the fourth quarter, while retention remained historically high at 87%. New business premiums of $336 million were up 4% from the prior year quarter. Building on the success from the business centers in Commercial Accounts, we begun to roll out the utilization of the same centers across several of our other Middle Market businesses. As with Commercial Accounts, the goal is to be more active in the marketplace by creating additional capacity for our field underwriters to partner with our agents and brokers to create more solutions for our customers. To sum up, a strong start of the year for Business Insurance, and we continue to feel great about our execution in the marketplace. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of strong results. Segment income was $138 million and both the combined and underlying combined ratios were an excellent 81.1%. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 2%, driven by continued growth in our domestic Management Liability business. Considering the high quality of our Management Liability portfolio, we are pleased that the domestic retention remained high at 89% with renewal premium change up 3.6%. New business continued at historically high levels and up 6% from the prior year quarter. Surety premiums were strong in both the current and prior year quarters, and we remain well positioned to capitalize on potential increases in public infrastructure investments. So Bond & Specialty results were strong. We feel great about our marketplace execution, competitive advantages and our ability to continue delivering leading returns and profitable growth. And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Personal Insurance is off to a great start in 2019, with strong profitability and solid production. Segment income was $278 million, the highest quarterly total in a decade and an improvement of $149 million over the first quarter of 2018. Our combined ratio of 90.1% improved 7.4 points, driven by lower catastrophes, improved underlying underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was 89.1%, an improvement of 1.4 points even after an 80 basis point impact from the new catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Turning the top line. Gross written premiums grew 6%, demonstrating continued momentum in the segment. Net written premiums were up 2% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of the new cat treaty. The impact is more pronounced in Agency Homeowners and other, where net written premiums grew 1% compared to gross written premium growth of 9%. Agency Automobile delivered an impressive quarter with a combined ratio of 89.4%, 5.4 points better than the prior year quarter and the best result in more than 10 years. The quarter benefited from higher net favorable prior year reserve development and very strong underlying results. The underlying combined ratio of 92.1% improved 4.2 points relative to the prior year quarter due primarily to earned pricing exceeding loss trend, including the benefit from continued improvements and observed frequency levels. Just as a brief reminder, the first quarter underlying auto combined ratio is typically the lowest of the year. We're also very pleased with our first quarter results in Agency Homeowners and other, where our combined ratio improved by more than 10 points from the prior year quarter to 88.2%, driven by lower catastrophes. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was a solid 82.6%. The increase of 2.4 points versus the prior year quarter primarily reflects the impact of the new cat treaty. Turning to quarterly production. Agency Automobile retention remained solid at 84% with renewal premium change of 5.1% and a 7% increase in new business from the prior year quarter. We're encouraged by these production results as we work to grow the line at returns that continue to meet our objectives. Agency Homeowners and other delivered strong production results as well, with retention at 85%, renewal premium change up over 0.5 from the fourth quarter and increased momentum in new business, driven primarily by the successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. Our Quantum Home 2.0 product is now available in 25 states versus 3 states at this time last year. We're on track to launch the product in most of the remaining states by year-end, including enhancements like our expanded smart home discount and home sharing endorsement, both of which we've introduced since the initial launch. To date, the product is performing well both in terms of marketplace reception by agency and customers and in terms of production and profitability. To recap, we're pleased to be off to a great start to the year in Personal Insurance and are well positioned to grow profitably, while continuing to invest in the business. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael, and thank you. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.\nJay Gelb: In domestic Business Insurance renewal - the renewal rate change. So it was good to see that, that rate change accelerated in the first quarter and you mentioned that was largely due to Commercial Auto and property with an offset from workers' compensation. We've seen in the past how that's gone up comparatively one quarter versus the prior quarter and then has shifted down over time. Do you think this has momentum to stay at this level or potentially increase? Or do you think this might be more of a onetime boost?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Jay, it's Alan. If you go back and think about when we started talking about rate most recently beginning of 2017, and we said then we were starting to push for rate. And if you plot out the line for either rate or rate and RPC, you'll see an upward sloping line and that's been very deliberate on our part. I shared in my prepared remarks that we intend to continue to push for renewal rate change and just in terms of managing the returns. Now we are getting some help from exposure and that counts to both in terms of the component of exposure, behaves like rate and the expense leverage we get from it. And if you see in the outlook section of the 10-Q that we filed, you'll see that we've - we're calling for higher RPC there as well. I mean, that's a single number. There's a lot of texture underneath. We're forecasting essentially nine months out, so who knows, but we're going to continue to push in this direction.\nJay Gelb: All right. Great. High RPCs. And then separate question on Small Commercial. We've seen a number of potential competitors looking to move into Small Commercial on a direct basis like Berkshire Hathaway and Progressive. What's your perspective on how much that business could shift to the direct channel given that Travelers primary presence on that is clearly an independent agent?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Jay, this is Greg. Small Commercial marketplace has always been a competitive section of the marketplace, and we obviously are monitoring, assessing all the competitors that enter that space. And we make the assumption that some of them are going to be successful, and we accordingly manage to that way. And in terms of channel preference, we're not seeing any material shift of channel preference right now. We believe we've got a model that's very effective, and we're investing to make it as frictionless as possible. So wherever the consumer ultimately goes in the future, we think we're going to be positioned very well.\nJay Gelb: Okay. Including direct?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Correct.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: I'll take a shot at this one. First, on the PYD. Any chance you can give the dollar impact on the New York law change?\nDaniel Frey: Mike, it's Dan. I think we're going to not be real specific on that given that it's an issue that we expect to be involved in legislation over a particular coverage matter. We did try to give you at least direction of magnitude. Early in the press release, I think we talk about the year-over-year change in PYD, which on a pretax basis was pretty close to $100 million being primarily attributable to the Child Victims Act. And in our minds, that means more than half. But I think to get much tighter than that, would be more detail than we want to give.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. No, I appreciate that. On the Workers' Comp PYD, was any of that from accident year '18?\nDaniel Frey: That's a good question. Of the top of my head, I will tell you in one second. Comp, '18 is a very young year on a longtail line. So not a lot of movement in '18. Favorability and workers' comp is some recent accident years, but that's a little too recent for us to be making much of a change.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. And then, I guess, on the Business Insurance, sticking with that for a second. Well, if you move in parts on the expense ratio from - you mentioned in the Q, the Simply Business expansion, the state assessment and such. I guess, is there a way for us to maybe help us think about how kind of a good run rate going forward would be? I don't know how much the state assessment was or how much the Simply Business expansion is worth and that kind of thing because it's a good expense ratio with a lot of moving parts there.\nDaniel Frey: Yes, so it's Dan again. I guess I'll think about expense ratio more than enterprise level. And from a high level, we gave you some outlook at the end of last year, which was - expect in this year to be broadly consistent with what we saw last year. Last year, as an enterprise, we're at about a 30.1. This year, in the first quarter, it's a 29.7. There's a little bit of a benefit, as Greg mentioned, from this state assessment change would have put - you could think about that as 20 or 30 basis points back into the expense ratio. This is an example of things can be a little bit lumpy from one quarter to the next. We're happy with the expense ratio in the first quarter, but not taking that as a permanent improvement versus what we had expected previously.\nAlan Schnitzer: Okay. Mike, just - just as a point of clarification, Mike that the Simply Business investment wouldn't be any expense ratio, just for clarification.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. No, I guess, I was reading something out of the Q that said part of your G&A expense was due to expansion in Simply Business. That's what I was referring to.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, that's - it's G&A, but there's - all of G&A doesn't go into the expense ratio, Insurance G&A does. We can take it off-line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question. I wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary on the renewal premium change within Business Insurance. So your outlook is now more positive for the year. If we go back, you guys did see a slowdown in the third and the fourth quarter on the renewal rate, which picked up this quarter. I know Commercial Auto and Property have been lines that are getting price for some time. So I'm just trying to get a better sense of what really drove the sequential increase and gave you conviction to raise your outlook for the rest of 2019?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Elyse, this is Greg. First of all, the outlook, as a reminder, is an estimate. And so we try to give you as much transparency in our best dealer around where that's going to go on a going forward basis. And if you look at the webcast slide for domestic BI, overall, you can see that the 6% for the first quarter, we think, is a terrific number and is the highest number on the page. And as Alan just said, we're going to continue pursuing our margin improvement campaign going forward also.\nAlan Schnitzer: And Elyse, I would add that the rate increases are pretty broad other than workers' comp. So all products other than workers' comp higher sequentially and year-over-year, rate increases on a higher percentage of overall accounts, for example. So it's reasonably broad-based, although rational by product line relative with the returns we're getting in those lines.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's great. And then my second question on international. You guys pointed to about one point of underlying margin drag within Business Insurance from your international business. I mean, you did give some color on steps that you're taking to look to improve the margins there. Can you just talk to time frame? I'm assuming there's a certain level of drag that's embedded within your outlook for the next three quarters of the year? And just how long you think those initiatives will take to work their way through your book of business?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Elyse, this is - it's probably more precise than either we could get or would want to share on that. We're - we've got all the efforts focused on it. We're working on it. And we're - there is an assumption that some of what we saw in the first quarter was an aberration and a return to more normal levels reasonably quickly. And there's other work that we're going to be doing, that's going to take some more time. But to give you any more precision than that would probably be - would probably give you a set of precisions that just doesn't exist.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then in terms of the size of the first quarter losses, would you put it kind of in line with the fourth quarter of last year?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think at least we're going to stick with the one point that Greg shared in his prepared remarks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: My question is just on this whole discussion around rate. And I guess, for Alan, are we at a point where the better-than-expected rate, the acceleration as you've been factoring into the way you're thinking about your outlook this year for margins? Or is it more just you're taking the rate where you need it, where you're seeing some elevated losses you're responding to it. So broadly, this is just a type of rate you essentially need to be able to keep things broadly consistent or certainly better on the year?\nAlan Schnitzer: Ryan, if I understand your question, I think the answer is yes to both. The rate we're getting when - and we give you some perspective by segment in the outlook, and we give you some perspective on the outlook for margin in the outlook. And that does - the outlook we give you on margin does take into account, as best as we can tell what we're going to achieve in terms of rate and exposure.\nRyan Tunis: But it doesn't seem that the outlook for margins has changed materially despite the better - I guess the better rate we're seeing this quarter. So just trying to reconcile - I mean, how exactly are you thinking about the 22? Was - it's just, I guess, what was needed? Or do you feel better about what margins are going to be here in 2019 than you did when we talked at the fourth quarter call?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, again, to both. Yes, we feel good about the 22, and we feel great about the 6 points of overall pricing. If you go back and look at over - if you go back and look over a decade and you look at what rate and RPC have done, you'd say 6 point surprises. It's pretty good by historical standards and particularly when you think about the fact that in '16 - end of '16 into '17, total price actually never went negative. So before it went negative, it started moving back up. So we feel good about what we're achieving, and we feel good about returns. Ryan, if you take the results in the quarter, and if you normalize for prior year development and weather, you get a pretty good result. And so we'd be probably a little bit less than what we printed because there were some other good things that happened, but you get a pretty good results. So we don't look at the returns that we're generating on a consolidated basis today and say they're disappointing. But as we look out the windshield into the future, we think there's more work to do in terms of achieving our objective of mid-teens over time. And so we're not disappointed with the 22, we're not disappointed with the six. And we're going to keep pushing. There's more work to do.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: A couple of questions here for you. First one, Personal Auto. I noticed your outlook underlying margins looks for some deterioration for the rest of the year on auto. I'm just curious why is that? Is it because you're seeing the elevated severities, is that what you're kind of factoring?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Brian, it's Michael Klein. No, it's actually not due to that. It's actually pretty consistent with the outlook we gave for the full year and has a lot to do with seasonality in the auto business. So when we gave the outlook for the full year, we said that auto experience would likely be better than the prior year in the first half and worse than the prior year in the second half. And this is really just a reflection of the first quarter rolling off. And now, we're just looking at the 9 months versus the 9 months.\nBrian Meredith: So you're not seeing any issues with severity or anything?\nMichael Klein: When you look at severity, I would say we continue to see some of the same things you're seeing in the industry, physical damage, repair costs continue to be rising, but they have been - when you look underneath that, you see a little bit of a shift in vehicles towards heavier vehicles and SUVs. You see higher repair costs due to improvements in technology and more technology in the vehicle. So we think that those severity trends sort of are persisting. The good news and we referred to this in our comments, is that frequency has continued to be better than expected and is - in the quarter was an offset to that and part of the result that we produced in Q1. But, again, the outlook is really just a quarter dropping off and consistent with the outlook that we had for the full year.\nBrian Meredith: Got you. And then basically going back to the reserve development and business charts on the Childs Victim Act. Is that kind of - when you think about the charts, are you thinking about kind of on a national basis because of the law change there in New York? Or is it possible that this law in New York legislative action spreads to other states? And could it get worse?\nDaniel Frey: Brian, so it's Dan. So to be clear, this reaction in the first quarter is to the New York change only, right? So we are setting reserves actuarially and from an accounting standards perspective based on what the law is. We're aware that there are a number of other states that have discussed possible similar legislation on a go-forward basis and are keeping a close eye on those. If more states enact, we would react accordingly as other states react. The one that looks to be sort of in the nearest term potentially ready to go would be New Jersey. We've made an assessment of New Jersey and would expect that to not be anywhere near the magnitude of what we just recognized for New York. But it's an ongoing issue in a number of states that we're keeping an eye on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski: Follow-up to Brian's question on personal lines. So auto results continued to outperform and that feels to be like an industry-wide trend. Maybe you can comment on if you expect the competitive environment there just to naturally get tougher? And then switching to the other side of personal lines, homeowner's results on underlying basis are deteriorating and it seems also be industry-wide trend and pricing does seem to be moving little north there. So I know those - you guys are mostly a bundled product shop. Maybe you can talk to whether those two conflicting trends there? And whether you feel that personal lines can start growing more for you guys going forward?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Mike. Again, it's Michael Klein. And I think certainly sort of two components there. I will start with the segment, right? We're really pleased with the positioning of the segment. We are growing policies in the segment, growing premium in the segment and really had a terrific start to the year in terms of the total segment. If you look at the pieces, the auto competitive environment, certainly, we compete in that market every day. I think if you use competitive rate filings as the proxy for a level of competitiveness and you look at that data, you see that rate filings in the industry - the file rate for the industry is down period to period and continues to be lower increases in aggregate than the industry had filed for in the past. The aggregate, I think, 12-month rolling rate increase for the industry now is below 2%. So that could be a proxy for the competitive environment in auto. And maybe just an additional comment on the outlook. While our outlook is for a higher combined ratio in the next 9 months than the prior 9 months, it's still a target return. So to your point, we're seeking to grow in the auto line. We're executing on marketing, distribution and marketplace execution strategies to do that. And as I said, the production results demonstrate improvements in new business, strong retention, moderating pricing that, I think, is all consistent with that view. On the home side, again, most of the deterioration in underlying from the first quarter of last year is explained by the treaty. And so that's most of it. If you actually remove the treaty impact from the underlying combined ratio and compare that to history, it's very consistent with our long-run average underlying combined ratio in home. That said, there's some period-to-period volatility there. There is still some pressure in nonweather water loss activity, which we have talked about which is part of why you see RPC rising and why we're focusing on improving RPC as we go forward. But, again, I think we're very pleased with the performance of the property portfolio and the path we're on. And then conversely to the auto outlook that I described, the property outlook, again, mostly just because of the quarterization of the outlook is for better results on an underlying basis in property for the balance of the year sort of going the other away from auto. And when you put those two together, you get a better combined ratio outlook year-on-year.\nMichael Zaremski: Got it. It's helpful. I did see the improved commentary in the outlook. One follow-up on commercial pricing. Thanks for the insights on Commercial Auto and Property driving the pricing increases. But I was wondering on workers' comp pricing, is that getting quarter-over-quarter more or less negative?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Mike, this is Greg. Yes, we really aren't going to share workers' comp on an individual line and the price and just because it is such an offensive dynamic of how we compete in the marketplace. We have in the past I've shared, and it's pretty evident that there's been very good loss results in workers' comp and there has been reductions in the market. So if you look at our RPC at 6%, clearly ex workers' comp, we'd be higher than that, and we really aren't going to disclose the individual product lines going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery.\nLawrence Greenberg: For Michael, again, on auto. And if you answered it, I apologize. But is written premium - written auto pricing keeping up with loss trend?\nMichael Klein: I don't know if I spoke specifically to written keeping up with loss trend, but certainly, on an earned business, we continue to expand margins. And on a written basis at 5 points of RPC, I would say we're continuing to expand margins on both basis. I didn't speak specifically to that, but we feel good about the margin expansion. And again, the outlook is for auto to produce target returns.\nLawrence Greenberg: Great. And then in Bond & Specialty, I know the PYD jumps around quite a bit there. But it was modest this quarter. Is there anything changing on that front?\nThomas Kunkel: This is Tom, Larry. So the nature of the PYD in Bond & Specialty is it that it can be a little lumpy. If you look at our Surety business over the years, you can see we've had some really good returns. And as our losses were continuing to come down, we, of course, tried to accurately account for that in our initial year loss PIKs. So that the majority of the results would hopefully be shown in that first calendar year. So I think what you've seen over time is an improved initial loss year PIK. And maybe less headroom in some of those areas for that stuff to move up. All that said, in our Management Liability businesses there's been a little bit of that too as we look to recognize things in that initial year as best we can. So I think, other than that no other great underlying dynamics that would explain that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Going back to the pricing dynamics within Business Insurance. Is there a difference between what you're seeing and what we call standard lines versus specialty?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, we're sort of looking at. Greg, you want to take that?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes. Meyers, are you referencing specialties like E&S?\nMeyer Shields: Yes.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes. I mean that depends so much on your product mix. I mean we're predominantly in the E&S business much more from a property perspective. So the answer would be yes, for us given some of the catastrophic pressures we've seen on property over the last two years.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And then more broadly I think this is mostly a question for Greg. We've seen in - at least the U.S. treasury, the pretty significant decline in interest rates from mid-November. How long does it take before that is reflected in pricing?\nDaniel Frey: Meyer, it's Dan. So we'll consider that in pricing as we do a number of factors. It's one of the hundred things that go into the process of determining what's the right price. We've seen the 10-year treasury move up and down, but it's been sort of plus or minus 0.3, not more than 0.2 or 0.3 per quarter over the last 4 or 5 quarters. So not a dramatic impact. It does eventually get baked into what we think we need for price to generate the returns that we're trying to generate because clearly, that's a component of return, but it hasn't had a dramatic impact at this point.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, also I'd add that - we bifurcated a little bit. We think about the return on the flow and that we adjust periodically to reflect market rates and then separately we think about the capital on the balance sheet that supports the risk and that, that really reflects the overall portfolio return.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.\nJoshua Shanker: I was reading outlook as everyone else was and I think it's not too different from what it said before. Despite the improvement you're getting on rates it's really the cessation of large losses and non-cat weather that will drive margin improvement for the remainder of the year. Am I reading that correctly?\nAlan Schnitzer: If you're looking at Business Insurance, yes, that's right. It's large losses returning to a more normal level.\nJoshua Shanker: And so can we say with the closed approximation that pricing and loss cost trend are in harmony right now, I guess, is your view?\nAlan Schnitzer: I would say that's about right on an earned basis. On a written basis, we're probably doing little bit better than that.\nJoshua Shanker: Okay. And just the same sort of reflections on the homeowner's business as well?\nMichael Klein: Yes, Josh, this is Michael. I would say on the homeowner's business, we're working to move RPC north. So we're not quite there on a written basis yet, but we're close.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research.\nAmit Kumar: I guess two quick follow-up questions. The first question goes back to the discussion on expense ratio. In your 10-Q letter, you talked about 40% of the business flowing through these business centers and BI. And I was curious if maybe you can talk about where does that sort of net out to? Is that an eventual improvement in expense ratio, or do the savings get reallocated somewhere else?\nAlan Schnitzer: Amit, thanks for that question. Productivity and efficiency is a strategic priority across the entire place in each of the businesses. In a claim ordination virtually everything we do. And so some of what Greg's achieving to the business centers contributes to that. It also contributes to other strategic objectives specifically making sure that we're providing good experiences for the brokers that we're doing business with and the customers that we're serving so it all goes to that point. The savings - whatever productivity and efficiency we generate there and frankly, anywhere else, really for us is, we look at operating leverage or enhanced operating leverage as an opportunity. And as we said before, we'll take those dollars and we'll reallocate them over time as we see fit. We can let it fall to the bottom line and you'll see the expense ratio. We can reinvest it in strategic initiatives that we think are going to drive shareholder value. Or if we want to or need to we can decide that we want to put into pricing without compromising our return objectives. So I know you've heard us say that a lot but what's important to us about enhanced operating leverage is having that flexibility.\nAmit Kumar: Now that you answered that question, the only other question I had is maybe for Michael, switching gears to personal auto. I know you answered several questions on what we saw on the loss cost trend. But can you sort of opine where do you see the trajectory from here on frequency and severity?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Amit. It is Michael. The short answer is when we look at our sort of long-term trend, in fact, it remains relatively consistent. And I would say talking about frequency and severity a little bit separately, generally what we see on the severity side is quarter-to-quarter fluctuations that sort of bounce around our long-term expectation. So again, we see the severity pressure that you see in industry statistics around parts and liability cost and those things. But feel like our long-term assessment on severity reflects those. On the frequency side, again, we talked about the first quarter underlying being driven by pricing earning in excess of trend inclusive of both sort of our assumption and a better-than-expected result in the quarter. And we do see for a number of quarters in a row now frequency coming in better than I think we or the industry had expected it, and it's something we're keeping an eye on and thinking about how to factor in.\nAmit Kumar: And is that - with the historical - frequency at a historical low, does that trend line continue or do you get a sense that probably this is as good as it gets?\nMichael Klein: I think it's a great question. I think if you take a longer-term look at frequency in auto, you see a bit of a secular decline and that's the piece that we're trying to figure out as we're returning to sort of that long-term downward trend in frequency or not. There's been a lot of commentary and discussion around - in the marketplace and in other places about what could be driving it and one of the things people point to is safety features on vehicles. I think it is important to point out that a number of the features that folks like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety point to as the ones that could have the most impact still have relatively low penetration in the fleet, right. Things like automatic emergency braking less than 5% of the cars on the road have it. So again, I think the journey is still out on whether there is a shift in long-term frequency trend but those are some of the things we're watching in addition to miles-driven employment and the other factors that we've talked about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.\nYaron Kinar: My first question, I think Elyse took a stab at it, is in Business Insurance. Can you talk about the impact from the nonweather large losses this quarter? How it compared to the prior year?\nAlan Schnitzer: Beyond - the international, is that what you're referring to Yaron?\nYaron Kinar: Well, I think last year, you just talked about large losses, nonweather losses, not necessarily referring to international.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, the large loss activity in domestic BI has been relatively flat, I would say.\nGregory Toczydlowski: I gave you in my comments here the non-cat weather was a little more than 0.5 point will be good guide relative to the first quarter of 2018.\nYaron Kinar: Right, right. I mean I think in 2018, you talk about roughly, 60 basis points of non-cat weather and another 60 basis points or so of other large, so it sounds like it couldn't really...\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, we're also slicing the bone probably a little bit - we're heading towards slicing the bone probably a little bit thinner than we'd like too. And I think most of the impact you're talking about was quarters two through four. And so my answer relatively flat was Q1 to Q1. But if you go back and look at your commentary from last quarter I think you'll hear us say that the improvement was primarily going to be in quarters two through four.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. That's helpful. And then Greg I think you'd said that in addition to pricing and also taking some terms and conditions, actions in large property. Can you give maybe a few examples of where the terms and conditions are improving or how they're improving?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Sure. Yes, coming off those two catastrophic years, there's obviously been some dislocation in the marketplace in just an opportunity for more risk sharing and that typically comes with terms and conditions. So you can think about sublimits on flood and earthquake, deductible shifting from a fixed component to more of the percentage certainly in the geographic exposed areas but that's something we're constantly looking at. With all that said, we look at our National Property business on account-by-account basis. So that's a generalization and we are, again, looking at each account and looking at the risk/reward of those accounts. And if there's an opportune time to have some risk-sharing like there is in the property segment right now then we go about and achieve that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Schmitt with William Blair.\nJeffrey Schmitt: Question about your Umbrella book. Heard in the market that there's an uptick in large losses there, mainly due to the litigation environment higher jury awards, higher settlement amounts. Is that something you're seeing at all?\nAlan Schnitzer: Let me - let's stay away from Umbrella. Let me just respond to social inflation more broadly. So I - this is probably an oversimplification. But I think, about social inflation probably in three buckets. I think about legal decisions, I think about plaintiff activity and I think about jury awards. From a legal decision's perspective, certainly, at the federal level, over the last couple of years, I'd say that's probably been on balance and improvement. If you look at jury awards, I would say a little bit more volatile, a little bit more unpredictable. And broadly speaking when it comes to plaintiff activity, the plaintiff's bar I would say we have seen a more aggressive plaintiff activity. Now that was certainly a big driver of the Commercial Auto charge that we took last quarter for example. We think about the liability side of C&P for example, but when you get into the larger end when you get into Umbrella when you think about the large end of GL, when you think about Management Liability, those are broadly speaking coverages where there's already a lot of litigation. Generally, everybody is represented in those cases and so those have always been reasonably active in terms of litigation. It's really at least so far on the smaller end where we've seen more activity.\nJeffrey Schmitt: Yes, and I guess, I was curious I mean it's been more acute obviously in Commercial Auto than other lines hearing they're starting to tick up in Umbrella. I guess, is that spreading or I mean it sounds like you're saying it's a little bit more broad-based already?\nAlan Schnitzer: No. I mean we're certainly seeing it. The phenomenon you're identifying could vary from company to company based on mix of business too, right. The net lines you put out, the types of risk. I mean you got to remember, we are - we're a Middle Market Main Street business for the most part. I mean obviously we do have a National Accounts business, a National Property business. And we do write public company liability on Management Liability side but, by and large, when you think about Travelers, it's a Main Street middle market business. So it could be a mixed difference for us relative to others.\nJeffrey Schmitt: And just one quick one on the homeowner's book looking at the underlying loss ratio up 100 basis points, half of that looks to be about related to the new cat treaty. But this remainder of 100 basis points after being up a lot last year, is this - is that pretty much all nonweather water losses that you're seeing? Can you speak to that more? Is that state-specific? Is this older homes? I mean, why is this popping up now for the industry?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Jeff. Just starting with the premise of the question I would say the treaty impacts a little more than you're estimating there and therefore, the other impacts are a little bit less in the underlying. But then underneath that we, again, as I mentioned we do continue to see some nonweather water loss pressure. And I would stay consistent with what we've talked about in the past we've sort of sliced and diced that by geography, by type of home, by age of home. We've looked at - we've seen commentary around the first floor, second floor, so we've looked at it by type of construction. And what we tend to see is these nonweather water losses are up sort of consistently across most of those dimensions. So there's not a thing we point to, which is why our strategy to address it has been to seek to increase price. So that be our view on the trend. But the underlying in the quarter does reflect some continued pressure there. Again, we expected some continued pressure there and have built a pricing strategy to address it. So that's our take on it.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters.\nAbbe Goldstein: Great.

And now, I would like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Before I address our fourth quarter and full year results a quick comment on current affairs. Yesterday, we witnessed the most American of events, the peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected administration to the next. It\u2019s not a political statement, but a patriotic one to say that we want to see this next administration succeed. We have significant challenges to overcome, a pandemic threatening the health and safety of our loved ones and neighbors, a distressed economy imperilling the lives and livelihoods of millions, and a deeply divided society, which undermines our collective sense of security and well-being. Let\u2019s hope yesterday marks the beginning of our political leaders on both sides of the aisle taking a constructive approach to addressing these challenges. And with that, I will turn to results. I am pleased to report a very strong finish to the year with fourth quarter core income of $1.3 billion or $4.91 per diluted share and core return on equity of 20.5%, each up meaningfully from the prior year quarter. We are also pleased to report full year core income of $2.7 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.3%, a substantial margin of the risk-free rate and our cost of equity. Our ability to deliver these results in the face of an historic pandemic, a record high number of PCS catastrophe events and record low interest rates is a testament to the strength of our franchise. More specifically, to our talented and committed workforce, the value of our hard to replicate competitive advantages and our expertise in balancing risk and reward to achieve industry-leading returns over time. The principal driver of the higher level of core income for the quarter was very strong underlying underwriting income, resulting from record net earned premium of $7.5 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 88.7%. We\u2019re pleased with the underwriting results in all three segments. We once again recorded a sub-30% consolidated expense ratio for the quarter and the full year, demonstrating that our strategic investments in improving productivity and efficiency continue to pay off. Turning to investments, this quarter, our high quality investment portfolio performed well, generating net investment income of $572 million after-tax as the non-fixed income portfolio continued to recover from the pandemic-related impacts earlier in the year. Our operating results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 7% during the year after returning $1.5 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including $672 million of share repurchases, which we resumed in the fourth quarter. Turning to production, notwithstanding the challenges in the economy, we continued to successfully execute on our marketplace strategies to generate growth in top line. Net written premiums in the quarter grew by 3%, driven by strong renewal rate change broadly across the book and continued strong retention in all three segments. Given the headwinds facing the industry, we expect the favorable pricing environment to continue for some time.  Business Insurance in our core middle-market business, renewal rate change was a record 9.1%, up 4.5 points over the prior year and about a point sequentially, while retention remained strong. Segmentation and pricing is key in this business. And to that end, the quality of the execution underneath the headline production numbers was excellent. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12% as renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business achieved a record 10.9%, driven by record renewal rate change, while retention remained strong. In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7% driven by strong renewal premium change in our agency homeowners business and strong retention and new business in both agency auto and agency homeowners. Fourth quarter production contributed to full year record net written premiums of almost $30 billion, up 2% compared to last year. Adjusting for the premium refund to be offered to our Personal Insurance auto customers, net written premiums were up 3%, a strong top-line result in the context of this year\u2019s difficult economic environment. Taking a step back, let me direct your attention to Slide 18 of the webcast presentation and put this year\u2019s results into a broader context. I\u2019ve shared before our belief that any commitment to delivering industry-leading return on equity over time requires a strategy to grow over time.  To that end, a few years ago, we laid out a strategy to achieve profitable growth in the context of the forces of change we have previously identified is impacting the industry. As you can see on the slide, despite the challenging economic and operating environment, 2020 was another successful year of the execution of that strategy. Since 2016, we have grown net written premiums at a 4.5% compound annual rate, substantially outpacing both GDP growth over the same period and rate over the prior years in the decade. We accomplished that while maintaining a stable underlying underwriting margin. In other words, we haven\u2019t grown by under-pricing the product or changing our risk profile. The growth has come organically from customer segments, products, geographies and producers that we know well. Over that same period through our ongoing and relentless focus on optimizing productivity and efficiency, we\u2019ve also improved our expense ratio by about two points compared to the run rate from earlier in the decade. As you can also see on the slide, the result of all that is significantly higher underlying underwriting income, meaningfully higher cash flow from operations and double-digit growth in invested assets. Those results have contributed to our ultimate objective of creating shareholder value and industry leading return on equity over time. Our core return on equity has increased in each of the last three years and averaged 11% over that period. And that 11% is after bearing the impacts of significant cat and non-cat weather activity and meaningful increase in social inflation, historically low interest rates and the global pandemic. In short, our performance this year and over recent years is the result of a sound strategy and the successful achievement of our strategic objectives. Looking forward from here, thanks to our team, our strategy, our capabilities and our strong track record of innovation and execution, we feel very well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead as the economy continues to recover and beyond. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I want to acknowledge and thank my 30,000 colleagues, many of whom are listening this morning, for their tireless efforts over this past year. Notwithstanding concerns for their own safety and responsibilities for taking care of loved ones and educating their children, they never wavered from our purpose of taking care of the people with privilege to serve or our mission of creating shareholder value.  I couldn\u2019t be more proud of this team. I also want to acknowledge and thank all those who have been involved in the extraordinary effort of developing and manufacturing COVID vaccines in record time. From the scientists to the regulators to those who volunteer to participate in trials, it\u2019s a remarkable feat. The sight of those vaccines rolling off the line inspires optimism for the coming year and the sheer human will and ingenuity behind the effort inspire hope for the future. And with that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.262 billion, up from $867 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 20.5%, up from 14.8%. Improvement in both measures was the result of very strong underlying underwriting results. Our fourth quarter results include $29 million of pre-tax cat losses compared to $85 million of pre-tax cat losses in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.  Recall that last year\u2019s fourth quarter cat losses included a $101 million benefit from recoveries under the underlying Aggregate Cat Treaty, whereas in 2020, we exhausted the Cat Treaty in the third quarter. So, there were no recoveries under the treaty in this year\u2019s fourth quarter. This quarter\u2019s cat results include about $40 million of favorable development in our loss estimates for events that occurred earlier in the year.  PYD in the current quarter, for which I will provide more details shortly, was net favorable $180 million pre-tax. The underlying combined ratio of 88.7% which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD improved by 3.4 points from the prior year quarter. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $804 million increased by nearly 50% over the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher levels of earned premium and higher margins, driven by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend and continued favorability in personal auto loss experience. For the quarter, losses directly related to COVID-19, totaled a modest $31 million pre-tax, split about evenly between Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. More than offsetting those losses were lower levels of auto claims in both Personal Insurance and Business Insurance. The net impact of the COVID environment on the consolidated underlying combined ratio amounted to a benefit of about 2.5 points, mostly in Personal Insurance. We continue to take a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of COVID-related losses given the ongoing uncertainty in this environment. As has been the case throughout the year, the majority of direct COVID losses that we have booked through year end, remains in IBNR. Looking at the full year net impact of COVID costs and benefits, including the impact of premium refunds to policyholders, our consolidated underlying combined ratio benefited by about a point. The fourth quarter expense ratio of 29.4% brings the full year expense ratio to 29.9%. While throughout the year we continued to make the investments necessary to fuel our continued success, our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency once again resulted in a sub-30% expense ratio despite the downward pressure on earned premiums from the impact of the soft economy on insured exposures and the premium refunds we issued to our personal auto customers. We continue to be comfortable with the consolidated expense ratio of around 30%. After-tax net investment income improved by 9% from the prior year quarter to $572 million, as strong returns in the fixed income portfolio and a higher level of invested assets were partially offset by the expected decline in fixed income yields. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter as we project that the benefit of higher average levels of invested assets will be more than offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio in the lower interest rate environment. Turning to reserves, net favorable prior year reserve development occurred in all three segments and totaled $180 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $124 million was driven by better than expected loss experience in workers\u2019 comp, primarily from accident years 2017 and prior, partially offset by an increase to reserves related to very old years in our runoff book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $32 million resulted primarily from better than expected loss development in the surety book. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable PYD of $24 million was driven by the automobile line. With our combined 2020 Schedule P is filed earlier in the second quarter, the line of business analysis will provide more detail on the loss trends we have noted in our commentary throughout the year with favorability in workers\u2019 comp, commercial property and the personal lines coverages and some strengthening in the commercial liability lines, much of which was in very old accident years relating to our run-off book. Page 19 of the earnings presentation provides information about our January 1 Cat Treaty renewals. Our longstanding Corporate Cat XOL Treaty renewed on terms in line with the expiring treaty and continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events. Regarding the underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty we first purchased for 2019, we have renewed the treaty again for 2021. While the treaty will continue to address qualifying PCS-designated events in North America for which we incurred losses of $5 million or more, the 2021 renewal includes a $5 million deductible per event. In prior years, PCS-designated events had cost us more than $5 million accounted towards the treaty from $1. Treaty provides aggregate coverage of $350 million, part of $500 million of losses, above our aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. The aggregate retention for 2021 increased from 2020\u2019s $1.55 billion, largely reflecting recent years\u2019 experience and anticipated growth in our property book. Hurricane and earthquake events once again have $250 million per occurrence cap. And for 2021, wildfires are also capped at $250 million per event. Incorporating our assumptions about cat and non-cat weather for 2021, we expect the full year impact of the treaty on our underlying combined ratio to be roughly half a point. And we anticipate only a minimal impact on the total combined ratio. Both of those impacts are consistent with the assumptions we had in each of the past two years. Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.9 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. For the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $6 billion for the first time ever and reflected the benefit of continued increases in premium volume subrogation recoveries from PG&E related to the 2017 and 2018 California wildfires and lower overall claim payouts as court room and other settlement activity slowed throughout the year due to COVID-related shutdowns. Higher levels of cash flow give us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio. Interest yields decreased modestly as credit spreads tightened during the fourth quarter. And accordingly, our net unrealized investment gains increased from $3.8 billion after-tax as of September 30 to $4.1 billion after-tax at year end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses was $99.54 at year end, a 7% increase from a year ago. We returned $419 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $218 million and share repurchases of $201 million. For the year, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, on a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 20 of the webcast presentation. As we entered 2021, we again thought it would be helpful to highlight the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decades. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. Cat losses in the second quarter have been about twice as much as any other quarter on average. And the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in seven of the past 10 years. To wrap it up, we are very pleased with the quarter and full year results, especially given the challenging circumstances. And now, I will turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. For the fourth quarter, Business Insurance produced $713 million of segment income, an increase of almost 60% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Higher net favorable prior year reserve development, underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower cat losses, all contributed to the favorable year-over-year increase. We are pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.6%, which improved by 2.8 points from the prior year quarter. We benefited again from earned pricing that exceeded loss trend with an impact this quarter of a little more than a point and a half. There is also a point and a half of improvement due to the favorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2019, which was elevated due to the re-estimation of losses for prior quarters. Turning to the top line, in light of the ongoing macroeconomic challenges, we remain pleased with the resilience of our business. Net written premiums were only slightly lower than the prior year quarter with strong rate and high retentions mostly offsetting modestly lower levels of insured exposures as well as lower new business. The lower insured exposures reflect lower levels of economic activity as well as impacts from our active management of terms and conditions and deal structures, including deductibles, attachment points and limits. Turning to domestic production, we achieved a record renewal rate change of 8.4%, up almost 4 points from the fourth quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 83%. This quarter marks the eighth consecutive quarter and with renewal rate change was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. We continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines other than workers\u2019 compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the prior year. Importantly, we continue to feel great about our deliberate and granular execution in terms of rate and retention on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis. The segmentation beneath the headline numbers was once again excellent. Also, one other thing that\u2019s not apparent in the headline numbers is the contribution to margins from the active management terms, conditions and deal structure that I mentioned a minute ago. We are doing this broadly across the book, but most notably, in our National Property business. The tighter terms tend to persist beyond the rate cycle. New business of $440 million was down $35 million from the prior year quarter. Given the lower levels of economic activity and given the hardening market conditions, there is a higher proportion of distressed business in the market. Our new business production reflects our disciplined approach to that business. Risk selection is particularly important during circumstances like these. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change increased to 4.2%, up more than 2 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and more than one point from the third quarter of this year. Retention of 77% was down from recent periods, a result of deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of the business. As I mentioned above, we\u2019re pleased with the segmented execution underneath the aggregate result. Importantly, we have not slowed down on our commitment to invest in product development and ease of doing business, which position us well for long-term profitable growth in this business. In middle-market, renewal rate change increased to 9.1%, while retention remained at 86%. Renewal rate change was up 4.5 points from the fourth quarter of 2019 and almost a point from the third quarter of this year. Additionally, we achieved positive rate on more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a more than 10 point increase from the fourth quarter of last year. To sum up, we feel terrific about our results and execution, especially given some of the unusual economic challenges related to the pandemic. We continue to improve the profitability of the book, while investing strategically for the future. These investments include enhancing the experiences for our customers and distribution partners, developing new insights for our underwriters, digitizing the underwriting transaction and creating efficiencies. Examples of capabilities released this year include, rollout of our completely redesigned BOP 2.0, small commercial product which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast easy quoting experience. This new product is now available in 23 states and performing consistently with our expectations. Advancement of our industry-leading strategic work intake initiatives which allow for automated receipt of submissions from the various technology solutions our agent partners use and the seamless routing of those submissions which improves the experience for our distribution partners and is more efficient for us enhancing our MyTravelers customer self-service application. And lastly, our Simply Business and Zensurance platforms continue to advance their digital capabilities and offerings in the alternative platform space. We\u2019re as confident as ever that strategic investments like these together with our meaningful competitive advantages position us well for long-term profitable growth. Concluding, I would like to acknowledge and thank our employees, agents and brokers for their partnership as we seamlessly delivered virtual solutions for the benefit of our combined customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered strong returns and double-digit growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $164 million, nearly flat with the prior year quarter as the benefit of higher business volumes and a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development were offset by an underlying combined ratio, which while still strong at 85%, was higher than the prior year quarter, the underlying combined ratio of 3.7 points driven by the impact of higher loss estimates for management liability coverages, primarily losses attributable to COVID-19 related economic conditions. As we discussed last quarter, the products that we write in this segment are susceptible to elevated loss levels in times of severe economic downturn. We experienced that during the financial crisis, and again, in recent quarters due to the impacts of the pandemic. Nonetheless, with the strong rate levels we\u2019re achieving, we expect that the underlying combined ratio in 2021 will improve a little bit from the roughly 87% in the second half of 2020. Turning to top line, net written premiums grew an outstanding 12% in the quarter, reflecting continued improved pricing in our management liability business with nearly flat Surety production despite the continued economic impact of COVID-19 on public project procurement and related bond demand. In our domestic management liability business, we\u2019re pleased that renewal premium change increased to a record 10.9%, driven by record high renewal rate change, while retention of 89% remained near historical highs. These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy to pursue rate in light of elevated loss activity, while maintaining strong retention levels in our high quality portfolio. We will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted. Domestic management liability new business for the quarter increased $13 million, primarily reflecting our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Consistent with last quarter, submissions are up, while quote activity is down. So, Bond & Specialty results were again strong despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19. Beyond the numbers, notwithstanding our focus on managing through the challenging environment, we continued to invest in differentiating our businesses in the eyes of our customers and agents and broker partners, while positioning ourselves for continued profitability and competitiveness in the future. Some highlights from 2020 include, continuing investments in our surety business to help our contractor clients more effectively manage risk, while providing insights that will enable them to more profitably manage their business, piloting digital platforms that will improve the speed and convenience of accessing management liability and small surety products for our agents and brokers and investing in a new sales management platform that will enhance productivity, optimize workflow management and increase sales. Lastly, I\u2019d like to thank our employees and distribution partners for their commitment to creatively and effectively addressing the needs of our customers in these most unusual times. And now, I will turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Tom and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter, segment income increased to $457 million and our combined ratio improved to 84.1%. Full year\u2019s segment income was $1.2 billion and the combined ratio was 89.7%. The significant improvement for both periods compared to the prior year is primarily driven by lower frequency of automobile losses as well as the benefit to underwriting income from higher business volumes. In addition, the full year results include higher net favorable prior year reserve development and elevated catastrophe losses. Net written premium growth for the fourth quarter and full year was 7% and 5% respectively with continued strong retention and higher levels of new business, resulting in record net written premiums of more than $11.3 billion for the year. Agency Automobile profitability was very strong with a combined ratio of 86.5% for the fourth quarter. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved 12 points, continuing to reflect favorable frequency levels. Approximately one-third of the improvement in the quarter is from favorable reestimates of activity for prior quarters in 2020. We continue to observe lower claim frequency as a result of fewer miles driven, reflecting the ongoing impact from the pandemic. We will continue to analyze and incorporate current trends into our state-specific underwriting and pricing decisions as we balance business volumes and profitability. In Agency Homeowners & Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 81.9% increased relative to the prior year quarter, driven by a higher underlying combined ratio and an increase in catastrophe losses. The fourth quarter included one catastrophe, Hurricane Zeta, with no recoveries from the Catastrophe Aggregate Reinsurance Treaty. The underlying combined ratio of 78.5% was 5 points higher than the prior year quarter due to higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, and to a lesser degree, increases in other losses, specifically elevated fire losses. The full year combined ratio of 93% was comparable to the prior year with increased favorable prior year reserve development and improved underlying results, offset by elevated catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.9% was almost 3 points better than last year, driven by lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. This improvement demonstrates the success of our continuing efforts to improve returns in property, while growing the business. Turning to quarterly production, overall results were again very strong. We are pleased with our momentum in Agency Automobile. Retention was 84% and new business increased 12%, contributing to the 3% year-over-year growth in policies in force. Renewal premium changes were lower given our pricing actions in response to the favorable loss environment. We continue to see growth in this profitable line. Agency homeowners and other delivered another excellent quarter with retention of 85% and a 21% increase in new business, while renewal premium change again exceeded 8%. Policies in force were up 8% from a year ago. These results reflect our continued efforts to grow, while improving profitability. Looking back, 2020 was both a challenging and successful year for Personal Insurance. We achieved record levels of segment income, net written premium and policies in force. Our continued success reflects the execution of our strategy to meet customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want. Examples include, nearing completion of our Quantum Home 2.0 rollout, which is now available in over 40 states, increasing the take-up of IntelliDrive by enhancing our auto telematics offering in 17 states. And just this week, we introduced IntelliDrive in Canada as well, improving our customer self-service capabilities with our new MyT mobile app, which will be rolled out more broadly throughout the first quarter of 2021. Planting an additional 500,000 trees for customer enrollment in paperless billing, bringing the total number of trees planted through our partnership with American Forest to 1.5 million. And just recently, announcing the acquisition of InsuraMatch, an innovative digital online platform that allows customers to compare offerings for more than 40 carriers across the United States, we expect to complete the acquisition in the first quarter of 2021 subject to customary closing conditions. Before I wrap up, I would like to add my thanks to our team and our distribution partners for continuing to deliver value to our customers despite a challenging and uncertain environment. We have strong momentum going into 2021 and are well positioned to deliver profitable growth, while investing in capabilities that will continue to enhance the value of our franchise. Now, I will turn the call back over to Abbe.\nTom Kunkel: Michael, this is Tom Kunkel. I just want to jump in quickly and mention that I did misspeak when I was discussing management liability new business. I believe I said it increased by $13 million and it actually decreased by $13 million.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Tom. Thank you. And operator, we are now ready to turn to questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Yes, hi, everybody. Can you hear me?\nAlan Schnitzer: We can. Good morning.\nMichael Phillips: Good morning. Thanks. I have had a choppy connection. So I apologize if you couldn\u2019t hear me. Congrats on the quarter. I guess I will start on Business Insurance, we are seeing nice, nice improvement still in the core margins, a bit of a slowdown, I guess in the renewal rate change, still strong, it\u2019s your highest you said in quite a while, but a bit of a slowdown from prior quarter. I guess any reason to think and I think Alan, you said again, I am sorry, I was a bit choppy. I think you said you expect rates to continue to move up if I heard you correctly. I guess given the margin improvement and what I have seen is a bit of a slowdown in the renewal rate change, is there any reason to not think we are close if not already at a peak in pricing for Business Insurance?\nAlan Schnitzer: Michael, we are at record levels and we are compounding on compounding, so it\u2019s hard to look at this execution and find any negative in that. And from here, the outlook is positive also on the historical numbers the segmentation is really important and I think the point Greg made in his prepared remarks up about the benefit of the tightening terms and conditions and other numbers, so all that\u2019s really important. And from here, I think this plays out for a while and it\u2019s a function of rate adequacy. All the drivers are environmental. So, primarily loss activity think about social inflation, think about weathers, think about wildfires, if you got the interest rates that appear to be lower for longer costs and availability of reinsurance, pandemic losses impacting the industry and I suspect for some markets, maybe so reckoning with social inflation. So, I expect that as the favorable rate environment to continue and to persist at levels that will result in expanding margins for a while.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thank you very much for that. And then second question I guess, Greg, you mentioned I apologize also a little bit choppy, but you mentioned comp and pricing there on comp what we are hearing from external sources and a lot of the market\u2019s results that it\u2019s bit of a inflection in comp pricing and not much, but a bit of a turn at least. I guess, what are you seeing in comp? Your PYD there was strong. Loss trend seems to be pretty favorable there. So maybe comment on if you are seeing a bit of a turn in pricing and comp kind of what\u2019s driving that and should we expect that to last given the lowest transits you would be pretty favorable there as well? Thanks.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes. Good morning, Michael. This is Greg. Yes, we continue to think we are at or near a bottom in workers\u2019 comp and the evidence that we will get as the bureau loss cost recommendations and our own rate structure. And so yes, we continue to believe that and I\u2019ll just remind you that we are an account solution and we feel terrific about our entire book of business. Workers\u2019 comp is usually just one of the many solutions that we are offering our customers, but yes, we continue to believe we are at or near the bottom.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, great. Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just a question for Alan, I guess I haven\u2019t seen the 4Q numbers, but through the third quarter, you had really substantial increases in IBNR and economically exposed lines, like commercial auto and GL. So obviously, reported claims have been slow to come in relative to your picks. I guess I am curious what you are learning as courts reopen and things like that. Is that starting \u2013 is that still starting to look conservative or are you seeing a higher pace of reported claims that would support those initial loss estimates?\nAlan Schnitzer: You are right, I think the best way I can explain it is obviously going back a few years, we saw some elevated loss activity. We responded to that over a couple of quarters. And I would say that more recently, we have been sticking to that higher level. And what we are seeing in the data frankly might be a little bit favorable to what we would have expected, but we are not responding to that, because you think there is some disruption in the data and so for now we are going to stick with our view of the longer term trends. Is that responsive?\nRyan Tunis: Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess for Greg, just looking at the growth in Business Insurance similar to last quarter, but look like some of the KPIs look better exposure was a little bit better sequentially and even new business wasn\u2019t down quite as much. It looked like a lot of that was workers\u2019 comp. I am just trying to think about how are we trending into 2021 based on what you are seeing relative to the negative 3% that we posted during the fourth quarter?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, as you said, Ryan, we have seen improvement with exposure. As the economy starts picking up we have shared with you for some time now that we do believe we are highly correlated with the overall GDP in terms of the GL workers\u2019 comp, the ratable products that follow payrolls and sales receipts of that sort. And so as that starts picking up, we we believe we will see some as we are starting to see in our book already, some improvements in our production, specifically through the exposure metric.\nAlan Schnitzer: I will just add to that, Ryan that our book is \u2013 Greg\u2019s point is exactly right. There is a correlation there. But I just think given the high quality of accounts and business that we write we have actually done a little bit better than even we might have thought related to relevant \u2013 relative to economic activity.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Dolin-Benguigui with Barclays Research. Your line is open.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Thank you. Good morning. In the tort liability arms race who is ahead, pricing or loss trend, I guess I\u2019m mindful that the economic slowdown just means less court activity?\nDan Frey: Tracy, it\u2019s Dan. You broke up a little bit at the beginning of the question. Do you mind repeating it?\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Absolutely. Apologize for that. I am just thinking about the tort liability arms race. We think about it in a race who maybe ahead pricing or loss trend. I guess I\u2019m mindful that given the economic slowdown, there is less court activity?\nDan Frey: Yes. So, I remember Tracy, when we talked about loss trend in BI that\u2019s all in and that\u2019s including our more recent views over the last couple of years of elevated loss environment for things like social inflation. And so when we are looking at \u2013 and now earned rate numbers that are coming through Business Insurance, that\u2019s clearly ahead of loss trend. I think to your second point, where we are looking at the data as it comes in now and not assuming that that\u2019s the new normal, we are assuming that what we are seeing is slower levels of claim payments that won\u2019t necessarily ultimately be lower levels of claim payments. So we have stuck with our more normal long-term view that we think those lost costs are higher, but having said that, where rates are now we think rates ahead of lost trends.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Okay, excellent. And then from my follow-up Greg was talking about improvement in terms and conditions, I am wondering if you could just unpack that maybe give an example like I have heard on the reinsurance side, they have been a little bit tighter on silent cyber. And I don\u2019t know if Tom had any views for our management liability?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, sure, Tracy. Just to give you a sense, you have two different dynamics between the property and the casualty wise. Property, you have a lot more opportunity on terms and conditions, I think deductibles insured the value margin clause language changes that help improve the margins for us and provide some coinsurance back to the customer. In terms of \u2013 I reference the term deal structure you can think of that more on the casualty side. And so umbrella, attachment points are increasing in women\u2019s management making sure that we are putting very thoughtful capacity around the limits that we offer. So, that\u2019s some of the activity that we are doing across the portfolio.\nAlan Schnitzer: And Tracy, just to \u2013 in BI, just to give you a specific example, because you asked for that, we do think about we do add, for example, communicable disease exclusions in, you know, industries and segments and customers where we think that\u2019s important to do so, Tom?\nTom Kunkel: And the way it looks really in the management liability businesses is the focus has been largely on pricing, but certainly a lot of work on deductible, self-insured retentions and limits coming down in a number of cases. And if we are really going to see a change of policy terms in the near future, cyber would certainly be the most likely place where that would occur in the short-term.\nTracy Dolin-Benguigui: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question was on the Business Insurance margin, you guys said as we have 150 basis points on just a rate exceeding trend in the quarter. Was there anything else like one offset to that within the margin? And then could you give us a sense of the net, sorry if I missed it, the net COVID benefit, including the frequency impact within BI in the quarter?\nDan Frey: Yes, Elyse, it\u2019s Dan. I will take that. So, price versus trend, I think Greg\u2019s comments was a little more than a 1.5 point, so think about that as being between a 1.5 and 2 points. The other thing that Greg called out, which we would say in terms of the comparison might be a little unusual remember, in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we told you we took about a 1.5 point of sort of prior quarter catch up as we adjusted our view of the liability loss ratios last year. So that impacted the year-over-year comparison as well. To the COVID question, very modest as it was last quarter, so not really big enough to mention a small favorable, but think about that in the 10s of points, which is why it didn\u2019t get attention in the scripts.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my second question is on the expense ratio side, I think last quarter you guys have pointed to kind of seeing like around 30s like a good run-rate. But you continue to come in better than that and especially within Business Insurance and expense ratio continued to improve this quarter like it did last quarter. Is there something related to COVID expenses or as kind of expense ratio bogey was down a little bit when we think about where you guys could come in on a go forward basis?\nDan Frey: Yes, Elyse, COVID has had some pluses and minuses on the expense side. On the one hand, there have been some higher provisions for things like bad debt, but there have been savings in things like travel and expenses. When you step back and look at the full year and on a consolidated basis, I am not at all surprised where we were I think coming out of last year, we said we would be happy with something around the 30, the full year this is at 29.9, I said again, in my comments, we are probably pretty comfortable at this level. So, I think we have settled and we are probably going to say on what we are thinking about expense ratio.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you for the color.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So, I had a question first on just your views on business interruption exposure and it seems like it is sort of trending in the favor of the insurance industry so far at least in the U.S., but what your view is in terms of your exposure and whether the FCA decision makes you reassess your exposure in Europe?\nAlan Schnitzer: Good morning. Our view on business interruption exposure for us remains unchanged. There is nothing in that FCA decision in Europe that causes to think any differently about our exposure or the reserves that we\u2019ve put up for it. More recently, there was a decision earlier this week in Ohio related to another insurance company that was adverse to that company. And generally speaking, we prefer not to comment on pending litigation whether it\u2019s ours or anyone else\u2019s, but since you asked a question, I would just point out that our standard policy language is different from the language issue in that case in some very key respects. And so in Ohio and elsewhere, we remain very confident in our policy language and feel no differently about our business interruption exposure. And I guess I would just caution everybody to keep in mind that over the last few months and across the country, the vast majority of these cases have been in the favor of insurers.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then secondly just what are your views on pricing in commercial auto, obviously, recently, litigation activities declined a lot, but do you think prices have caught up to lost costs, it\u2019s sort of social inflation litigation go back once the virus sort of abates?\nAlan Schnitzer: Jimmy, there is just not much more competitively sensitive than our pricing strategy. So, I think we are going to probably stay away from where pricing is going by line. But I will just reiterate what we said before, which is we think this is a favorable pricing environment that that\u2019s going to play out for a while and it\u2019s a function of rate adequacy and there still is a rate need in commercial auto. So, to one degree or another, we will continue to I think benefit from the rate environment in commercial auto.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay, thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. Thanks. First question, I am thinking about top line versus kind of buybacks. I recall a number of pre-COVID, you guys kind of talked about given top line was picking up just you wanted to make sure we understood that buyback levels might not resume at the same ratios as in the past. Kind of trying to think through the dynamics going forward, earnings are healthy and improving, but the top line is still, the outlook, I am not going to put words in your mouth, that seems maybe still to be a little weak due to the economy. So, should we be thinking that there might be more room for buybacks in the near-term?\nDan Frey: Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Dan. I think just thinking about the right dynamics, I don\u2019t know that this necessarily leads you to conclusion about what we are going to do in the near-term. And again, we are going to think about this over a longer period of time, to the degree that, as Alan commented, we have experienced and been able to generate more top line growth in recent years than we had historically, the current COVID environment sort of notwithstanding, that\u2019s something that we look to do on a go forward basis. And even this year plus 3%, when you adjust for the personal insurance auto refunds that we made, the comments that we made a year or so ago would still hold true, I think to the degree that the top line grows, that\u2019s going to require us to hold more capital, because everything that requires capital grows with it, reserve balances grow, your investment portfolio grows. And the only point we were really trying to make when we made those comments a year or so ago was don\u2019t think about us perpetually being able to return 100% of earnings in the form of dividends and buybacks. We are going to have to hold some of that for growth. So that would still be true, the amount by which we would have had to increase capital this year might be slightly less than we would have expected coming into the year, because COVID had a little bit of a dampening effect on the top line, but directionally all those same things would still hold true.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, understood. That\u2019s helpful. And lastly, shifting to workers\u2019 comp specifically, I guess, some firms have talked about and it sounds like you guys too are \u2013 talked about less claim frequencies during the pandemic, but still kind of holding you said to like broadly in the BI segment kind of still holding your picks conservatively. Historically, have you seen kind of a -- more of a catch up or later claims filings in workers\u2019 comp, maybe after previous recessionary periods? Is that dynamic you guys are contemplating?\nDan Frey: Yes. Let me just give you a little bit of color on how we see or thinking about the workers\u2019 comp loss activity. So, first of all, the, the COVID related claim rate is relatively low relative to the infection rate and lower than we might have expected. And the severity on COVID related workers\u2019 comp is also coming in a little better than we had thought. There is \u2013 there continues to be some benefit from non-COVID related frequency as people are working from home, but there still is in our minds a degree of uncertainty to your point about how COVID related workers\u2019 comp claims are going to play out over time. So we have been pretty cautious in the way that we have been looking for workers\u2019 comp losses to make sure that we don\u2019t get surprised by that.  Now, historically, putting COVID aside historically, in a recession, you get sort of offsetting forces in workers\u2019 comp, you got people who want to stay on the job. So, they are less inclined to go out and so frequency is down a little bit. But severity goes up a little bit, because once people go out, they tend to stay out longer on workers\u2019 comp, but historically for us in recessionary periods, the net of those two things have been a little bit of a positive. You mean every circumstance is different and so hard to know for sure, but that\u2019s generally what we have seen in the past. And so, I think that\u2019s sort of the landscape as we see it on workers\u2019 comp loss activity.\nMike Zaremski: And Alan that will follow-up to a follow-up with just you, I was kind of trying to allude to okay, I figure out post-recession, did you see a kind of a jump or any kind of spike in frequency? I appreciate the comments about during the recession there was a net benefit, just curious if there was kind of a catch up sort of a post-recession?\nAlan Schnitzer: I just don\u2019t have that data in front of me from prior recessions. And so I am a little hesitant to shoot from the hip. I am just not sure. I mean, as we are looking around the room at each other, I don\u2019t think there is anything that we think would be all that particularly significant, but again, I just don\u2019t have the data in front of me to be responsive to that.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: David Motemaden with Evercore, your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess just another question on the Business Insurance underlying loss ratio and that\u2019s 150 basis points of core improvement now in 4Q that\u2019s improved, I think last quarter, you said it improved 100 basis points year-over-year. I guess as we think about obviously rate earning in above the 5% loss trend. Is there any reason to think that, that shouldn\u2019t continue to accelerate as we head into 2021?\nDan Frey: Hey, it\u2019s Dan. All else being equal, no, you have seen mathematically, I think what you have seen in the last couple of quarters is what you would have expected to see based on the comments that we started making a year ago when we felt that we were reaching the point where rate was reaching or exceeding loss trend and then that would start to come through on an earned basis to the extent that written pricing has continued to increase. We would expect the earned impact of that to continue to increase on a lagging basis. Again, all else being equal and rarely is all else equal but looking at those two things, yes.\nDavid Motemaden: Right. Okay, thanks. I appreciate that, Dan. And I guess Greg just a question on exposure growth and specifically, you had mentioned the dampening impact of terms and conditions and then the impact that, that had on exposure growth. I guess maybe, is there any way to quantify that? And maybe as we think about heading into 2021, any sort of view in terms of how this may impact terms and conditions may dampen exposure growth as we enter into 2021?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey, David. It\u2019s Greg. Yes, that\u2019s just competitively sensitive. So, we give you exposure overall, we give you rate, we give you our PC, but we really don\u2019t breakdown exposure in terms of the insured exposure versus deal structure and terms and conditions. So that\u2019s just something we don\u2019t provide.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thank you.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Hey, thanks. The first one, Greg, just on the Select business, if I take a look at the retention rates dropped pretty meaningfully from the second quarter. I guess my question there is that due to just the economy and the impact that\u2019s having on small businesses or is it that you are kind of pushing rate terms and conditions here and that\u2019s having an effect on your retentions and at what point do you need to layoff maybe a little bit to kind of get that retention ratio back up?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, good morning, Brian. Yes, it really is a combination of both our profit improvement initiatives, which isn\u2019t just for Select, as we have been sharing, that\u2019s across the entire BI portfolio. But when we look at the uptick in rate and the offset in retention, our product managers and underwriters can see the variance of the loss ratios versus what we retained and what we \u2013 what lapse that we feel very comfortable with the tradeoff between those two. So we are going to continue to improve the margins on that Select business. And then in terms of your comment on the pandemic, we have certainly seen since the pandemic, the Select business has felt the flow, the most reduction with the pandemic on smaller businesses. And so new business has absolutely felt that, but we feel great about the quality of the new business that we are writing in the Select business right now.\nAlan Schnitzer: And if I just\u2026\nBrian Meredith: That could affect your retention too, couldn\u2019t it?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Sure. You sure could, yes.\nAlan Schnitzer: Brian, just to put a finer point on Greg\u2019s comment which I agree with, we have been at these types of retention levels before in Select. So, this isn\u2019t an unusual place for us to be and I guess you are all looking at headline numbers we are looking at a very granular set of data underneath that shows us exactly what the execution is in terms of rate retention loss ratios. So, we feel very, very good about this execution.\nBrian Meredith: Great. And then my follow-up here, Alan, how are you all thinking about potential liability exposures to back to work plans as eventually the economy reopens? And do you have protections in some of your policies to maybe mitigate some of that exposure and what are your thoughts on that?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, it\u2019s a great question. I am glad you asked. We would have hoped that there would have been some federal liability protection, I just think given the way things have played out that\u2019s probably less likely to happen. But there are a couple of things that still help one, there have been a number of states, I think more than 30 states that in one form or another have taken some kind of action to provide some COVID liability protection. At the federal level, we have got a more right leaning bench today than we did 4 years ago, certainly. So, that helps a little bit. And then we can address it through things like rate and risk control and risk selection. And as I mentioned before, in some industry classes, we have started to put in communicable disease exclusions where we think that could be important. So we are \u2013 it\u2019s an exposure, it\u2019s out there. I think it\u2019s unfortunate, because I think it\u2019s the plaintiff\u2019s bar that benefits at the expense of economic recovery, but we will manage to it just fine.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you. I wanted to [Technical Difficulty]\nAlan Schnitzer: Hey, Josh. We can\u2019t hear you at all.\nJosh Shanker: Okay. [Technical Difficulty]\nAlan Schnitzer: Hey, Josh, are you there? Why don\u2019t we take the next caller \u2013 Josh, yes, go ahead.\nJosh Shanker: Sorry about that. I guess those headphones don\u2019t work that I was trying to use, okay, the $0.50 solution. Anyway, I was an area that we doesn\u2019t really get enough attention to national accounts, because we all talk about Business Insurance ex-national accounts. Can we talk about the \u2013 what is the trend there in terms of premium? How much of the falloff in that area do you think is temporary how much comes back? What\u2019s the distribution of that business in terms of premium volume to think about as we get to the end of COVID, I guess?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey, Josh. This is Greg. Yes, national accounts was down 5% for the year and that\u2019s a business where a couple of large accounts can make up a quarter or a year and that was the case for us in 2020 where we just had more loss larger accounts than new and we felt that on the top line. Now, as you said, that it\u2019s an important part of our portfolio where we are encouraged around the national accounts. And we have recently re-launched a service entry for claims service and we continue to invest in it and it\u2019s an important part of our portfolio.\nJosh Shanker: And to the extent in terms of the accounting for that, I think there is a lot of audit accounting. Are we still in the audit accounting phase for that and now we are earning through and as the economy picks up, we will see audit accounting go the other direction, how should we expect that to trend?\nDan Frey: Josh, it\u2019s Dan, I am not quite sure I understand your question, but to the degree that, a lot of our Business Insurance accounts are subject to audit, including some business and national accounts. Generally speaking, in this year, we have seen a lower level of audit premium additions not surprisingly given the lower level of overall economic activity. I don\u2019t have the data in front of me I don\u2019t know that we have heard anything that\u2019s particularly different in the national accounts front than say in middle market. So I think broadly speaking, we have seen audit premium activity behave probably not surprisingly in response to what you are seeing in the more general economy.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, I guess I will stop, but are we more or less through that audit account period by 4Q or it was a bigger issue in 2Q and 3Q and now the sort of premium submissions are in line with the exposures or are we still at a period of time where we are seeing that headwind comes through on your premium numbers due to weaker audit accounts?\nDan Frey: Yes. And I would be careful about thinking headwind in terms of year-over-year there is less audit premium than there was last year. We haven\u2019t yet reached the point where in aggregate audit premiums have turned negative, they are just lower, positive. So, it impacts the growth rate year-over-year. And to your point, it will continue for a while because in many cases, you are doing audits, 15 months after the policy terms were set in the first place. And so there is still a while to work through the COVID impact on policies that haven\u2019t yet reached that maturity level.\nJosh Shanker: Alright. Well, thank you. I probably have some more questions, but I\u2019ll take them offline. Thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks. So, one quick question on personal insurance and then a follow-up on Business Insurance, Michael, are you pricing auto for normalized driving or are you trying to adjust pricing for sort of the short-term but fluctuating driving behavior that we are seeing during COVID?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Josh. Yes, this is Michael. I would say that we are as I mentioned sort of continuously adjusting pricing levels to reflect our outlook and again, driving levels have continued to be depressed. Therefore, frequency levels have continued to be depressed. And our view is that in 2021 that will start to normalize, but we think we are going to be at depressed driving in frequency levels for a period of time. And so we are factoring that into our pricing. And as I mentioned last quarter, we filed a handful of decreases in about 5 states in the fourth quarter and we have some more plan in the first part of 2021, again, to respond to that better than long-term, normalized loss experience.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess a follow-up for Greg, I am wondering whether it\u2019s fair to say that maybe Business Insurance results were better than they look, because presumably there was some headwinds from the exposure that acts like trend and because also presumably workers\u2019 compensation represented a smaller percentage of earned premiums and I was hoping you can comment on those two factors?\nDan Frey: Hey, Meyer, it\u2019s Dan. So, mix will contribute as you suggest right in the degree that there are different loss ratios in different parts of the book are growing at different paces, that\u2019s going to have an impact. I will jump in here on this one, because on the exposure front, we have said when exposure is positive that a portion of exposure behaves like rate and therefore can be helpful to margins. It\u2019s not necessarily the case that when exposures are modestly negative as they are here that the same holds true on the inverse. Here, what you are seeing is generally lower levels of insured exposures, fewer employees, lower levels of cash register sales, things that drives GL type exposure, unless you actually got to the point where say there was wage deflation and the price per risk was going down, but you don\u2019t at least at this point have the same kind of adverse impact on margins from negative exposures that you do help to margins when exposures are running positive.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning and congratulations on the quarter, quite remarkable. Greg, you made a comment about a higher proportion of distressed business in the market. And I just want to make sure I was interpreting the comment correctly, are you talking about essentially more of a business going into excess and surplus lines or are you thinking more along the lines of just the businesses themselves are struggling with the economy?\nAlan Schnitzer: Paul, let me just jump in. And I will let Greg fix whenever I get wrong. But I think neither actually, what in a market like this where in some cases, you got some capacity issues where you got firming rate distribution generally is solving problems in the market and so the accounts that end up in the market for trading are just more difficult risks to write. So, it\u2019s not that it\u2019s necessarily moving to E&S and it\u2019s not their business is necessarily with economic issues, these are just difficult from an insurance risk perspective.\nPaul Newsome: Okay. And then just quickly investment income is also very, very strong I thought, anything in there we have been so focused on the underwriting, anything in there that we should consider this as a good run-rate or is there anything we should just be taking note of all the investment income results?\nDan Frey: Hey, Paul, it\u2019s Dan. So, I guess I point you to the net investment income slide in the webcast presentation and I\u2019d point you to Page 6. So, we gave you some outlook in terms of what we think the run-rate looks like for the fixed income portfolio. The variability that we have seen in the last three quarters has really been in the non-fixed income portfolio. And so if you look at the bottom right hand quadrant of that chart, it shows non-fixed income over the last eight quarters or so. And what you could see is sort of pre-COVID that was the last three quarters, pre-COVID had been $70 million or so of non-fixed income, then you see a big dip in the second quarter. And remember, at that time we talked about that was the impact of the disruption to the equity markets that happened in the first quarter coming through our results on a lagging basis in Q2. And then as markets have come back, we have seen some of that rebound to come through our numbers. And so what you see in Q3 and Q4 are very strong results in the non-fixed income portfolio. But if you just look at that chart, you should get the sense that part of that is to bounce back from the big dip we saw in the second quarter. And so I wouldn\u2019t take that as indicative of a new run-rate on the non-fixed income base.\nPaul Newsome: Great. Thanks, folks and congrats on the quarter again.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We have time for one final question. Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank, your line is open.\nPhil Stefano: Yes, thanks for squeezing me in at the end here. So, you had mentioned the court case in Ohio and that there is a difference in the terms and conditions and I was hoping you could just remind us what the difference in the policy wordings is that continues to give us this confidence that the BI issue is less so for Travelers than it might be for others just given how that court case went?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. So, circumstance subject to continuing pending litigation, so I am hesitant, particularly without the policy wording, there is \u2013 or certainly right in front of me to start parsing the language for you. So, maybe we can take that offline and figure out a way to do it, but probably right now, it\u2019s not the right venue. I will say, we have said from the very beginning that we have got confidence in our policies in the way we think it would respond to business interruption. So far in virtually every case we have had, we haven\u2019t had a bad outcome anyway. So I think I will just reiterate our confidence in the language that we have and say that we don\u2019t feel any differently about our business interruption exposure and leave it at that for now if that\u2019s okay.\nPhil Stefano: No, that\u2019s fine. I figured that was the answer, but it\u2019s always worth a shot. The second follow-up for you just looking at the underlying loss ratio in auto and trying to compare and contrast third quarter to fourth quarter results, is it felt like we had the story of miles driven being down auto accident frequency benefiting, but we are looking at a difference of 700 basis points give or take of underlying, how much of this is miles driven coming back, how much of this is potential short-term pricing actions that you are contemplating? How do we look at these two quarters to help us as a base for what the forward COVID impact could be?\nDan Frey: Phil, it\u2019s Dan. Let me jump in. I think we look at both of the last few quarters as extremely good results and the third quarter was maybe an outsized good result. Remember, as we have gone throughout the year, we\u2019ve been trying to set our expectation of when you look at miles driven when we then filter that through what are the specifics of our book, what do we expect to see for losses then as months and quarters go by, losses actually emerge. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a moving target. The variances have been significant, I wouldn\u2019t put a tremendous amount of stock in and the difference of what came through the loss ratio in one quarter versus the next, I think, as Michael probably indicated and as you would not be surprised by on a go forward basis, we wouldn\u2019t expect margins to continue to be that strong in auto and you see that reflected in our pricing actions in the most recent quarters. So I\u2019d step back more and think about the year in aggregate, which has definitely had a benefit \u2013 definitely had a benefit from the COVID environment and recall that in response to that we have also returned more than $200 million of premiums to policyholders. I don\u2019t know I can give you anymore specific answer than that.\nPhil Stefano: No. Great, thanks.\nOperator: The question-and-answer session has ended. It is now my pleasure to turn the call back over to Abbe Goldstein for final remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Hi, thank you all again very much for joining us. We appreciate that. And as usual, if there is any follow-up, please get in touch directly with Investor Relations. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes the Travelers\u2019 fourth quarter 2020 results conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 3, "year": 2020, "date": "2020-10-20 13:29:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the third quarter results teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 20, 2020. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our third quarter 2020 results.  We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, CFO; and our three segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Tom Kunkel of Bond and Specialty Insurance, and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under Forward-Looking Statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you Abbe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report third quarter core income of $798 million or $3.12 per diluted share, and core return on equity of 13.5%. Our bottom line result this quarter reflects strong underlying underwriting income resulting from record net earned premium of $7.4 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved 2.6 points to a strong 91.5%.  We\u2019re pleased with the underwriting results in all three segments with improved underlying profitability in both business insurance and personal insurance. In business insurance, the underlying result improved due to margin expansion as earned rate exceeded loss trends. In personal insurance, the benefits from lower frequency in the auto business more than offset higher levels of non-catastrophe weather and wildfire losses. In bond and specialty insurance, the underlying combined ratio was elevated consistent with the outlook we shared on the call last quarter. I\u2019ll note that the combined and underlying combined ratios were still under 90%, generating a solid return in a challenging environment. Profitability in all three segments continues to reflect the benefits of our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency, resulting in a [indiscernible] consolidated expense ratio.  Core income for the quarter also included catastrophe losses of $397 million pre-tax, which were meaningfully above the 10-year average for the quarter. I want to acknowledge the devastation caused by recent catastrophes. We hope for a quick recovery for all those who have been impacted. I also want to express my gratitude to our dedicated claims team for taking care of our customers during these extraordinary times. Of the 100,000 or so claim notices we\u2019ve received so far this year arising out of the record number of PCS catastrophes in the U.S., our claims team met our objective of closing more than 90% of the claims made in 30 days. A quick resolution results in a better experience for our customers and a more efficient outcome for us. I also want to acknowledge the actions our underwriting and risk management teams have taken over recent years to manage our exposure to weather volatility. In addition to the property cat aggregate treaty which has mitigated our losses, recent actions to improve the balance of risk and reward meaningfully reduced our exposure to the wildfires. To illustrate the point, in the areas impacted by the five costliest California wildfires this season, our exposure is about a third lower than it was two years ago.  Turning to our investment portfolio, this quarter we again benefited from our well defined and consistent investment philosophy with our high quality investment portfolio generating net investment income of $566 million after tax.  Lastly, before I turn to the top line, I\u2019ll share that the uncertainty surrounding business interruption claims continues to result favorably and consistent with our expectations, so we remain confident on that front. In terms of the top line and production, we continue to generate strong results. Net written premiums in the quarter grew by 3% driven by strong renewal rate change and retention in all three segments. In our commercial businesses, exposure change on renewed accounts was only modestly negative for both the quarter and year to date compared to a much more significant reduction in economic activity. We believe that in addition to generating a better underwriting result, our high quality portfolio of accounts is more resilient to economic hardship. In business insurance, we achieved record renewal rate change of 8.2%, four points higher than the prior year quarter while retention remains strong. We achieved higher renewal rate change year over year and sequentially in each of our lines of business other than workers\u2019 compensation.  In bond and specialty insurance, net written premiums increased by 4% as renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business rose to 8.1%, including record renewal rate change, while retention remained at an historical high. In personal insurance, net written premiums increased by 8% driven by strong retention in new business in both agency auto and agency homeowners. In our agency homeowners business, we achieved renewal premium change of 8.2%, its highest level since 2014. Across all of our businesses, we\u2019ve made good progress achieving rate gains and managing other levers of profitability to improve the outlook for returns in those lines that need it and will continue to execute to meet our return objectives. For all the reasons we\u2019ve discussed previously, from the loss environment to the interest rate environment, we expect continued momentum in the marketplace. Notwithstanding our focus on successfully managing through the pandemic and addressing other headwinds impacting the industry, it\u2019s important to note that we haven\u2019t been distracted from pursuing our strategic agenda. We remain focused on leveraging our scale and resources to continue to invest and innovate. As we\u2019ve said before, we believe the winners in our industry will be those with deep domain expertise that can deliver industry-leading results while innovating successfully on top of a foundation of excellence. From a position of strength, we continue to focus our efforts on extending our advantage in risk expertise, providing great experiences and improving productivity and efficiency.  In our commercial businesses, we continue to make progress in digitizing virtually every aspect of the value chain while at the same time enhancing our advanced analytics. Just as one example, our BOP 2.0 small commercial product which we launched in 2019 benefits from both. In the states in which we\u2019ve rolled it out, we\u2019ve seen about a 15% increase in both submissions and new business premiums. This product uses AI and third party data to improve underwriting segmentation, operational efficiency, and the agent experience. To that point, the artificial intelligence eases the burden on the agent and has resulted in a substantial improvement in classification accuracy.  In personal insurance, we\u2019re balancing sophisticated total account solutions with streamlined agent and customer experiences. For example, we completely redesigned the experience of our IntelliDrive auto telematics offering and introduced a distraction reading. We rolled this out in nine states during the second and third quarters and have plans to launch in an additional 10 states in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re observing a nearly 30% increase in the rate of adoption for IntelliDrive and have received strong agent feedback. Also in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re rolling out an enhanced customer self-service tool in the new mobile app.  In our claim organization, we\u2019re advancing the rollout of virtual end-to-end claims service tools, embracing the pandemic-driven trend that accelerated digital adoption by individuals and businesses. Customer and agent satisfaction are up while payout discipline remains strong. To sum it up, we\u2019re pleased with our performance in the face of a pandemic and a challenging underwriting environment. It reflects the importance of a strong underwriting culture, the benefit of data and analytics, and the franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners. All of that, together with our highly engaged and talented workforce, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the economy continues to reopen. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you Alan. Our core income for the third quarter was $798 million, generating core ROE of 13.5%, both up significantly from core income of $378 million and core ROE of 6.5% that we reported in the prior year quarter. These increases resulted primarily from this year\u2019s favorable third quarter PYD compared to net unfavorable PYD in last year\u2019s third quarter, as well as a significant increase in underlying underwriting profit. More on both of those items in a minute. Our third quarter results include $397 million of pre-tax cat losses compared to $241 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. This quarter\u2019s cats included Hurricane Laura, Tropical Storm Isaias, the severe straight-line winds that impacted the Midwest in August, and several large wildfires in the western United States. The increase in the level of cat activity was even more pronounced than those numbers suggest as our net cat result in the quarter was tempered by recoveries under the aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty. We have recognized a full recovery under that treaty in our third quarter results with $233 million pre-tax benefiting the cat line and $47 million pre-tax benefiting non-cat weather in our underlying results. Recall that last year, we did not have any recoveries under the treaty until the fourth quarter. Of course, the full recovery in this year\u2019s third quarter means that there is no coverage remaining from this treaty as we enter the fourth quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 91.5%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, improved by 2.6 points from 94.1% in last year\u2019s third quarter. The underlying loss ratio improved by 2.4 points and benefited from favorable auto frequency related to COVID-19 and the impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trends, partially offset by an increase in non-cat weather losses, including wildfires.  The expense ratio of 29.3% is two-tenths of a point favorable to last year\u2019s third quarter results and reflects our strategic focus over a number of years on improving productivity and efficiency. Setting aside quarter to quarter variability, our year-to-date expense ratio of approximately 30% is a figure we\u2019re comfortable with. Our top line proved to be resilient with a 3% increase in net written premium as continued strong renewal rate change and retention in all three segments more than offset modestly lower insured exposures in the commercial businesses.  For the quarter, losses directly related to COVID-19 totaled $133 million pre-tax with $92 million in business insurance driven primarily by workers\u2019 comp and $41 million in our bond and specialty business predominantly driven by management liability. More than offsetting those losses were lower levels of auto clients and, to a lesser extent, fewer non-COVID workers\u2019 comp and GL claims due to lower levels of economic activity. The net impact of the COVID environment o the consolidated underlying combined ratio amounted to a benefit of about two points, mostly in personal insurance. Given the ongoing uncertainty in this environment, we continue to take a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of COVID-19 related losses. Consistent with my commentary last quarter, the majority of direct COVID loses that we\u2019ve booked year to date through September is still sitting in IB&R.  Looking at the year-to-date impact of direct COVID losses net of related frequency benefits in other underwriting items, our underwriting results have benefited by a little more than $100 million pre-tax or about half a point on the consolidated underlying combined ratio, including the impact of premium refunds to policyholders. However, year-to-date net investment income reflects the significant adverse impact on our non-fixed income portfolio.  Turning to prior year reserve development, as previously disclosed, third quarter includes approximately $400 million of pre-tax benefit from the PG&E subrogation. About 80% of that benefit is reflected in personal insurance with the remainder reflected in business insurance. Setting PG&E to the side, PYD results in the quarter were as follows. In personal insurance, net favorable development of $40 million pre-tax was driven by auto results coming in better than expected for recent accident years. In bond and specialty insurance, there was no net impact from PYD. In business insurance, we recognized unfavorable development of $295 million pre-tax as a result of our annual asbestos review. While there was some slight improvement in several of our asbestos indicators, the overall level of paid losses and general claim activity has persisted at levels higher than we had anticipated.  This year, as we do every few years, we reviewed certain macro assumptions underlying our actuarial analysis. Our updated view of ultimate asbestos related losses resulted in an increase in the low end of the actuarial range. This year\u2019s asbestos charge is greater than last year\u2019s charge as a result of our updated view of the range for ultimate losses, not as a result of increases in paid losses or severity.  There are some indications that the environment is improving in terms of the emergence of new asbestos claims going forward. Page 19 of the webcast presentation includes the most recent annual data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which shows that the total number of deaths from mesothelioma in 2018 decreased by nearly 6% compared to 2010, but note, as you can see on the bottom two lines of the table, the decline in mesothelioma deaths was much more pronounced in all of the younger age groups. This trend is directionally consistent with our expectation that over time, the high risk group of people actually exposed to asbestos in the workplace prior to the late 1970s will get smaller and will not be replaced by younger people, as those who entered the workforce sometime in the 1980s should not have been exposed to asbestos to nearly the same degree as their predecessors.  Excluding the impacts of the PG&E settlement and the annual asbestos review, there was virtually not net prior year reserve development in business insurance. Favorable development in workers\u2019 comp was offset by an increase to the reserves for legacy liabilities in our run-off book related to a single insurer arising out of policies issued more than 20 years ago.  After tax net investment income increased by 7% from the prior year quarter to $566 million. The increase was driven by our non-fixed income returns, where results for our private equity hedge fund and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a one-quarter lag. Because of that reporting lag, the recovery experienced in the broader markets during the second quarter benefited our non-fixed income results in the third quarter.  Fixed income returns decreased by $31 million after tax as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by the decline in interest rates, consistent with our comments on last quarter\u2019s call. Also consistent with our prior commentary, we expect after tax fixed income NII in the fourth quarter to be down $35 million to $40 million compared to a year ago. Looking ahead to 2021, our current expectation is for after tax fixed income NII to be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter.  Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.3 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2.3 billion, well above our target level. Recall that in April, we pre-funded the $500 million of debt coming due in November with a new 30-year $500 million debt issuance, so our holding company liquidity at September 30 is temporarily elevated by that amount.  Investment yields decreased as credit spreads tightened during the third quarter, and accordingly our net unrealized investment gain increased from $3.6 billion after tax as of June 30 to $3.8 billion after tax at September 30. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $94.89 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end 2019 and up 5% year-over-year.  We returned $218 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter via dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. Looking ahead, there is no change in our approach to capital management - until there is more clarity on the state of the economy, we may buy back some shares in the coming quarters or we may continue to choose to buy none. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks Dan. Business insurance produced $365 million of segment income for the quarter, a significant increase over the prior year quarter with prior year development, underlying underwriting income, and net investment income all contributing to the year-over-year increase. The underlying combined ratio of 94% improved by almost two points, driven by more than a point of earned rate in excess of loss trends. A modest favorable net impact from the pandemic contributed about half a point to the improvement. As for the top line, net written premiums were 1% lower than the prior year quarter with strong rate and high retention mostly offsetting modestly lower insured exposures and lower levels of new business. As Alan mentioned, we are very pleased with the resilience of our top line in the face of the ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Turning to the domestic production, we achieved record renewal rate change of 8.2%, up four points from the third quarter of last year and almost a point from the second quarter of this year, while retention remained high at 83%. We feel very good about the headline number but as we\u2019ve shared before, the quality of the execution and segmentation underneath the headline numbers are just as important.  To that point, while we achieved meaningful rate increases in all product lines except workers\u2019 comp, our underwriters are making deliberate and granular decisions with respect to rate and retention on an account by account or class by class basis.  Thanks to our focus on continuous improvement of data and analytics at the point of sale, the quality of the execution is as good as I\u2019ve ever seen. New business of $505 million was 9% lower than the prior year quarter. We attribute the decline to lower levels of economic activity as well as careful risk selection by our underwriters. In our core middle market business, for example, while submissions are up, our quote ratio is lower as we have taken a disciplined approach given our view of quality new business in the market.  As for the individual businesses, in select renewal rate change increased to 2.9%, marking the seventh consecutive quarter in which renewal rate change was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. Retention of 80% was down a couple of points from recent periods, largely driven by policy cancellations that were deferred through the second quarter due to our pandemic related billing relief program.  In middle market, renewal rate change increased to 8.3% while retention remained strong at 85%. The 8.3% was up by more than 4.5 points from the third quarter of 2019 and we achieved positive rate on more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, up from about two-thirds in the third quarter of last year.  To sum up, we feel terrific about our results and execution in a challenging underwriting environment. We also feel very good about the investments we\u2019re making for the future and the benefits we\u2019re seeing from those investments. Those investments include enhancing the experiences for our customers and distribution partners, digitizing the underwriting transaction, and creating efficiencies. For example, we\u2019ve recently launched multiple pilots to automatically incorporate data from our distribution partners\u2019 agency management systems directly into our systems, substantially reducing the time and friction in the process while also improving data quality. We\u2019re as confident as ever that our meaningful competitive advantages position us well for long term profitable growth.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom. \nTom Kunkel: Thanks Greg. Bond and specialty delivered solid returns and growth in the quarter despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $115 million, a $24 million decrease from the prior year quarter as the benefit of higher volumes was more than offset by a higher underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 89% increased 5.4 points primarily driven by estimated losses from COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Given the products that we write, we expect the results of this segment to be impacted in times of severe economic downturn. We experienced that during the financial crisis and we\u2019re seeing elevated loss activity in the current environment. We contemplate economic volatility in our underwriting and in our pricing, and as Alan said, in these circumstances we feel good about the returns we generated in the quarter. We expect that the underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at around this level over the near term. Turning to top line, net written premiums grew 4% for the quarter, reflecting strong growth driven by improved pricing in our management liability business, partially offset by lower surety production due to the continued economic impact of COVID-19 on public project procurement and related bond demand. In our domestic management liability business, we are pleased that the renewal premium increased to 8.1% driven by record rate. This marks the eighth consecutive quarter in which RPC is higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. Retention remained at a historically high 90%. These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategy to pursue rate where needed while maintaining strong retention of our high quality portfolio. We will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted.  Domestic management liability new business for the quarter decreased $14 million, primarily reflecting our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Similar to what you heard from Greg in business insurance, submissions are up while quote activity is down.  The bond and specialty results remain resilient despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19. We continue to be pleased with our strong execution and feel confident about our ability to navigate through this challenging environment and continue to deliver strong returns over time. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael to discuss personal insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks Tom, and good morning everyone. In personal insurance this quarter, we are very pleased with our continued execution in the marketplace as we delivered excellent profitability and grew net written premiums by 8%, achieving record levels of domestic policies in force. Personal insurance segment income for the third quarter was $392 million, up $261 million from the prior year quarter driven by the pre-tax impacts of an improvement of $163 million in the underlying underwriting gains and $343 million of higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by $174 million of higher catastrophe losses that have reinsurance.  Our combined ratio for the quarter was 86.4%, an improvement of 11.6 points from the prior year quarter driven primarily by the increase in net favorable prior year reserve development. Higher catastrophe loss experience in the quarter was largely offset by improvement in the underlying combined ratio. The improved underlying combined ratio reflects the continuation of favorable auto loss experience in the quarter partially offset by higher non-catastrophe weather related losses. I\u2019ll discuss both of these dynamics in a bit more detail next.  Agency automobile profitability was very strong with a combined ratio of approximately 80% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 81% improved nearly 12 points, continuing to reflect favorable frequency levels. Approximately eight of the 12 points of improvement relate to current quarter favorability. The remainder results from favorable re-estimates of activity in the first half of 2020. We continue to observe lower claim frequency as a result of fewer miles driven in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the third quarter, data from our IntelliDrive program indicates that miles driven increased relative to last quarter but continue to be down from pre COVID-19 levels. In response to this continued favorable loss experience, we filed modest rate reductions in a handful of states during the third quarter. We will continue to analyze and incorporate current trends into our underwriting and pricing decisions as we balance business volumes and profitability. In agency, homeowners and other, the third quarter combined ratio was 92.8%, an improvement of 9.2 points from the prior year quarter resulting from 26 points of higher net favorable prior year reserve development, mostly from the PG&S subrogation recoveries, partially offset by elevated levels of catastrophe losses and an increase in the underlying combined ratio driven by higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses.  Our catastrophe and non-catastrophe experience reflects a very active quarter with a record 31 PCS events. West coast wildfires represented almost half of the total PCS events in the quarter. Consistent with Dan\u2019s comments earlier, the quarter\u2019s catastrophe losses for personal insurance were also impacted by the Midwest [indiscernible], Tropical Storm Isaias, and to a lesser extent Hurricane Laura.  In addition to pursuing rate increases in property as we have been for some time, we continued to review and modify terms and conditions and to implement loss mitigation actions in response to the elevated loss activity. Our actions to date have enabled us to reduce or avoid losses we would have otherwise incurred and improve returns as we continue to grow the line.  Turning to quarterly production, our domestic agency results were again very strong. Our retentions remained high, quotes and new business were up versus the prior year quarter, and we remain pleased with our policies in force growth. Agency automobile retention was 84% and new business increased 9% from the prior year quarter, both contributing to accelerating growth in policies in force. Renewal premium change was again lower as we continue to moderate pricing in response to favorable loss activity. Agency, homeowners and other delivered another very strong quarter with retention of 86% and a 22% increase in new business. Renewal premium change increased to 8.2% as we remain focused on improving returns in property while growing the business.  During the quarter, we continued to respond to the needs of our customers and distribution partners. First and foremost, let me add my thanks to our claims professionals for delivering on our commitment to be there for our customers and distribution partners in response to the significant number of catastrophe and weather events in the quarter. At the same time, we continued to deliver new capabilities in the marketplace. Alan already mentioned both IntelliDrive and our new My T-Mobile app, both of which are key tools in helping us attract and retain customers.  We also expanded the availability of our digital quote proposal that gives agents and brokers the ability to send a Travelers Insurance quote to their client\u2019s mobile phone and interact with them digitally about the terms of the proposal, making the transaction more seamless for both the agent and the customers.  After reaching our goal of planting one million trees for customer enrollment in paperless billing, we extended our partnership with American Forests to plant an additional 500,000 trees by Earth Day 2021. We have already achieved that milestone well in ahead of schedule, providing our customers the digital experience they seek while benefiting the environment. These examples and others illustrate our ability to develop and deliver the capabilities our partners and customers value.  We are very pleased with our performance so far this year and I\u2019m proud of our teams\u2019 efforts to continue to deliver results while investing in the business for the future.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much. Operator, we\u2019re ready to start Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning, thanks. First question, if we can talk about some of the reserve changes during the quarter. Thanks for all the commentary. I believe, Greg, when you were talking about business--the BI segment, you didn\u2019t mention any additions to general liability, and I believe that had been--you\u2019d been adding to that in prior quarters. Can you confirm if that was indeed the case, and maybe just overall too, Alan or Greg, if you guys can talk about whether your view has changed at all on overall loss expense trend. \nAlan Schnitzer: Good morning Mike, it\u2019s Alan. Let me start with loss trend and then maybe I\u2019ll turn it over to Dan to talk about prior year development. In the quarter, putting aside for a second the direct COVID losses in the quarter, generally what we saw was favorable loss activity primarily related to COVID, and so think people staying home, less economic activity, lower levels of frequency. As you heard us say last quarter and as you heard us repeat again this quarter, we\u2019ve taken a very cautious approach to recognizing that favorable news. There is still a fair amount of uncertainty, and so we\u2019re going to be cautious about that; but we didn\u2019t see anything in the quarter that surprised us or caused us to think that loss trends were deteriorating. Dan, why don\u2019t you comment on PYD?\nDan Frey: Sure. Mike, just to go through business insurance\u2019s PYD just for a second, a quick recap of the summary. It ended up being about $220 million unfavorable all-in, that\u2019s driven by about $295 million, as we said, on asbestos, then there was favorability from BI\u2019s portion of the PG&E settlement, and I said that was worth about 20% of the $400 million, so that\u2019s $80 million of a good guy. That gets you to about 215 compared to the 220, so the other moving parts you could think about are as net offsets, and those are favorable in workers\u2019 comp, unfavorable for a single account in run-off from policies that we issued more than 20 years ago. And then, we didn\u2019t mention the other lines because it was really very modest activity in the other lines, some pluses and some minuses that basically net to zero.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. My last question is, I guess, in regard to the overall competitive environment. Alan, in your prepared remarks, you talked about expected continuing momentum in the marketplace. I think what we\u2019re trying to get comfortable with is the investment income levels - thank you for the guidance. Clearly, they\u2019re under a lot of pressure, and I think in our shoes, we haven\u2019t been in a firm to hard marketplace in a while, so we\u2019re trying to get comfortable that the pricing momentum in excess of loss trends will continue because it seems like to offset BI pressure, we have to get to meaningful better combined ratios in outer years.  Maybe just some more color on if you guys--you know, when you say continued momentum, do you expect pricing to continue moving higher or are these levels kind of good enough for you guys to start chipping away at offsetting some of the investment pressure? \nAlan Schnitzer: Well clearly, Mike, written rate is ahead of loss trends, so we\u2019re definitely making progress at these levels, and we\u2019re not going to give pricing outlook but we do choose our words pretty carefully. I\u2019ll tell you that the fact of the matter is that for us and for the industry broadly, there are just many lines of business that are not yet rate adequate, and the drivers are clearly environmental. On the loss side, social inflation isn\u2019t going away. We\u2019ve got weather losses, we\u2019ve got wildfires that are burning. As you pointed out, interest rates are lower for longer - that\u2019s going to be a driver of the outlook for returns. We do have some capacity issues in some lines as there are some markets that are pulling back on capacity, so we think this broader environmental--all of these broader environmental trends will continue to provide positive momentum in the marketplace.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey thanks, good morning. I guess my first question is it sounds like the COVID benefits you\u2019re enjoying are frequency based, mostly short tail lines, so I should take that to mean that you\u2019ve continue to book in lines like commercial auto similarly to the type of loss trend that you thought coming into the year, which I would think would be above your average loss trend, correct?\nDan Frey: Yes Ryan, it\u2019s Dan. That\u2019s right. As we\u2019ve said, I think last quarter and this quarter, we\u2019re trying to be cautious in our assessment of the net impact of COVID. There is some benefit in the shorter tail lines, but we\u2019re trying to be pretty cautious in terms of how much of that we recognize in the current accident year.\nAlan Schnitzer: But in terms of the casualty coverages, as you mentioned, yes - that\u2019s correct.\nRyan Tunis: I totally understand that. Just trying to get some perspective on--clearly we don\u2019t know what frequency is going to be. There could be delays in reported claims, etc., but just from your seat looking at the type of claim activity that\u2019s coming through the door, if that were to hold true, what\u2019s the type of frequency benefit on commercial auto that, I guess, we\u2019re not at this point seeing in results yet?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, you know, we\u2019re reluctant to put a number on that. I think we\u2019re not going to do it, Ryan. Frequency - you know, it does develop, but it develops certainly a lot more quickly than severity does. You know if the phone rings or if the phone doesn\u2019t ring, but I think we\u2019re going to leave it as we recognized some of it because there was enough of it that we couldn\u2019t not recognize some of it, but we\u2019ve been pretty cautious in the assessment.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. Then the other follow-up I had, I guess probably for Dan, is thinking about just the aggregate treaty, I guess it kind of worked this year but is also kind of didn\u2019t, because we\u2019re going into the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve gone through the top. How are you thinking about the strategy about reinsuring cats, I guess headed into \u201921? Are you thinking about doing more aggregate cover or maybe going lower? Is that something that we should expect potentially to be a catalyst for next year?\nAlan Schnitzer: Ryan, before Dan answers that question, I\u2019ll just insert that I think the treaty actually worked just fine. It was the weather that didn\u2019t work so well.  Dan, do you want to take--\nDan Frey: Ryan, I think we\u2019ll do as we would do for reinsurance in any--going into any year. We\u2019ll make an assessment of price versus risk and then decide what and how much we\u2019re going to buy. I think I\u2019d say in summary, we\u2019re glad that we\u2019ve had that treaty for the last two years. To your question specifically about do we go to a lower attachment, I wouldn\u2019t think so. We\u2019ve got a growing business and if anything, we probably would go naturally to a higher attachment point, just to reflect the growth in the business. But maybe we\u2019ll buy that reinsurance again and maybe we won\u2019t. It will depend how we feel about the risk transfer relative to the pricing that we can get, because again we\u2019re writing with the idea that we\u2019re a gross lines underwriter, and we said a couple years ago it felt like there was a little more uncertainty in the weather environment and so we wanted to have that treaty, and we\u2019re glad we had it. We\u2019ll see how that plays out going into next year.\nAlan Schnitzer: The other thing I would add to that, Ryan, is--and Dan\u2019s exactly right, we bought that because we wanted to acknowledge the incremental uncertainty that we felt after some wildfire losses, I guess in \u201917 and \u201918. But as I mentioned in my prepare remarks, we\u2019ve taken pretty substantial steps to try to get that risk-reward in balance, so that would also factor into our view of the value of that reinsurance treaty and the terms we can get it on next year.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. My first one, I guess, is maybe some commentary about workers\u2019 comp. I think that given where interest rates are, at some point we should start to see that line see some positive rate momentum, and that\u2019s an important component. But what are your thoughts on that line right now?\nAlan Schnitzer: Greg, you want to take that?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, you bet. Good morning, Brian. First, we like our longstanding competitive and economic advantages that we\u2019ve got out of that line, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re the largest writer in it in the U.S. Sure, there\u2019s a little bit of pricing reductions going through that line right now and that always puts some pressure on existing margins, but we aren\u2019t standing still. We continue to invest in our claim practices specifically around medical management sophistication, and our underwriters, we\u2019re always giving them new tools and new insight to make sure our risk selection and our renewal segmentation offset some of those price reductions. Workers\u2019 comp is just one piece of our portfolio. As we remind you all the time, we\u2019re more of an account solution than an individual monocline writer, and we\u2019ll continue to write our customers with accounts in additions to workers\u2019 comp, so we continue to feel good about the portfolio and the future of that line.\nBrian Meredith: That improvement in select, was that due to comp maybe getting less competitive, the rate in select?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Well, both select and middle market are clearly going to follow the linear trend of the bureau\u2019s loss cost recommendations, and so in the select business where it\u2019s more of a flow business, where you file that rate structure, you feel it more there than you would in middle market where you have experience mods and discretionary pricing, and you look at the individual exposure rather than file it at a state level, so a little more sensitive to the reductions in select than you would see in middle market. \nBrian Meredith: Great, then just one quick follow-up for Dan. The aggregate cover this quarter, is it possible to break out how much of that benefit is non-cat weather versus cat losses?\nDan Frey: Yes Brian, I gave it actually in my prepared remarks.\nBrian Meredith: Oh sorry, I missed it.\nDan Frey: It\u2019s quite all right. We said $280 million was the total recovery, $233 million went to cat and $47 million went to underlying.\nBrian Meredith: Got you, and that\u2019s largely in the personal lines?\nDan Frey: The split is a little different between the two. The cat split is about 50/59 PI/BI. The non-cat split goes more like 70/30 PI/BI.\nBrian Meredith: Great, very helpful. Thank you.\nDan Frey: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question is also on the aggregate cover. Given that you guys have exhausted that cover, and this is a comment that is specific to business insurance, how can we think about the improvement within the underlying loss ratio that you could see there in the fourth quarter? I guess we could expect some kind of headwind from non-cat weather, just given the absence of the aggregate, or how should we think about the fourth quarter? \nDan Frey: Elyse, it\u2019s Dan. The aggregate is, as I just said in response to Brian\u2019s question, is not a big deal to the underlying or business insurance in the third quarter, so it got about 30% of the $47 million that was non-cat, so you could think about that for BI as not being more than 20 or 30 basis points in terms of its impact on the quarter.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, so if we adjust BI for that and then also for the COVID benefit that you guys pointed out earlier, is that a good type of run rate to think about for the margin improvement that we could see in the fourth quarter? \nDan Frey: Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d expect the COVID impact to cease as of September 30. Certainly the cat recovery, the treaty recovery is all contained in the third quarter and you could take that out for sure. I\u2019m not sure anybody knows what exactly the impact of COVID is going to be in the fourth quarter.\nAlan Schnitzer: Or what weather volatility is going to look like. I think we\u2019re going to get away generally from trying to forecast margins, but happy to take modeling questions offline if that\u2019s helpful, Elyse, to the extent we can.\nElyse Greenspan: Yes, and then my second question was on the expense ratio. Dan, I think you said that 30% was kind of a good run rate, but as we\u2019re thinking--and maybe this is less guidance, but I think you guys did guide with at least that, as you\u2019re getting a good amount of price and that\u2019s earning in, should we expect that we could see some improvement in the expense ratio just due to the denominator, or is it counterbalanced by some investments that you pointed out that you guys have been making internally?\nDan Frey: I think those are the considerations, Elyse, that will go into what it ends up being. I do think to the degree that we can get some bottom line growth, we would be in a position to continue to see some leverage on the expense ratio. But as we\u2019ve said a number of time over the last couple years, what we like about productivity and efficiency that we\u2019ve generated is it gives us the optionality of whether we make additional investments in places that we feel are going to provide a bigger bang for the buck down the road, or let some of that come through the bottom line. All it was really trying to communicate was that we don\u2019t--we\u2019re not seeking a dramatic change in the expense ratio from where we are right now.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks Elyse.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, good morning everybody. Two unrelated questions. The first one is about surety, and can you tell us a little bit about the premium volume - it looked pretty reasonable in the bottom, especially business. What are we seeing in terms of COVID economy for construction starts and whatnot?\nTom Kunkel: This is Tom, Josh - good morning. When you think about surety, if you break it up the non-construction and the construction side, our regular non-construction surety is holding up quite nicely, but with all of the decline in tax receipts and the difficulties that various public bodies are having funding public works projects, that\u2019s what is really driving the drop-off in surety written premium. You know, we will have to wait and see what the federal government does with any stimulus that might involve construction, because certainly states and other entities have shovel-ready projects. \nJosh Shanker: Is there implication for things that have already begun construction? Is there a risk that we start seeing issues with surety claims because they\u2019re not able to be finished? \nTom Kunkel: They\u2019re two different issues. As far as the projects stopping, unless they\u2019re ordered to stop by government authority, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see a project that is ongoing stopping. Then as far as the slower economy causing additional defaults, that certainly is possible. It really depends on the contactors\u2019 and the surety\u2019s portfolio and how sound their financial position was going in, and how they handle pursuing work or not pursuing work and shrinking the size of their company when times are lean. We take a lot of pride in our contractors when we manage that portfolio, and we think different sureties will perform differently throughout this.\nAlan Schnitzer: Josh, I\u2019d just add to that, that we\u2019re underwriting that commercial surety book, the construction surety book today the same way we did in the financial crisis, and it performed pretty well through that. We can\u2019t give any assurances - who knows, but we feel pretty good about our underwriting practices and the people who are making the decisions to put business on the books.\nTom Kunkel: Yes.\nJosh Shanker: Then a philosophical question. If we go back in time maybe 10 years, I don\u2019t know when, when you came up with the Travelers\u2019 definition for catastrophe, and of course it varies from the PCF definition, it seems as time goes on, the risk associated with non-cat weather gets greater and greater in terms of volatility on your margin. Is the variance between your definition and the PCF definition still useful, or have we gotten to a point where the reasons for that difference are starting to create a certain volatility in results that we wouldn\u2019t otherwise hope to see?\nAlan Schnitzer: Josh, we think about that a lot, so I appreciate the question. Maybe someday offline, we\u2019d love to get your thoughts on it. Our view is from an economic perspective, the losses are going to be what they\u2019re going to be, whether they get reflected in a cat line or in an underlying line. Frankly, we report the numbers we way we manage the business, and we think that there is a level of loss activity that is defined as a PCF event that is in a working layer, if you will, and that ought to be managed day in, day, out, year in, year out by the underwriters that are managing it, as compared to a catastrophe loss which we obviously define as a higher level which gets managed and addressed over a much longer period of time.  We think it\u2019s the right way to manage the business. We think it\u2019s the right way to talk about the business internally, and we make the decision to talk about it externally the same way we manage it internally. I get that it might from time to time cause some modeling issues or definitional issues, but we think the consistency and the thoughtful approach to managing it is sort of the right way to run the railroad. \nJosh Shanker: Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the call, for the answers.  I was hoping you could hone in on the competitive environment in the auto insurance business in particular. We\u2019re seeing in the market different things from the rate environment. Obviously you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing, but was it a materially more competitive market today than it was recently, and--and I\u2019ll just give you my follow-up question, which is I\u2019d like to know how that competitive environment links up with what you\u2019re doing in the home insurance business, where you\u2019re clearly growing and my sense is the home insurance business is pretty much an outright hard market, so a different situation. Those are my two questions.\nAlan Schnitzer: Michael?\nMichael Klein: Thanks Paul, it\u2019s Michael Klein. On the competition in auto, certainly we are seeing market rates drop, and I think it\u2019s fair to call it an intensifying competitive environment. That said, for the most part, notwithstanding some of the headline numbers you see from some key competitors, it\u2019s still a relatively moderate adjustment in personal lines auto pricing, and from our perspective largely reflective of the improvement in experience in the line, some of it COVID related but, frankly, some of it consistent with longer term trends of favorable frequency that we and other competitors have talked about. In terms of our ability to compete in that environment, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks and you see in the webcast script, we\u2019re pleased with our improving [indiscernible] growth in auto as we moderate pricing, again intentionally to keep pace with those loss trends. Again as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that does include taking some price decreases in a handful of states to, again, match premium to loss, pricing with loss experience. That\u2019s sort of our view on the PI competitive environment. Jumping to your second question about home, I would agree - if you look at the personal insurance industry right now, it\u2019s a little bit of a tale of two cities, right? You\u2019ve got improving loss experience and moderating frequency in auto putting downward pressure on prices. You\u2019ve got a lot of what we\u2019ve been talking about here this morning - catastrophes, non-catastrophe weather, there are still folks in the industry talking about non-weather water losses as well, but the pressure on loss costs in the property business is upward. We\u2019re pleased with our progress in RPC in property. We\u2019re pleased with the performance of our Quantum Home 2 product as we\u2019ve rolled that out, and again as we look at the property market in personal insurance as we\u2019ve described it, our objective is to grow property while improving profitability, and that\u2019s the path we\u2019ve been on and we\u2019ll continue to be on.\nPaul Newsome: I guess what I was trying to ask is, how much is the link between the willingness to grow in home versus the auto?\nMichael Klein: I would say we look at it as a portfolio. Our strategy is to be a portfolio provider and work with our partners to provide total account solutions to customers, and so we are actively seeking to grow both lines and, again, at target returns.\nPaul Newsome: Great, thank you. Appreciate it.\nMichael Klein: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just had a question just on NII and the impact it has on ROE for the firm. The NII guide of 420 to 430 after tax per quarter, do you think that you can get enough margin expansion to offset the NII drag to keep ROE stable in this environment, and is there enough pricing and margin expansion underneath where you can actually improve ROEs in this interest rate environment?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes well, we think the answer to that is yes, and if you look at written rate versus loss trend, margins are improving from here. We\u2019re not going to give guidance so I\u2019m not going to predict whether we will or whether we won\u2019t, but certainly interest rates and investment income are an input into our pricing model, and so there\u2019s certainly a very direct link between the investment return we\u2019re getting on the product and the price we\u2019re charging for it.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay, great. Thanks. Then just another follow-up - you know, you mentioned, I think Greg mentioned getting rate in excess of loss trend of over a point in BI. I guess I\u2019m just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what gives you confidence that you\u2019re getting rate in excess of trend, just given the uncertainty around the loss environment, courts being closed, and just generally the unpredictability of losses in the current environment.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, so just to be clear, we look at rate versus loss trend on a written basis, and that\u2019s the rate number you see in production statistics, and we\u2019ve shared before our view of loss trend. That one point was sort of the earned impact of rate and earned loss trend, so two different bases there. You know, at this point where we\u2019ve got rate in excess in 8% and we\u2019ve got loss trend which we shared last quarter we view on a long-term basis at 5%, yes, there\u2019s some uncertainty but that gap is big enough that we feel some confidence in that. It\u2019s true that in the circumstance like this where you\u2019ve got a disruption in the economy and some disruption in the data coming through, and in the claim process there\u2019s a little more uncertainty than usual, but as I shared previously, what we\u2019re seeing in losses is actual favorability. Again, not perfect clarity into it and it\u2019s going to take some time for us to get more clarity and for that uncertainty to resolve, but the thing that we\u2019re not reacting to is favorable news, not unfavorable trend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Hi, good morning everybody. First question around workers\u2019 comp, clearly--or I\u2019m assuming there is a frequency benefit from non-COVID claims; on the other hand, I would think that that frequency benefit could ultimately result in some severity increase further down the road. Is that a fair way of thinking about it, and if so, how are you thinking of the loss picks with that dual dynamic?\nAlan Schnitzer: It\u2019s certainly a possibility, and we contemplate that. Yes, there is some favorability in non-COVID related frequency, but we do contemplate when we think about longer term trends and when we think about the profitability of the product, that there could be down the road some increased severity due to really delayed access to healthcare, so we do contemplate as a possibility.\nYaron Kinar: And is that reflected in the picks already or is that something that you\u2019ll be thinking about as you move into 2021 and beyond?\nDan Frey: It\u2019s Dan. I\u2019d say both, which goes to the comment that we\u2019ve made a couple time about being cautious in our view of the net impact of COVID, and we\u2019ll continue to consider that as we think about the product on a go-forward basis.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Then Alan, I know you and the firm, you\u2019ve been vocal about social inflation trends, particularly in commercial auto the last couple years. With courts being shut down, now starting to reopen, are you seeing any change in the trend or is it too difficult to tell, just given all the COVID-related noise today?\nAlan Schnitzer: I guess what I can share is we didn\u2019t see anything that caused us to believe that there was any deterioration in those trends, and what we saw was, again as I said a few times, favorable. We think the extent to which it\u2019s favorable is a temporary phenomenon, so I guess that\u2019s how I\u2019d answer the question. Nothing in the quarter that caused us to think anything was deteriorating. \nDan Frey: Yes. At the same time, we certainly don\u2019t think that social inflation has gone away, and so our long-term expectation is that the sort of elevated levels of losses that we\u2019ve seen related to social inflation probably persist.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Thank you for the answers.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. First, I just had a question on pricing in the workers\u2019 comp line - obviously it\u2019s been declining. Are you seeing any signs of stability in that, or what are you views on where that\u2019s headed?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think, Jimmy, I\u2019d repeat what we said last quarter, which is when we look at our data, we look at the data coming out of rating bureaus, we would think that we are somewhere near an inflection point. Whether it\u2019s now or in the coming quarters, not really sure, but we would expect in the relatively near-ish term for that pricing to come back to negative, and then turn positive. It\u2019s impossible to pick the exact quarter or date that\u2019s going to happen, but that would be our near term outlook.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay, and then you mentioned you\u2019ll evaluate price versus risk on reinsurance. It seems like the reinsurance prices are obviously going up a decent amount. Any sort of initial indications of your views on price versus risk, given what\u2019s going on in the reinsurance markets versus last year? \nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, we certainly expect reinsurance pricing to go up - that\u2019s one of the factors that\u2019s driving our pricing and the pricing generally in the primary market going up, and we think that\u2019s going to persist. I guess the thing I would add as it relates to us is we are, as we\u2019ve said many times, a gross line underwriter. We like our underwriting, we intend to keep it, and so compared to many of our--many in the industry, we buy on a relative basis less reinsurance, and frankly we could buy even less than we do. We could buy a little more, we could buy a little less depending on the risk and reward that we see in that purchase. To the extent that we\u2019re relatively less reliant on reinsurance than others, the fact that reinsurance pricing\u2019s going up is probably a benefit to us.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay, and then just lastly, what are some of the things that you\u2019re watching to determine whether to start buying back stock again?\nDan Frey: I think Jimmy, there\u2019s still overall economic uncertainty, right, so even as we sit here today, what\u2019s the depth and duration going to be of economic downturn, is there going to be a second dip in the economy, how quickly are COVID cases going to be brought under control, how quickly are things going to reopen, there\u2019s just still a lot of uncertainty that could impact both our top line and the loss environment in which we\u2019re operating, so we\u2019re choosing to be a little cautious here still. Clearly through the third quarter, on top of all that, we had a very active cat quarter, so it just didn\u2019t feel like the right time to be restarting buybacks.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay, thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one further question. Our final question today will come from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thanks. I think it was Dan before - and I apologize for not knowing for sure - that talked about how you were taking a conservative view of accident year loss picks in light of uncertainty, and only recognizing the frequency benefit that you had to. Was there a sort of similar approach taken to reserve reviews in the quarter?\nDan Frey: Meyer, it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019m not sure I quite understand the question. The reserves will be a result of the loss picks that we made in the current accident year during the quarter.\nMeyer Shields: Right, so if I understand correctly, there is an overall conservatism because of the fact that things are developing differently as we work our way through COVID and the economic ramifications, and I\u2019m wondering whether that conservatism had an unusual impact on the selections you made with regard to reviewing prior period reserves as well.\nDan Frey: Yes, I wouldn\u2019t think so. I think the comment that Alan just made a few minutes ago around the impact of courts being closed and settlements being down, we see some disruption in the data but we\u2019re not taking that as a favorability in the development patterns that we\u2019re assuming on a long-term basis. \nMeyer Shields: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. A second follow-up if I can, really quickly. How should we think about the impact on return on equity or on indicated pricing if corporate tax rates go up?\nAlan Schnitzer: Taxes are an input in the income statement, like any other expense, and so it flows through the models.\nDan Frey: Yes, so that would be one of the many things that gets factored into our pricing. Obviously it wouldn\u2019t just impact us, it would impact the economy more broadly, and as Alan said a bunch of times, I think if we feel like we\u2019ve got a level playing field with our experience and our risk section expertise, we\u2019ll do just fine. But for sure, it will be an input into what the pricing environment needs to be going forward. \nMeyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. Thank you so much. \nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks Meyer.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back to Abbe Goldstein for closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you all very much for joining us this morning, and as always, if you have any follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Hope everybody has a good day. Thanks. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Welcome to the Second Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time, you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 23, 2020. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, please go ahead.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our second quarter 2020 results. We released our press release, financial statement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we shared in our pre-release last week and again this morning, we reported a small net loss for the quarter due to a high level of catastrophe losses and, as we expected, a loss in our non-fixed income investment portfolio. Dan will have more to say about both shortly. Our underlying underwriting income of $572 million pre-tax was up $254 million over the prior year quarter, benefiting from solid net earned premium and a 3.5 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio to a strong 91.4%. The pandemic and related economic conditions had only a modest net impact on our underwriting results. As I shared in my prepared remarks last quarter, there will be COVID-19-related loss activity, but there will be some offsetting decline in losses due to people across the country sheltering in place. For us, in the quarter, $114 million of direct losses and $63 million of audit premium adjustments were about offset by initial estimates of favorable loss activity, most of which is in short-tail lines. Given the continued uncertainty, we\u2019ve taken a cautious approach to recognizing the net impact of COVID-19-related loss activity. Some industry observers have speculated about the aggregate level of insured and investment losses arising out of the pandemic. We don\u2019t doubt the losses will be significant, but they won\u2019t be borne evenly across insurers. Our manageable COVID-related insurance losses so far this year are a reflection of our disciplined approach to risk selection, as well as terms and conditions. And as we shared with you in some detail last quarter, we manage our investment portfolio with a similar regard to balancing risk and reward. Last quarter, I commented on the potential future impacts the pandemic might have on each of our key lines of business. I\u2019ll review that again with a quarter\u2019s worth of experience. In personal auto, we\u2019ve seen a meaningful drop-off in auto frequency, although that is moderating as economic activity picks up. At the same time, we\u2019ve taken into consideration the potential for some offsetting impact in terms of auto severity due to factors such as collisions occurring at higher speeds and driver distraction. In workers\u2019 compensation, COVID-related claims mostly relate to healthcare workers and first responders, which do not represent a significant part of our book of business. Also, the frequency of those claims stabilized during the quarter, which might be attributed to an improved supply of PPE and the healthcare community having the benefit of more experience with managing COVID patients. More probably beyond the healthcare sector, data from some of the state workers\u2019 comp systems suggests that the COVID-related claim rate is low relative to the infection rate. That\u2019s likely partly attributable to the fact that the population most seriously affected by COVID-19 skews older and is not the workforce. Nonetheless, in developing our loss estimates, we\u2019ve taken into consideration the potential for the delayed reporting of claims and additional claim activity associated with recent spikes in infection rates, as well as uncertainty related to the longer-term implications of the disease. As we anticipated, some states have effectively expanded the scope of workers\u2019 comp coverage by creating presumptions of compensability. In most cases, states have taken a thoughtful approach protecting workers appropriately, but not unreasonably burdening the workers\u2019 compensation system. Where states have acted to expand compensability, we\u2019ve adjusted our loss estimates accordingly. In terms of non-COVID workers\u2019 comp losses, we\u2019ve seen the lower volume of workers\u2019 comp claims as workers have stayed home. This will abate as people get back to the workplace. In addition to taking that into account, we have contemplated that severity could be adversely affected by injured workers delaying treatment due to the stay-at-home work environment. Having said all that, our experience is that there\u2019s a low level of worker\u2019s comp claim activity associated with economic recessions. During periods of elevated unemployment, workers tend to be more motivated to stay at their jobs and the workforce tends to be more seasoned. In management liability, as we expected, we\u2019re seeing the elevated level of claim activity, typically associated with stock market volatility and workforce reductions. The underlying combined ratio this quarter in Bond & Specialty reflects that, as well as other loss activity. And we expect that the underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at this level or somewhat higher over the near-term. This is not the likely experience we had in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago. Nonetheless, we expect the return from this segment will continue to be healthy. Turning to the surety business. We\u2019ve been pleased to see that work is continuing on the vast majority of construction projects. However, the depth and duration of stressing the economy continues to be risk factors of the surety business The line will also be impacted by other factors, such as the financial strength in the bonded firms. As I shared last quarter, our high-quality surety book was effectively stress tested in the 2008 financial crisis and performed well, and our underwriting approach has remained disciplined since that time. In that regard, so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything that has caused us to change our surety loss estimates. In terms of business interruption coverages under commercial property policies, there\u2019s a fair amount of litigation challenging coverage. As a reminder, our commercial property insurance policies that include business interruption, including as a result of civil authority, require losses to be caused by direct physical damage to property from a covered cause of loss. In addition, our standard policy forms specifically exclude loss or damage caused by or resulting from a virus. A few court decisions we\u2019ve seen so far, one in New York and one in Michigan, have both upheld the physical damage requirements in the context of COVID-19. On the legislative front, efforts to retroactively expand coverage for business interruptions seem to be diminishing. Finally, with respect to liability coverages. As people shelter in place, we are seeing fewer commercial auto accidents and slip-and-fall type claims. Anecdotally, we are also seeing some movement by the Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar to settle claims faster, but it\u2019s too soon to know how significant that benefit might be. We\u2019re also encouraged by states that have adopted COVID-related liability protections and similar efforts that are underway in other states and at the federal level. We shouldn\u2019t let frivolous lawsuits undermine the nation\u2019s recovery. Nonetheless, we expect the Plaintiffs\u2019 Bar to continue to be active. Turning to the quarter on the top line, we\u2019re very pleased with our production results. Excluding the auto premium refunds we provided to our customers, net written premiums grew by 2%, as the impact of COVID-19 on insured exposures was more than offset by strong renewal rate change in all three segments. In Business Insurance, we achieved renewal rate change of 7.4%, the highest level since 2013 and close to the record level we achieved that year. Excluding workers\u2019 comp, renewal rate change was double digits. Importantly, retention levels remain strong. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 3%, as our domestic management liability business achieved a record renewal rate change, while maintaining strong retention. In Personal Insurance, excluding the other premium refunds, net written premiums increased by 6%, driven by strong retention and new business in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. In our Agency Homeowners business, renewal premium change remained strong at 7.7%, and we hit a record for new business. Let me take a minute to comment on the commercial rate environment. Before the pandemic struck, there were a number of industry-wide factors putting upward pressure on prices, namely increased volatility of weather-related losses, interest rates at historical lows, and a growing recognition of higher loss trend in the liability lines. All of those conditions persist. And now, at another quarter with a very high-level of weather-related losses, interest rates that are likely to be lower for longer, and while it hasn\u2019t been a significant factor for us, the reinsurance market that is hardened. And on top of that, the pandemic and related economic fallout add a sense of incremental uncertainty, making this feel like one of those times, not unlike in the wake of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, when the market recalibrates risk. With that as the background, we\u2019ll continue to seek rate gains and manage other levers of profitability to improve the outlook for returns. I\u2019ll close by saying that I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to my Travelers colleagues for their grit and commitment to taking care of our customers, our business partners, our communities and each other. Also, the work they\u2019ve done in recent years to advance our innovation agenda has equipped us with state-of-the-art digital tools and other capabilities that make all the difference in this environment, we were well prepared. And from here, we\u2019re well positioned. Free from financial and operational distractions, we\u2019ll continue uninterrupted, managing our business and investing for long-term success. In short, we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to succeed through these uncertain times and to benefit from the strength of our franchise as the economy recovers. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Our core loss for the second quarter was $50 million, compared to core income of $537 million in the prior year quarter. The change resulted primarily from a higher level of catastrophe losses and, as expected, lower net investment income. For the quarter, the net impact related to COVID-19 is included in our underlying results, not as part of our cat figure and was modest, more on that in a minute. Our second quarter results include $854 million of pre-tax cat losses, compared to only $367 million in last year\u2019s second quarter. This quarter\u2019s cats include severe storms in several regions of the United States, as well as $91 million of losses related to civil unrest. Regarding our property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty for 2020, as of June 30, we have accumulated about $1.4 billion of qualifying losses towards the aggregate retention of $1.55 billion. The treaty provides aggregate coverage of $280 million, or $500 million of losses above that $1.55 billion retention. The underlying combined ratio of 91.4%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, improved by 3.5 points compared to 94.9% in last year\u2019s second quarter. The underlying loss ratio improved by more than 4 points, and benefited from a lower level of non-cat weather losses, favorable frequency in personal auto from the shelter in place environment, net of related premium refunds, and the impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend. The expense ratio of 31% is 0.8 point higher than the prior year quarter and above our recent run rate. This change was, as expected, due to the reduction in premiums associated with the pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy, along with the premium refunds to our personal auto customers. The net impact of COVID-19 and its related effects on the economy were modest in terms of our overall second quarter underwriting income. Our top line was resilient. Excluding the premium refunds in Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 2%, driven by strong renewal rate change in all three segments that more than offset lower insured exposures. In terms of operating expenses, results were adversely impacted by modest increases in the allowance for bad debt and the accrual for supplemental commissions. Those expense increases, however, were roughly offset by lower expenses in other categories, for example, travel costs were down as our employees continue to work primarily from home. The economic impacts related to COVID-19 also affected our underlying losses. For example, losses directly related to COVID-19 totaled $114 million, primarily workers\u2019 comp in Business Insurance and management liability losses in our Bond & Specialty business. On the other hand, we experienced significant reductions in auto claims, as there were fewer cars on the road during the second quarter, and to a lesser degree, recognized the benefit, reflecting fewer traditional workers\u2019 comp claims as more people work from home. As you heard from Alan, given the uncertainty in the current environment, we took a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of COVID-related losses. We have recorded the estimated cost for all losses incurred through June 30, including incurred losses for which claims have not yet been recorded. All losses have been recorded at our estimate of ultimate, and the majority of the COVID-19-related insurance losses we have booked in the first and second quarters are still sitting in our IBNR reserves. We have not recognized losses or benefits from COVID-19-related insured events that we anticipate will occur subsequent to the end of the quarter. Taking a step back on a year-to-date basis, the impact on our results, excluding net investment income from COVID-19 and its related effects is a net charge of about $50 million pre-tax. Turning to prior year reserve development. In Personal Insurance, both auto and property losses came in better-than-expected for multiple accident years. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we saw larger losses than expected in management liability, resulting in prior year strengthening of $33 million, largely offsetting the favorable development in Personal Insurance. In Business Insurance, there was no net prior year reserve development, as better-than-expected loss experience in workers\u2019 comp and commercial property, was largely offset by unfavorable results in our other casualty lines. Each of the movements this quarter was relatively small compared to the reserve base. As you saw in our July 14 press release, we expect to record subrogation benefits in our third quarter PYD of approximately $400 million pre-tax related to PG&E successful emergence from bankruptcy on July 1. As a reminder, third quarter PYD will also include the results of our annual asbestos review. After-tax net investment income decreased by 54% from the prior year quarter to $251 million, somewhat better result than we had previewed in our call last quarter. The decrease was driven by our non-fixed income returns, where results for our private equity hedge fund and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a one quarter lag. Accordingly, the impact of the disruption in global financial markets that occurred in the latter-half of the first quarter impacted our second quarter results. As the broader markets have recovered in the second quarter, that should, at least to some extent, benefit our non-fixed income results in the third quarter. It\u2019s worth mentioning here that recoveries may not be reflected in the private equity and hedge fund results as quickly as the downturns were. Given continued economic uncertainty, fund managers will report their results to us and may take a more measured approach and not be as quick to write back up the valuations they just marked down, particularly in light of what may be continued challenging prospects for the earnings and cash flows of the fund\u2019s underlying investments. Fixed income returns decreased by $24 million after-tax, as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by the decline in interest rates and the mix change, as we chose to maintain a somewhat higher level of liquidity and held more short-term investments than in prior quarters. For the remainder of 2020, we expect that fixed income NII will decrease by approximately $35 million to $40 million after-tax per quarter, compared to the corresponding periods of 2019. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.7 billion were again very strong, all our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of slightly more than $2 billion well above our target level. Recall that in April, we prefunded as we normally do $500 million of debt coming due in November with a new 30-year $500 million debt issuance at 2.55%. So our holding company liquidity is temporarily elevated by that amount. Investment yields decreased, as credit spreads tightened during the second quarter. And accordingly, our net unrealized investment gains increased from $1.8 billion after-tax as of March 31 to $3.6 billion after-tax at June 30. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $92.01 at quarter-end, down less than 1% from year-end and up 2% year-over-year. We returned $218 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter via dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. As we indicated in our first quarter earnings call, our capital management strategy remains unchanged. With the ongoing economic uncertainty and with hurricane season upon us, it still feels to us like holding on to a little more capital is preferable to holding on to a little less. Until there\u2019s more clarity on the state of the economy, we may buy back some shares in the coming quarters, or we may continue to choose to buy none. Coming back to reinsurance for a moment, let me direct your attention to Slide 19 of the webcast presentation for a summary of our July 1st renewals. The structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior year. We renewed our Northeast cat treaty effective July 1 with substantially similar terms and pricing that was up only slightly on an exposure adjusted basis. Our cat bond, Long Point Re III, is now in the third year of its four-year term. In the annual reset for the 2020 hurricane season, the attachment point was adjusted from $1.79 billion to $1.87 billion, while the total cost of the program is flat year-over-year. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, including our general cat aggregate XLO treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our 10-Q, which we filed earlier today and in our 2019 Form 10-K. Lastly, let me take a minute to address thoughts on our top line going forward. Looking at premium volume, we expect to experience the impacts of economic disruption. How much of an impact we feel and for how long will depend on the extent and duration of the negative economic impacts related to the pandemic. Because earned premium typically lags written premium, we expect to feel the effects on an earned basis beyond the end of the year. As Alan said last quarter, we do not intend to take disruptive actions \u2013 expense actions in response to what may prove to be a short-term impact on premium volumes. Accordingly, in coming quarters, the expense ratio will likely remain somewhat elevated compared to the corresponding periods of 2019 due to the expected impact on earned premiums. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to all my Travelers\u2019 colleagues, as well as our agent and broker partners for continuing to provide exceptional service to our customers during these unprecedented times. As for the quarter\u2019s results, Business Insurance had a loss for the quarter of $58 million, due to lower net investment income and higher catastrophe losses, as both Alan and Dan discussed. The combined ratio of 107.1% included more than 10 points of catastrophes, impacted by both weather-related losses and civil unrest. The underlying combined ratio of 97% improved by 0.4 points, reflecting a 0.2 point improvement in each of the underlying loss ratio and expense ratio. The net impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions was modest. Turning to the top line. Net written premiums were 3% lower than the prior year quarter due to the impact of the economic disruption on insured exposures. Thanks to excellent execution by our field organization. These impacts were largely offset by strong renewal rate increases and high retention. Turning to domestic production. We achieved strong renewal rate change of 7.4%, while retention remained high at 83%. The renewal rate change of 7.4% was up almost 4 points from the second quarter of last year and more than 1 point from the first quarter of this year, notwithstanding the persistent downward pressure in workers\u2019 compensation pricing. We continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book, as rate increases in all lines other than workers\u2019 compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the second quarter of last year. We achieved positive rate on about 80% of our middle market accounts this quarter, which was up from about two-thirds in the second quarter of last year. Importantly, we\u2019ve achieved this progress in a highly segmented manner and with retention remaining strong. At these rate levels, our rate change continues to exceed loss trend, even after about a 0.5 point increase to our loss trend assumption. New business of $473 million was down 10% from the prior year quarter. New business flow was down, which we attribute largely to disruption caused by the pandemic. New business was also impacted by our continued focus on disciplined risk selection, underwriting and pricing. These production results reflect superior execution by our field organization in a very challenging environment. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change was up to 2.1%, making the sixth consecutive quarter where renewal rate was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter, while retention was strong at 82%. The headwind from workers\u2019 compensation pricing is most pronounced in the Select business. New business was down significantly, driven by the economic disruption caused by the pandemic. While the current environment is challenging, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re well-positioned in investing in the right strategic capabilities to profitably grow this business over time. In Middle Market, renewal rate change was up to 7.9%, while retention remained strong at 86%. The 7.9% was up almost 4.5 points from the second quarter of 2019 and 1.5 points from the first quarter of 2020. New business of $255 million was down from the prior year quarter, driven by both economic disruptions and our continued focus on disciplined risk selection, underwriting and pricing. To sum up, we believe our meaningful competitive advantages, including our strong distribution relationships and our talent and expertise, position us well as we navigate through these uncertain times and continue to serve our customers and agent and broker partners. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered solid returns and growth in the quarter, despite the impacts of COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Segment income was $72 million, a decrease of $102 million from the prior year quarter. As Dan mentioned, the combined ratio of 93.8% reflects unfavorable prior year reserve development in the quarter, as compared to favorable PYD in the prior year quarter and the higher underlying combined ratios. The underlying combined ratio of 88.1% increased 7.1 points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the impacts of higher loss estimates for managing the liability coverages, about half of which was due to COVID-19 and related economic conditions. Remaining half of the increase is due to a few smaller drivers, such as elevated claim activity under employment practices liability coverages and ransomware losses under cyber policies. Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 3% for the quarter, reflecting strong growth in our management liability and international businesses, partially offset by lower surety production. In our domestic management liability business, we are pleased that renewal premium change increased to 7.8%. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter, where RPC is higher than the corresponding prior year quarter. As Alan noted, renewal rate change was a record for the quarter, while retention remained at a historically high 89%. Similar to Business Insurance, RPC in the quarter was also impacted by lower insured exposures. These production results demonstrate the effective execution of our strategy to pursue rate where needed, while maintaining strong retention of our high-quality portfolio. We will continue to pursue rate increases where warranted. Domestic management liability new business for the quarter decreased $13 million, reflecting the disruption associated with COVID-19 and our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Domestic surety net premium \u2013 net written premium was down $24 million in the quarter, reflecting the impact of COVID-19, which slowed public project procurement and related bond demand. International BSI posted strong growth in the quarter, with record rate in our UK management liability businesses. So Bond & Specialty results remain resilient despite the challenges brought on by COVID-19. These results reflect the excellent work of our agents, brokers and employees who have adapted to operating in new ways to continue to provide leading products and services to our customers. We feel confident about our ability to navigate through this challenging environment and continue to deliver strong returns over time. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Personal Insurance segment income for the second quarter of 2020 was $10 million, down from $88 million in the prior year quarter, driven by a higher level of catastrophe losses and lower net investment income. These impacts were partially offset by an improvement in the underlying underwriting gain. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 101.3%, an increase of 1.1 points and the 12.5 point increase in catastrophe losses was largely offset by a 10.6 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio benefited from lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and lower automobile losses net of premium refunds. The increase of 2.6 points on the underwriting expense ratio was primarily driven by the reduction in net earned premiums, resulting from the auto premium refunds. Turning to the top line. Excluding the impact of premium refunds of $216 million, net written premiums grew 6%. Agency Homeowners and other net written premiums were up an impressive 13% and Agency Automobile net written premiums were up 3%, excluding premium refunds. Agency Automobiles delivered strong results with a combined ratio of 85.7% for the quarter. The loss ratio improved over 12 points, while the underwriting expense ratio increased by about 4 points. The increase in the underwriting expense ratio was primarily driven by the impact of the premium refunds I described earlier. The underlying combined ratio of 84.2% improved 9.6 points relative to the prior year quarter, continuing through reflect improvements in frequency, primarily due to fewer miles driven as a result of the pandemic. Data from our IntelliDrive auto telematics program indicates miles driven were down significantly from pre-COVID-19 levels during the second quarter, reaching a weekly low point in early April and partially rebounding as the economy has started to reopen. In response to our improved auto loss experience, we implemented a stay-at-home auto premium credit program for personal automobile customers. In the U.S., the program provided a 15% premium refund on April, May and June premiums. In Agency Homeowners and other, the second quarter combined ratio was 113.9%, 9.4 points higher than the prior year quarter, due primarily to higher catastrophes, partially offset by a lower underlying combined ratio. Historically, the second quarter is our highest catastrophe quarter. This quarter, we experienced significant storm activity, resulting in 34 points of catastrophe losses, an increase of 21 points compared to the prior year quarter, where catastrophes were relatively low. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 81.4%, down over 11 points from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses. The majority of the improvement is due to elevated non-cat weather in the prior year quarter. Non-catastrophe weather-related losses this quarter were also better than our assumptions. Turning to quarterly production. Our domestic agency results were solid, despite the challenging environment resulting from COVID-19 and its related economic impacts. Our retentions remained strong, closed and new business were up versus the prior year quarter, and we remain pleased with our policies in force growth. Agency Automobile retention was 85% and new business increased 7% from the prior year quarter. Renewal premium change was 1.5%, as we continue to moderate pricing, given the improved performance in our book over the past few years. Agency Homeowners and other delivered another very strong quarter, with retention of 87%, renewal premium change of 7.7%, and a 17% increase in new business, as we continue to seek to improve returns while growing the business. Higher new business levels again benefited from the successful rollout of our Quantum Home 2.0 product now available in over 40 markets. During the quarter, we continue to deliver new capabilities and products to our customers and distribution partners. We introduced Quantum Home 2.0 in four new states, including California. In addition, we launched IntelliDrive 2.0, which adds distracted driving monitoring to our auto telematics product and delivers significant improvements to the user experience. And after reaching our goal of planting 1 million trees for customer enrollment and paperless billing, we extended our partnership with American Forests to plant another 500,000 trees by Earth Day 2021. To recap, Personal Insurance is off to a strong start in the first-half of the year, particularly in light of a challenging environment. I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s efforts to continue to work together to meet the needs of those we\u2019re privileged to serve while investing in the business for the future. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael. Before we begin Q&A, there\u2019s one topic that we expect might be on people\u2019s minds. So we thought we would kick off Q&A by addressing it. So before we open up the line, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thanks, Abbe. There has been some discussion by industry observers about the timing of the recognition of COVID-related losses. So let me reiterate that our reserves reflect our best estimate of ultimate losses incurred as of the balance sheet date. In applying accounting principles, we would not record a reserve for a loss that has not yet occurred as of the balance sheet date. Using auto claims as an example, at the beginning of the year, we have an assumption as the volume of claims we will see over the course of the year and what the average cost of those claims will be. But when we report our second quarter results, including our balance sheet loss reserves as of June 30, those reserves do not include estimated amounts for auto accidents that will occur at Thanksgiving or on New Year\u2019s Eve. Those would be fourth quarter events, and accordingly, they will be recognized in our fourth quarter results. The same principle applies when we consider losses related to COVID-19. While only some losses have been reported to us so far, the losses we booked in both the first and second quarter reflect our estimate of the ultimate amounts that we\u2019ll pay for all losses and related costs that have been incurred as of June 30, including those for which we have not yet received a claim. In fact, as I said earlier, the majority of the COVID-related insurance losses we have booked through June 30 are still sitting in our IBNR reserves. That said, the pandemic is clearly not over, and tens of thousands of new infections are being confirmed in the United States each day. It is foreseeable that a healthcare worker, for example, who, to this point, has not contracted COVID-19, will become ill from COVID-19 as a result of their job duties in December. But again, that loss activity will be included in our fourth quarter results. We similarly would not advance the recognition of any continued favorability from lower frequency and non-COVID workers\u2019 comp claims. Finally, I\u2019ll remind you that on a year-to-date basis, setting aside net investment income, the impact on our results from COVID-19 and its related effects is a net charge of about $50 million pre-tax. And with that, operator, we\u2019re ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Phillips: Thank you. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for the clarification, Dan, on your last comment, so that\u2019s helpful. I guess, I want to try to get arms around Business Insurance and margins and pricing. Trying to kind of pull out the effect of COVID, you said, COVID was pretty modest in the quarter. Pricing was clearly very strong. Yes, core margins improved 40 bps or 20 bps on the well side. So, I guess, trying to understand, is \u2013 does that mean \u2013 and Alan, you gave us great commentary on pricing. Does that mean that the current level pricing still isn\u2019t enough to expand margins today? Or kind of how do we think about that versus the level of conservatism that might be baked into the \u2013 to the current numbers?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Michael, good morning. It\u2019s Alan. I\u2019ll start by giving you a response to what\u2019s on your mind. At the current levels, written rate is in excess of loss trend. So, looking narrowly at those factors, we are on a written basis expanding margins. Is that where you\u2019re getting at?\nMichael Phillips: It is. Yes, it is. I guess in business interruption, you had 20 basis points of improvement. So, not as much as maybe one would expect given a level of pricing. And so that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get my arms around.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. So, as always, there are a number of factors that are driving the underlying combined ratio in the quarter, and that\u2019s true for any business. So you\u2019ve got weather. So year-over-year, that was better. And in this quarter, sort of within the normal level of variability, we would expect for that. You\u2019ve got the earned impact of rate that, as I said, on both written and earned basis, rate is ahead of loss trend. We\u2019ve had improved performances in some business. You\u2019ve got some impact of COVID, it was modest, but not zero. You\u2019ve got the year-over-year sort of ongoing carry-on impact of social inflation that I\u2019ll call old news, what \u2013 the \u2013 what we\u2019ve recognized in prior periods and it continues to roll through. So, those are \u2013 given the relative stability, we\u2019re not going to quantify the pieces. But essentially, those are the pieces.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. No, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Alan. I guess, I didn\u2019t see you mention \u2013 and I guess, this is good news, didn\u2019t see you mention of anything on the commercial auto side for PYD. And so maybe could you speak to kind of that piece? And does that mean that there has been possibly some leveling off of the paid activity that\u2019s been part of the concern there?\nDan Frey: Michael, it\u2019s Dan. Yes, as we had last quarter, so we had some movements in PYD, some puts and takes, some continued good news in comp, some continued pressure in the other liability lines. There were small adjustments in commercial auto and the general liability lines in CMP. But as I said in my remarks, relatively modest compared to those reserve bases.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to get a better feel for just \u2013 forget about the net benefit from the COVID. Just from the direct losses alone or the direct impact, what was the hit that, that had in business interruption on the combined ratio?\nAlan Schnitzer: Business interruption specifically or Business Insurance?\nRyan Tunis: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, Business Insurance without considering the offsetting benefits, what was just the direct loss impact or direct hit impact on that number?\nDan Frey: Yep. Ryan, it\u2019s Dan. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to give the pluses and the minuses. But within the \u2013 we told you that there was $114 million of directly related charges. And while that included some charges for the management liability coverages in Bond & Specialty, the majority of what we took came through Business Insurance.\nRyan Tunis: Okay. And then, in terms of thinking about the benefits that we\u2019re seeing, I think, in the preannouncement, you said it was mostly short-tail lines. But \u2013 so should we take that to me \u2013 I mean, first of all, outside of the short-tail lines, are you seeing actual to expected look a little bit better in some areas in terms of the frequency? And is that not something \u2013 and if so, is that something that you\u2019re not recognizing yet? You\u2019re being conservative and waiting to see if that continues to be the case?\nDan Frey: Yes, Ryan, it\u2019s Dan, again. So we are, for sure, seeing some favorable indications relative to what you would otherwise expect in this current environment. And when we look at that, there was too much favorability to simply say, zero is the right reaction. But as Alan said in his comments and as I tried to reiterate in mine, I think, we\u2019ve been very cautious in terms of the degree to which we\u2019d recognize any good news in anything other than the short-tail lines. But there\u2019s some, because it\u2019s very apparent in the data.\nRyan Tunis: And then just one more real quick. I was, I guess, a little bit surprised exposure growth held in \u2013 I think, especially in Select lines, retention has only declined modestly. How should we interpret that? Is retention \u2013 is it capturing cancellations? Or is that modest dip, mostly a function of you guys taking more rate? I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to interpret those numbers that seem relatively modest, given what\u2019s happening in the macro landscape?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes, Ryan, let me take \u2013 this is Greg. Let me take both of those in the order that you took on. Number one, in terms of exposure change, if you\u2019re looking at relative to Middle Market, that\u2019s really a product mix dynamic. In the Select business, we have \u2013 the thrust of the premium is two product, CMP and workers\u2019 comp. In the CMP product, the rating on that is driven more off of property than the GL. And so, we\u2019re continuing to see pricing and inflationary pressure on the property. And so there\u2019s some inflationary impact that, that impacts on the CMP product. And so you don\u2019t see as much of a drag on exposure on Select that you do on Middle Market, where the GL product is more on a standalone-rated basis. And then the retention overall, for Select, we certainly put our estimate of what we see in terms of business insolvencies, bankruptcies, and that\u2019s all inside the 82% number.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Greg, if I heard you correctly in your prepared comments, you talked about a 50 basis point increase in loss trend. And I was hoping you could flush that out a little?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Sure, Meyer. Yes, we look at loss trends every quarter and across the full portfolio, and that\u2019s obviously a headline number. What we did this quarter is, we looked at the impact of the new economy that we see in front of us. We also look at some of the social inflation or liability dynamics that Dan just talked about. When we roll that all up in aggregate, we believe we\u2019ve got a 50 basis points increase in our loss trend in front of us.\nAlan Schnitzer: The thing I\u2019d add to that, Meyer, is that, that is reflected in the underlying combined ratio we reported for the quarter as is a piece of that, that would be catch-up from the first quarter.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That last point is exactly what I was looking for.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes.\nMeyer Shields: Second question, I guess, with workers\u2019 compensation being the most vulnerable to exposure unit pressure, does that impact rate need on the expense ratio side?\nAlan Schnitzer: Say the question again?\nMeyer Shields: I\u2019m trying to understand, I know that in general, workers\u2019 compensation pricing has been coming down, because the industry experience has been good, but we seem to be seeing a fairly significant exposure unit headwind. And I\u2019m trying to get my arms around what that implies for indicated pricing?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Meyer, there\u2019s a heavy regulatory component to pricing, as you know, and it tends to be a little bit backward looking. And it sort of factors in the overall profitability of the line, which is, as you know, has been very favorable over the years and that will continue to be the case. So, clearly, exposure will be one impact on profitability today, which will impact pricing tomorrow. But it\u2019s really hard to isolate any one in \u2013 any one factor and its impact on profitability, because everything goes in, you\u2019ve got \u2013 you start with your expiring rate and then you\u2019ve got whatever the rate change is and you\u2019ve got exposure change, you\u2019ve got loss trends, things like that. So it\u2019s definitely a factor. It\u2019s hard to isolate what the extent of the impact is.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAlan Schnitzer: Good morning, Elyse.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. Could you hear me?\nAlan Schnitzer: No. That \u2013 we hear you now.\nElyse Greenspan: Sorry. Thank you. In terms of Business Insurance, I was hoping for the COVID-19 losses. And I recognize in response to an earlier question, maybe you aren\u2019t giving just the loss impact in Business Insurance, specifically by line. But could you give us a sense of where you saw the majority of your COVID losses, that\u2019s ignoring the favorable impact in the second quarter just specifically within Business Insurance?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes, Elyse, so that\u2019s what I had tried to do. So we took $114 million across the enterprise in direct COVID losses. None of that was in Personal Insurance. There was some component of management liability within Bonds & Specialty Insurance, which Tom described and going through their combined ratio. But the majority of those dollars came through Business Insurance.\nAlan Schnitzer: So, Elyse, are you asking for a breakdown by product line?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes. I was hoping by product line, even if not in terms of dollars, you could just give us a sense of which Business Insurance product lines saw the majority of your COVID losses?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes. The largest line, for sure is workers\u2019 comp, some property losses, both domestically and internationally. And then dribs and drabs, I would say, in other lines, but those are the two drivers with the comp by far being the largest.\nAlan Schnitzer: And, Elyse, I\u2019d point you to my prepared comments or what I did share that this was a modest net impact when we look at the offsetting of the favorable frequency on some of those lines also.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thanks. And then my second question is maybe a follow-up on the prior question on workers\u2019 comp. We\u2019ve heard a few folks in the industry, it seems like starting to point towards the bottom of costs in terms of just the pricing dynamics there. But if I go back to your comments throughout the call, it doesn\u2019t sound like you guys are thinking that the rate declines that we\u2019ve seen in that business are close to coming to an end. So if you could just help us think about worker\u2019s comp in terms of the pricing dynamics there, and whether we might hit an inflection, and I\u2019m not just talking 2020, perhaps even into 2021 as well?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Elyse, it\u2019s a great question. When you look at the information coming out of some of the rating bureaus and when we look at our own, we would say that we are sort of at or near a bottom in workers\u2019 comp pricing.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. One last numbers question. Could you give us a \u2013 you said that they were small numbers. But is there \u2013 could you give us a sense of the dollars in terms of the adverse development within general liability and commercial multi-peril in the quarter?\nDan Frey: We\u2019re not going to do that, Elyse. They\u2019re all pretty modest.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. And, Dan, I guess, I appreciate the comments that you made just before the Q&A. But I guess, I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us some sense of how you\u2019re thinking about COVID-related adverse impacts throughout the rest of the year. Just looking through your portfolio of exposures and thinking how it might be affected by COVID, even if the losses haven\u2019t occurred yet in the first-half. And you have the exposure and you think there\u2019s a possibility that there could be a loss on it. Just wondering to get some thoughts there. I figured I\u2019d take a shot at that?\nAlan Schnitzer: David, good morning. It\u2019s Alan. Let me start with that. And if I miss anything, I\u2019d like Dan to take it up. We\u2019re not going to forecast future losses. Our obligation under GAAP is to report the incurred and unreported losses as of the balance sheet date, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. It\u2019s hard to forecast the future. There\u2019s some uncertainty. We don\u2019t know the trajectory of the disease. We don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to have a vaccine. We don\u2019t know what the outlook for the economy is. And frankly, it\u2019s \u2013 probably the uncertainties for the economy that have the biggest impact on \u2013 of the pandemic on us. But I do think it\u2019s relevant to \u2013 and that\u2019s why we pointed it out a few times that our net losses in the first-half of the year were \u2013 net charges were about $50 million putting aside the investment side. And we\u2019ve put up that net number with a high degree of caution. So I can\u2019t give you a number. We \u2013 I tried in my sort of line by line review to tell you some of the factors that we think about. But I think it\u2019s not irrelevant to that assessment to think about our experience in the first-half of the year.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that, Alan. And then just one more. So excluding workers\u2019 comp, the renewal rate change, so it was pretty strong, you said double digits. Wondering if we could get a finer point put on that, and then just sort of how that compares versus the last few quarters? And also, sort of thinking about and I think, Dan, you had mentioned you\u2019re looking at loss trend of 5% now in the updated thinking. And that\u2019s, I guess, what I should be comparing to the 7.4% renewal rate change that you got in the quarter?\nDan Frey: Yes, I think that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s Dan. I think, that\u2019s the right way to think about rate versus trend, and that\u2019s about \u2013 that\u2019s the ballpark. I think we\u2019ve said previously, that trend was around 4.5% in BI and we\u2019re taking it up about 0.5 point in the current quarter. But you got to look at that in, in relation to the pricing momentum as well. And I think, Greg could correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But the pricing momentum you see in this quarter is a reflection of the strength of the market and the continued need for rate.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add there to your point, outside of comp, all of our products were positive. And so we feel great about that execution and mostly, the changes line up with where the need is also.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay, great. And if I could just sneak one more in on the adverse development in general liability. Hoping to get a little bit more color in terms of what you saw in the quarter that, I guess, brought you to make that change, because I thought that, most of the courts were closed during the quarter. I would think the page would be nothing really accelerated during the quarter? Or was it more just a view of \u2013 yes, or was it more just an ongoing review that resulted in the change there?\nDan Frey: Yes. David, it\u2019s more of the latter. And remember, as we\u2019re doing reserve reviews, especially in long-tail lines like those, you\u2019re looking more backwards at your data. So the actual loss environment of May and June, we\u2019re aware of it, but it\u2019s not really \u2013 you don\u2019t have enough time to gather all that data and fully factor into the reserve view that you\u2019re making at that time. So a little more that is still backward-looking in terms of way things have developed, say, through the first quarter.\nAlan Schnitzer: But again, as Dan noted in his remarks, those were relatively small movements.\nDavid Motemaden: Yes. Great. Understood. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPaul Newsome: You\u2019ve hit the big ones for me, but one just quick one. From an investment perspective, do you have expectations that we would see increased defaults as well come through and I guess that we will see them realized? And is that sort of booked into the investment expectations that you gave us this quarter as well? I\u2019m thinking the actual defaults that we might see from the recession?\nDan Frey: Yes. Paul, it\u2019s Dan. We gave a fair amount of detail and did a fair amount of commentary on the construct of the investment portfolio and our comfort level with the way we thoughtfully invested. And we\u2019ve given you an update of that investment detail again in the appendix of the webcast presentation this quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t say more than we said, I think, last quarter in terms feeling really good about the way we\u2019ve managed risk on the asset side of the balance sheet, clearly, we\u2019re aware of and looking and looking at and have a regular process to assess credit impairment and default rates and all of that stuff is baked into our numbers. But it\u2019s really not a big impact on us, given the thoughtful investment approach in the first place.\nPaul Newsome: Has ratings migration had much of an impact yet, if at all, on the capital calculations for you guys?\nDan Frey: No, it does not.\nPaul Newsome: Great. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Just two quick ones here. First one, what was the impact of premium adjustments on the BI written premium this quarter like comp and CMP?\nDan Frey: I\u2019m not sure I understand the question, Brian.\nBrian Meredith: Meaning like for workers like reevaluating like what \u2013 like employment stuff is on workers\u2019 comp. You usually do it in the fourth quarter, but were there\u2019s any kind of early ones where you adjusted premium kind of to reflect what it\u2019s going look like the year?\nDan Frey: So I wouldn\u2019t say we normally do it in the fourth quarter, I think, what you\u2019re referring to maybe is we do it at the \u2013 when the policy period has ended and we\u2019d like to go up.\nBrian Meredith: Yes.\nDan Frey: There has been some \u2013 and we\u2019ve been open to it, there have been some more requests by customers to do some of that midterm. But all that\u2019s baked into our production statistics and the written premium numbers we reported for the quarter, Brian, and you got to break out that one piece.\nBrian Meredith: Okay, thanks. And then the second, just a quick question, just to understand the 50 basis points of increase in trend in the BI. Is that inclusive of what you\u2019re seeing with respect to COVID-19 and maybe the benefits or adverse stuff you\u2019re seeing on COVID-19? Or is that more related to what\u2019s going on with just general kind of tort inflation and some of the increase you saw in your GL reserves and your CMP reserves?\nDan Frey: I think we\u2019re \u2013 we consider everything, Brian, and included in there. And there are some puts and takes, the net of the puts and takes was 0.5 point increase to the trend.\nBrian Meredith: Right. And just on that \u2013 following on that, Alan, you made some comments about maybe some favorable stuff happening in the court system as far as some early quick settlements. But in general, what\u2019s your kind of take on what\u2019s going on with tort right now? could we potentially see an increase in tort inflation as a result of what\u2019s going on with COVID-19?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. I mean, I think, we certainly could, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re such big proponents of liability reform. I think it\u2019s important in terms of making sure we\u2019re protecting the nation\u2019s recovery from the pandemic. I think, you hear a lot of rhetoric out there on that topic. But every \u2013 everything we see and everything we\u2019re anticipating is in that loss trend number.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question coming from the line of Jamminder Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamminder Bhullar: Good morning. So first, I had a question on just the commercial auto business. If you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of frequency, is that picking up as traffic\u2019s been increasing recently? And then relatedly, just your views on the rate adequacy in that line, given that you\u2019ve been raising prices for a while? Or do you think rates need to go up further?\nGregory Toczydlowski: This is \u2013 Jamminder, this is Greg. Yes, we certainly have seen some favorable frequency activity, as the shelter at home has taken place, certainly not to the levels of Personal Insurance. And just as a reminder, in commercial auto, it\u2019s a little unique and personal, where we do have lay-up credits or premium credits when there\u2019s limited use. And so, there\u2019s a slight offset as we see that frequency. We have mechanisms to give that back. Now as the economy is starting to reopen, we\u2019re seeing that frequency moderate.\nJamminder Bhullar: Got it. And on the personal auto side, are you assuming or expecting additional refunds in the third quarter results?\nGregory Toczydlowski: So we don\u2019t have further refunds planned in personal auto. I think, like many, we\u2019re looking forward at what rate adequacy is over time and looking at more traditional mechanisms like rate filings to make sure that rates are in line with loss trend and loss cost. And in personal auto, the refunds really were a mechanism to respond to acute \u2013 an acute issue in the early days of the pandemic is sort of the way we\u2019re thinking about it.\nJamminder Bhullar: Okay. And then just lastly, you mentioned majority of the COVID losses were related to workers\u2019 comp. You didn\u2019t really mention anything about business interruption, and I\u2019m assuming those losses were pretty modest. But is that more, because you haven\u2019t seen a lot of claim submission? Or is it just your view \u2013 you have seen submissions, but your view is that those claims are uninsured, given the policy language?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. We\u2019ve certainly seen some submissions, and there\u2019s some claim activity around it and even some litigation around it. As we\u2019ve noted, we\u2019ve got provisions in our policies that we think make that coverage inapplicable. And so we don\u2019t expect many of those claims actually to pay out.\nDan Frey: It\u2019s Dan. One related comment to that. Even where we don\u2019t expect ultimately to pay the indemnity on a loss, we have acknowledged in our reserves the fact that we\u2019ll spend some money defending against claims that come in for business interruption.\nJamminder Bhullar: Okay. And on COVID, is that the line where you see the most uncertainty in terms of claims, given what happens on in terms of litigation activity? Or are there other lines where there\u2019s not a lot of clarity based on what\u2019s happened so far?\nAlan Schnitzer: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around business interruption. I mean, certainly, there\u2019s some, because there\u2019s some litigation and there\u2019s always uncertainty when you have litigation. But we \u2013 we\u2019ve got the requirement for direct physical damage. We\u2019ve got two courts that have upheld that so far. And we\u2019ve got a specific virus exclusion in our standard policy form. So we don\u2019t actually see a lot of uncertainty there, and we don\u2019t expect that to be a material loss contributor for us.\nJamminder Bhullar: Okay.

Welcome to the first quarter results teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 21, 2020. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2020 results. Given the current circumstances, we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of those materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.  Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and they will take questions -- then we will take questions.  Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The events of the last few months have been challenging for all of us and our hearts go out to all those affected by the global crisis. Before I get to the impacts of the pandemic on our business and comment on our first quarter results, I'd like to acknowledge some acts of courage.  First, I want to express our appreciation for the thoughtful actions taken by our leaders and government at all levels to keep us safe and support the well-being of individuals and businesses. Their actions remind us that a society-wide pandemic requires a society-wide response. We would also like to extend our deep gratitude to the courageous efforts of health care professionals and first responders, to their selfless commitment to protecting and saving lives. And for all the essential workers who are putting others first as they continue to fill prescriptions, stock shelves, deliver goods and provide the other key services we all depend upon. Literally and figuratively, they are keeping the lights on, and we're grateful.  In addition, I want to acknowledge and thank all of my 30,000 colleagues, many of whom are listening this morning for their exceptional response to this crisis. Employees across Travelers have stepped up in amazing ways to ensure that we can continue to deliver the risk management products and services that our customers need to live their lives and run their businesses as well as the outstanding uninterrupted service that our customers and agent and broker partners have come to expect. Thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of Travelers' employees and the tremendous efforts of our technology and operations teams, we transitioned our workforce practically overnight to safely and effectively work from home. A few months ago, it would have been hard to envision that we would have more than 29,000 people simultaneously logging in remotely and that we would be hosting more than 80,000 virtual meetings on a daily basis, but we are doing just that.  As we have discussed over the last few years, we've been making investments in talent and technology. And those investments are paying off in terms of our ability to keep our employees safe and take care of our customers and business partners. As a company, we are also grateful to be in a position to support those impacted by COVID-19, including through customer billing relief, our stay-at-home auto premium credit program, our distribution support plan, accelerating the payment of more than $100 million of commissions for agents and brokers and a direct $5 million pledge to assist hard-hit families and communities. This pandemic has created a tremendous amount of uncertainty for all of us. Nonetheless, let me turn to highlighting some of the potential impacts of COVID-19 and the macroeconomic environment on our business.  I'll start with the top line. As you've heard us say, as a property and casualty insurer, we're a GDP-based business. We ensure the output of the economy. As a result, we and the industry will be impacted by lower premium levels as the economy contracts. How much and for how long will depend on the extent and duration of the negative economic impacts related to the pandemic. We've always been very attentive to our expense base, and we continue to be thoughtful in that regard. In the context of the current environment, we will make adjustments to our expenses where it makes sense. But we do not plan to make significant adjustments to our fixed expense base in response to short-term fluctuations in business volumes. Accordingly, as a consequence of pressure on the top line, we expect an increase in our expense ratio in the near term.  In terms of our investment portfolio, the economic follow-up from the pandemic will impact our net investment income. Dan will have more to say about that shortly. Turning to loss costs, there will be COVID-19-related loss activity. But generally, as exposures decline, there will, to one degree or another, be some corresponding decline in losses. What that will mean in terms of profitability will depend on the relationship between the decline in earned premium and the decline in losses. In other words, loss ratios could improve or deteriorate, and that will vary by line. Short-term impacts could also be different than longer-term impacts.  Turning to some of our key lines of business. In Personal Auto, in recent weeks, we have seen a meaningful drop-off in auto frequency. As a result, we announced our stay-at-home auto premium credit program, offering a premium credit to our customers for April and May. At the same time, there may be some offsetting impact in terms of auto severity. For example, severity could be impacted as lower levels of traffic results in collisions occurring at higher speeds.  Turning to our commercial businesses. In workers' compensation, while it varies by state, generally, claims for injury or disease are compensable when the employee demonstrates that the injury or illness arose both out of and in the course of their employment. With respect to COVID-19, these claims will most likely be applicable in the case of health care workers and other first responders, which does not represent a significant part of our book of business. Some states have taken steps to effectively expand the scope of workers' comp coverage by creating presumptions of compensability. Other states are considering doing the same. There are a few dynamics to this that argue for policymakers and regulators to take a careful approach.  First, from a marketplace perspective, shifting the exposure to the workers' comp system will increase loss costs. That will be reflected in rate making, increasing the cost of workers' comp insurance going forward. Also, those states that have workers' compensation funds would presumably bear their proportionate share of the cost. In any event, we're watching this closely. In management liability, there is potential for elevated frequency. For example, under public company D&O policies, we generally associate stock market volatility with a higher frequency of claims related to securities class actions. However, given the breadth of the market decline, causation may be harder for plaintiffs to prove in those cases. Also by way of example, underemployment practices liability coverage, we expect additional claim activity related to the increase in furloughs and layoffs of employees. Surety loss activity for the industry and for us could be elevated depending on the duration of the economic shutdown and the depth and duration of stress in the economy. While projects have been impacted by shelter-in-place orders, our sense is that the vast majority of projects have been permitted to proceed and contractors are currently still working. We believe that force majeure or other provisions included in many construction contracts would, as a general matter, provide relief to contractors for late completion due to COVID-19.  Surety loss experience will also be impacted by other factors. For example, the financial strength of the bonded firms, the types of bonds written and security arrangements. Our high-quality surety book was effectively stress-tested in the 2008 financial crisis and performed well, and our underwriting approach has remained disciplined since that time.  I'll take a minute and comment on business interruption coverages under commercial property policies. Let me begin by saying that for every claim, without exception, we start by looking at the facts of the claim and the terms of the policy to determine whether the claim is covered or not. That said, our commercial property insurance policies that include business interruption, including as a result of civil authority, require losses to be caused by direct physical damage to property from a covered cause of loss. In addition, our standard policy form specifically excludes loss or damage caused by/or resulting from a virus. More broadly, the issue of retroactively expanding coverage beyond the original intent of a policy is important for the industry. So let me make a few additional observations. Insurers don't collect premiums to cover losses that policies weren't written to cover, requiring those losses to be covered retroactively on any broad scale would overwhelm the industry's claim staying ability for legitimate claims and fairly leading many individuals and businesses exposed. To that point, the industry's financial strength is especially important in a time of increased natural catastrophes. The spring tornado season is already active, hurricane season is fast approaching, and wildfires represents an ongoing threat.  On top of all of that, contract certainty is a core underpinning of the U.S. free market system and any effort to undermine that has the potential to set a dangerous precedent. Finally, with respect to liability coverages, in the near term, as people shelter in place, we are seeing fewer commercial auto accidents and slip-and-fall type claims. In addition, we are seeing some movement by the plaintiffs' bar to settle claims faster. On the other hand, we expect that the plaintiffs' bar will seek to generate COVID-related litigation.  Let me take a minute to address a related and important policy issue. The trial bar is already actively soliciting plaintiffs for cases related to the pandemic. A number of lawsuits have already been filed, including related to the manufacturing and distribution of hand sanitizer and efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccine. Those aren't our insureds, so I don't have a view on the merits of those cases. But we should all be concerned that many frivolous lawsuits will be brought and will undermine the nation's recovery, including by delaying and adding expense to R&D related to the development and distribution of COVID-19 tests and therapeutics, deterring employers from responsibly bringing employees back to work and retail businesses from responsibly opening to customers and targeting highly vulnerable businesses like those in the health care and travel industries that can't afford the distraction or the expense. On top of these specific concerns, as I'm sure you're aware, the United States has the highest tort tax in the world. According to a recent study by the Institute for Legal Reform, tort costs amount to more than $3,300 per U.S. household and much more than that in some states. Americans shouldn't have to endure that, and they can't afford to at the moment. In other words, our recovery from this crisis would benefit considerably from Commonsense Tort Reform as well as legal liability protection for our health care heroes, firms involved in recovery efforts and all businesses seeking to reopen.  I'll now turn to our first quarter results. This morning, we reported core income of $676 million and core return on equity of 11.5%. As compared to the prior year, the results for the quarter were adversely impacted by a higher level of catastrophe losses and charges related to the pandemic, both of which Dan will address shortly. Our underlying underwriting income in the quarter was higher than the prior year, benefiting from record first quarter net earned premium of $7.2 billion and an underlying combined ratio, which improved to 91.3%, despite $86 million of pretax COVID-19-related charges. Our high-quality investment portfolio performed well, generating net investment income of $519 million after-tax.  Turning to production. We executed successfully on our marketplace strategies and grew net written premium by 4% and more than $7.3 billion. Given the timing of the pandemic, the impact of COVID-19 on production generally wasn't significant for the quarter. Net written premiums and business insurance increased 1%. Domestic renewal premium change was strong at 7.8%, including renewal rate change of 6.2%. Renewal rate change was up again, both sequentially and year-over-year, while retention remained very strong.  In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 13%, with strong growth in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. Renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business was 7.5%, up more than 3 points over the prior year quarter, while retention remained historically high at 89%. In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 8%, with Agency Homeowners up 18% and Agency Auto up 3%, with both lines benefiting from strong production. Across all 3 of our segments, we are pleased with our production results, and we will continue to execute to meet our target returns. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Tom and Michael about our segment results.  I'll close by saying that in this moment of uncertainty, our stakeholders can count on us to continue to operate consistent with our long-term financial strategy as we have for many years and through other challenging periods of uncertainty. We have the talent, technology, risk management processes and procedures, and importantly, the financial strength to manage through these extraordinary times and to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $676 million, down from $755 million in the prior year quarter, and core ROE was 11.5%, down from 13%. The change in both measures from last year's first quarter resulted primarily from a higher level of catastrophe losses compared to a relatively quiet cat quarter last year. First quarter results also include the adverse impact of COVID-19, which I'll provide more color on in a moment.  Our first quarter results include $333 million of pretax cat losses, $140 million higher than last year's first quarter. This quarter's cats include $182 million from the March tornado activity in Nashville. PYD in the current quarter, for which I'll provide more detail shortly, was net favorable $27 million pretax. The underlying combined ratio of 91.3%, which excludes the impacts of cats and PYD, was strong and improved by 0.3 point from the prior year quarter. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $594 million was 11% higher than in the prior year quarter, reflecting the volume benefit from higher levels of earned premium in all three business segments, lower levels of non-catastrophe weather losses and an improved loss ratio in personal insurance auto. These benefits were partially offset by the current quarter impact of increases to loss ratios in the commercial businesses recognized during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019, all of which we discussed in previous calls. And the impacts related to COVID-19, including first quarter loss estimates and increase in the provision for uncollectible receivables and a reduction in our estimate of ultimate audit premiums receivable. The expense ratio of 30% reflects our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency. The first quarter expense ratio includes nearly 0.5 point of elevated bad debt expense related to the impact of COVID-19.  After-tax net investment income increased by 5% from the prior year quarter to $519 million, driven by higher returns in our nonfixed income portfolio. Recorded results for our private equities, hedge funds and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a 1 quarter lag. So the impact of the disruption in global financial markets that occurred in the latter half of the first quarter will impact our second quarter results. While not perfectly correlated, our nonfixed income returns directionally follow the broader equity markets, which were down 15% to 30% during the first quarter. To the extent the broader markets may recover in the second quarter and beyond, our portfolio would then see that benefit in future periods on a lagging basis. In the current environment, providing an outlook on our expectations for fixed income results for the remainder of 2020 comes with more uncertainty than usual.  Having said that, as a result of the recent decline in short-term yields, we expect that fixed income NII will decrease by approximately $20 million after-tax per quarter compared to the corresponding periods of 2019.  Turning to prior year reserve development. In Personal Insurance, both auto and property losses came in better than expected for multiple accident years. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp and commercial property, largely offset by unfavorable results in commercial auto. Each of this quarter's movements are relatively small when compared to the reserve base. Regarding reinsurance, as discussed during our fourth quarter results call, we did renew our property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty for 2020, providing aggregate coverage of $280 million, part of $500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of $1.55 billion. Through March, we had accumulated $414 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention.  Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $628 million were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better-than-target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion, well above our target level. Investment yields increased modestly as credit spreads widened during the first quarter. And accordingly, our net unrealized investment gain decreased from $2.2 billion after-tax as of year-end to $1.8 billion after-tax at March 31. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $92.63 at quarter end, comparable to year-end and up 4% year-over-year. Adjusted book value per share included an adverse impact of $0.97 due to net unrealized losses from -- resulting from foreign currency translation, as the dollar strengthened against most foreign currencies as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. We returned $681 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of $471 million and dividends of $210 million. As noted in the press release, our Board has authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.85 per share. We have increased dividends every year for the past 16 years. Dividend payments provide a reliable stream of income to the millions of individuals who own our shares as part of 401(k)s, other retirement accounts or as part of overall financial planning.  Given the current environment, we thought some additional commentary regarding our overall balance sheet strength and our liquidity position would be appropriate. As we've said for many years, we measure success over time. And as a result, our capital management and investment strategies are designed to withstand the periods of stress that will inevitably arise. To that end, we closed the first quarter with over $100 billion in total assets, including a $77 billion investment portfolio. As illustrated on Page 8 of the webcast presentation, our high-quality portfolio consists of 94% fixed income securities. And of those fixed maturity assets, 98% are investment grade. The fixed income portfolio provides a significant and reliable stream of income for us.  Page 9 of the presentation provides a view of our municipal bond investments. As you can see, that $31 billion portfolio consists of extremely high-quality holdings. Page 10 of the webcast shows our nonmunicipal fixed income holdings in categories of particular interest, given the economic impact of COVID-19. The aggregate of our high-yield holdings in these categories accounts for less than 1% of our fixed income portfolio. Importantly, where we do have holdings in any particular category of $400 million or more, those are investment-grade holdings of high-quality names as detailed in the notes to the right of the graph. Page 11 of the webcast shows the makeup of our nonfixed income portfolio, which represents only 6% of our total investment portfolio. These investments are highly diversified with minimal exposure to those risk categories that are most vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. Our thoughtful dent to capital mix has only $500 million of upcoming debt maturity in November of this year. After that, we have no debt maturing until 2026.  Our cash and short-term investments provide us with substantial readily available liquidity and that's not counting our undrawn $1 billion credit facility or our capital, or our capacity to issue additional commercial paper. We stress-tested our cash flows and liquidity under a variety of scenarios considering this uncertain environment, and we're confident that we are well positioned to continue to meet our obligations to our customers, our distribution partners and our employees and to continue to support our communities. In terms of capital management, our strategy remains unchanged. Thinking about share buybacks in the current uncertain environment, it feels to us like holding on to a little more capital is preferable to holding on to a little less, similar to how we felt in 2008. Accordingly, we may buy back some shares in the coming quarters or we may choose to buy none until there's more clarity on the state of the economy.  Finally, let me take a minute to address outlook. Looking at premium volume for the remainder of the year, we expect to see more significant impacts in the economic contraction on written premium and earned premium. And because earned premium typically lags written premium, we'll continue to feel the effects on an earned basis beyond the end of the year. As Alan said, how much and for how long will depend on the extent and duration of the negative economic impacts related to the pandemic. As you've seen in our 10-Q, we have not provided forward-looking information about pricing levels or underlying underwriting margins, given the increased level of uncertainty in the current environment. As an aside, over the past year or so, we have discussed with a number of our shareholders whether there are other more constructive ways to provide our qualitative and directional views of the business going forward as compared to the form in which we have given it historically.  Once the current uncertainty subsides, we will consider whether and how to share our perspectives going forward. Let me sum up what you've heard across Alan's comments and mine to give you some texture as you think about our second quarter. We expect downward pressure on both written and earned premiums, and there will be downward pressure on net investment income. We expect both of these impacts to be pronounced in the second quarter. There will likely be an increase in the expense ratio due to the premium decline. We did not have clarity on the underlying combined ratio due to uncertainty around variations in frequency and severity for each product line. And keep in mind that the second quarter is historically our highest cat quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. I'll start by echoing Alan's statement expressing our deep appreciation for the efforts of the essential workers who're trying to protect and support individuals and businesses during these trying times. I would also like to acknowledge and thank all my colleagues for their exceptional work. We couldn't be more pleased with the commitment and collaboration we have witnessed among our field organization and distribution partners to continue to deliver the exceptional support our business owner customers have come to expect.  While we have many examples, one that I'm proud to highlight is our risk control organization's ability to continue to support new business opportunities, while not always being able to perform on-site assessments. Through the combination of third-party data and remote-enabled technology, we've increased our virtual risk assessments by more than 4.5x from pre-COVID levels. These virtual capabilities have allowed us to continue to support our agents and brokers, while not compromising our risk selection.  On to results for the first quarter. Business Insurance produced segment income of $289 million and a combined ratio of 102.2%, both unfavorable to the prior year quarter primarily due to higher catastrophe losses and from the impact of COVID-19. The combined ratio included a 5-point impact from catastrophes, which was higher than we had seen for the quarter, driven particularly by tornado and hail losses from cat 16, which had a heavy mix of commercial losses for us in Nashville, Tennessee. The underlying combined ratio of 97.3% was 2.3 points higher than the prior year quarter, driven by approximately 2 points related to the coronavirus and related economic impacts. Of this amount, about 1.5 point affects the loss ratio and about 0.5 point affects the expense ratio.  Turning to the top line. Net written premiums were up 1% over the prior year quarter. This is a lower growth rate than what we've seen over the past few quarters with a couple of factors contributing. First, it is a lower level of new business, which I'll touch on in a few moments when I discuss production. In addition, international written premiums were down 8%, driven by Lloyd's, primarily as a result of continued profit improvement initiatives. Lastly, audit premium, although still positive, was lower as compared to last year. While we will always remain active in the marketplace, premium levels will be an outcome of disciplined underwriting and risk selection as we pursue appropriate financial returns across the portfolio.  Turning to domestic production. We achieved strong renewal premium change of 7.8%, including renewal rate change of 6.2%, while retention remained high at 84%. The renewal rate change of 6.2% was up more than 1 point from the fourth quarter of 2019 and more than 4 points from the first quarter of 2019, notwithstanding the persistent downward pressure in workers' compensation pricing. As part of our efforts to achieve target returns, we continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines outside of workers' comp were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to both the fourth quarter and first quarters of last year. In addition, we achieved positive rate at about 3/4 of our middle market accounts this quarter, which was up from about 2/3 in the same quarter of last year. Importantly, we've achieved this progress while retention has remained strong. Our rate strategy is to continue to be thoughtful and execute on a local and granular manner.  You may have noticed in our webcast presentation that RPC for prior quarters was adjusted down by as much a point or 2, driven by the exposure component. Reestimating our production statistics is normal course for us as consumer activity and/or changes in economic factors and form our estimates of whole demand exposure change. So while our process was unchanged, the impact was more meaningful than normal this quarter, given the significant economic effects of COVID-19 on our customers' operations. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was 5.8%, including renewal rate change of 1.6%, which was up 1 point from the first quarter of last year. Retention was relatively consistent at 81%. New business of $120 million was down 6% from the prior year, driven primarily by lower workers' comp pricing.  In middle market, renewal premium change was 7.5%, with renewal rate change of 6.6%, each measure up significantly from both the fourth quarter and first quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 86%. New business of $283 million was down from the prior year quarter, which we attribute largely to our disciplined underwriting and pricing. We're very comfortable with our execution, and we continue to invest in our strategic capabilities and are confident that we're well positioned to profitably grow over time.  To sum up, this is certainly an unprecedented market environment we're operating in. We believe our meaningful competitive advantages, including our strong distribution relationships and our talent and expertise, position us well to navigate through these uncertain times and continue to serve our customers and agent and broker partners.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Echoing the earlier comments, I would be remiss if I did not take the opportunity to thank all of those including medical professionals, first responders and all essential workers who, more than anyone, are making it possible for us to continue to serve our customers, agents and communities. A special thanks also to our agents and my Travelers colleagues who have been unrelentingly dedicated throughout the pandemic quarantine.  Turning to the quarter, Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of very strong returns and growth. Segment income was $122 million, a decrease of $16 million from the prior year quarter. The combined and underlying combined ratios remained very strong. The underlying combined ratio of 85.7% increased 4.6 points from the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by the impact of higher loss estimates for management liability coverages, primarily the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions.  Turning to the top line. Net written premiums were up 13% for the quarter, reflecting growth across all our businesses. In our domestic management liability business, we're pleased that pricing again improved for the third consecutive quarter to a strong 7.5%, while retention remained at a historically high 89%. These production results demonstrate the strong execution of our strategy to improve margins while maintaining strong retention of our high quality portfolio. We will continue to pursue price increases where warranted. Domestic management liability new business for the quarter increased 5% to $58 million. Our domestic surety business posted very strong growth in the quarter, driven by a mix of larger bonded projects as well as a modest increase in construction activity.  International also posted very strong growth and significantly improved pricing in the quarter, driven by our U.K. management liability business. So Bond & Specialty results remained strong in the quarter. And while there is clearly the potential for elevated loss activity in certain Bond & Specialty lines and the depth and duration of the associated economic disruption are unknown, we continue to feel great about the disciplined risk management and underwriting integrity that shaped our portfolios, our ongoing strong field execution and our strategic investments in market-leading products and services, and we feel we are well positioned to navigate through this challenging environment and continue to deliver strong returns over time.  And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Personal Insurance began 2020 with strong profitability and production. Segment income was $336 million, up 21% compared to the first quarter of 2019. Our combined ratio of 88.2% improved by approximately 2 points, driven by better underlying underwriting results, partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher catastrophe losses. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was 84%, an improvement of 5 points compared to a strong prior year quarter, with excellent results in both home and auto.  The net impact from COVID-19 on segment income was not significant in the quarter. Increases in the allowance for credit losses on premium receivables and higher loss estimates in homeowners and other, primarily from special event coverages for vetting, were offset by favorable impacts on auto loss experience that we began to see in the latter portion of March.  Turning to the top line. Net written premium grew 8%, driven by strong growth in domestic results, especially in homeowners. International net written premiums were down 5%, primarily as a result of continued auto profit improvement actions in Canada. Agency Automobile delivered another impressive quarter, with a combined ratio of 89.4%, consistent with the prior year quarter. Underlying results improved relative to the prior year quarter, while favorable net prior year reserve development was lower than last year. The underlying combined ratio of 89.2% improved 2.9 points relative to the prior year quarter, continuing to reflect improvements in frequency levels. Roughly half of the improvement reflects the continuation of the lower claim frequency levels we had already been observing, while the other half is associated with a decrease in miles driven as a result of COVID-19 and related economic conditions. To add some texture to the impacts of COVID-19, data from our telematics program, which we call IntelliDrive, indicates a fairly rapid decline in miles driven per day during the latter part of March, resulting in an average decrease of more than 40% in miles driven for the second half of the month. As a result, auto claim frequency dropped well below our expectations. Based in part on that data and an expectation that favorable frequency trends will continue in the near term, we recently announced the Travelers stay-at-home auto premium credit program. The program provides U.S. personal auto insurance customers with a 15% credit on April and May auto premiums. The premium credits to customers are estimated to total $140 million for the 2 months and are expected to be recorded as a reduction in premium in the second quarter. The first quarter results in Agency Homeowners & Other were very strong as our combined ratio improved by 4 points from the prior year quarter to 84.2% despite higher catastrophes and net prior year reserve development that, while favorable, was lower than the prior year quarter.  On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was 74.9%, an improvement of almost 8 points versus the prior year quarter, driven by lower non-catastrophe weather. The quarter benefited from unusually mild winter weather, leading especially to lower freeze-related claims.  Turning to production. Agency Automobile net written premiums grew 3%, with 10% growth in new business, while retention remained strong at 84% and renewal premium change was 2.4%. Agency Homeowners & Other delivered a very strong quarter, with net written premium growth of 18%. New business was up 30% from the prior year quarter. Retention remained strong at 86% and renewal premium change increased for the fifth consecutive quarter to 7.7%. Higher new business levels again benefited from the successful rollout of our Quantum Home 2.0 product. Now available in 37 markets, Quantum Home 2's granular pricing segmentation, customizable coverages and ease of quoting combined to form a solution that is both sophisticated and simple and our increased quote volume and higher average premiums suggest it continues to hit the mark with both agents and customers.  Before I conclude, I'd like to highlight a few examples of how our investments and capabilities are paying dividends for us, our agents and our customers in this challenging environment. First, our digital claim capabilities are supporting our ability to respond to customers in their time of need, while keeping them and our employees safe. From the end of February to the first week in April, the use of virtual inspection and damage measurement for auto claims and the use of live video inspection for property interior claims more than doubled. Second, the take-up rate in our auto telematics program IntelliDrive is on the rise as consumers show increased interest in products that determine premiums based on driving behavior.  And finally, the digital tools we've invested in to support our agents and brokers are in high demand. Their usage of our digital marketing campaigns, including a handful of new ones developed specifically in response to COVID-19 has increased more than 50%. To recap, we're thankful in Personal Insurance to have had a great start to the year. We're also grateful for the support that essential workers, first responders and health care workers are providing to us and our communities in this challenging environment. In these unprecedented times, I'm particularly proud of the way our team has responded to our customers and distribution partners, while also taking care of themselves, their loved ones and one another. While there will be further challenges ahead, our team's efforts continue to position us well to meet the needs of those we're privileged to serve and to continue to grow profitably while investing in the business for the future.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael. We're ready to take questions now. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Phillips: I think my question is probably for Greg. Look, we see -- if you ex out the COVID, your BI margin was relatively flat in the quarter. Your rates -- renewal rate was still up and accelerated. I guess given -- and we hear you what's happening clearly with exposures in the near term. But I guess, how do you think about how the margin should play out in the near term? I guess specifically, I'm thinking, what are your thoughts on continued ability to push for rate in the near term on your commercial lines business?\nAlan Schnitzer: Michael, so let me actually start. And if Greg has got anything to add, we'll turn it over to him. So I think for all the reasons that simply all of this have expressed in one form or another, the outlook for margin is uncertain. And I agree with you. Margin for first quarter were actually quite good. From a pricing perspective, I can tell you that we will continue to execute to meet our objectives. And on many lines, that means we will continue to get rate. Now there will be some conversation about what customers can tolerate in times like this. But I can tell you that customers may benefit as exposure declines lead to premium declines. But on those accounts where we need to improve returns, we wouldn't expect premiums to decline as much as exposure will decline. So in that environment, that would lead to an improved price per unit, if you will. So we will continue to execute to meet our target returns. And obviously, we'll see what happens. But we're coming off a pretty good trend. And for all the reasons that are probably apparent, there are a lot of lines out there that continue to need margin improvement.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. I guess let me -- my second question will be more specifically on your commercial auto book. And you did talk on -- there at the -- on personal auto, you see frequency down in the back half of March, about 40% or so. How does that look for your commercial auto book? Any differences relatively kind of personal auto on frequency declines and how that looks?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Michael, this is Greg. Yes, we're obviously watching and monitoring the trends, and it's really early in terms of watching the frequency on the commercial auto book. But Michael and my team and the group of actuaries are spending a lot of time at a geographic level, at a business unit level and calibrating where the frequency is. But it's just too early to really comment on what the frequency would look like for commercial auto at this point.\nAlan Schnitzer: But we would say, Mike, that it's been down. And I think I shared that in my prepared remarks that it has been done with the exact relationship will be relative to personal auto. That we'll have to see how it plays out.\nMichael Klein: And Michael, this is Michael Klein. I just wanted to clarify the comment in my prepared remarks was actually about miles driven being down more than 40%, not a frequency number. Certainly, they're correlated, but I just wanted to clarify that the comments were about miles driven.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski: In the prepared remarks, you talked about certain states for workers' comp instituting presumptions of compensability. Could you elaborate? Is this something that Travelers and the industry is accepting? Or is this -- could play out similar to business interruption insurance or certain of these changes could kind of play out in the courts? And I just -- is this expected to negatively impact margins per comp in the near term? And then you -- I think, Alan, you alluded to pricing changing eventually to account for these changes? Any clarity would help.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. So I would say, broadly speaking, the answer to your question is it's early, and this is still developing. There are some number of states that have adopted some type of presumption. In many cases, that applies to health care workers and first responders where who might have expected in any event that there would be compensability. In other states, either they have or are talking about extending the scope of the -- essentially compensability to other workers. And so in effect, that would shift the burden of proof to who's got to prove the way the disease was contracted. In terms of exactly how it's going to play out, I think we'll have to see. In some states, the business communities that are thinking about what that's going to do to their premiums are engaging in the debate along with other interested parties. But exactly how it's going to play out, I don't know. I mean if it were to move against us, we would expect that there would be an impact on margins in -- over the near term. And then obviously, that will work its way into rate making over time.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Great. And lastly, in terms of the surety line, which you guys could provide some helpful color on, could you explain how the force majeure will help out? And is this the main line within the bond and surety segment that you expect to potentially be most impacted? Or are there -- or is it more the management liability side or both?\nThomas Kunkel: So thanks, it's Tom. I would say that when you look at the surety lines, construction surety is about 2% of the revenue and commercial surety is about 1/3 of the revenue. So we're going to focus on that bigger piece of construction surety, you asked about force majeure. So we have force majeure clauses, government action clauses, suspension of work clauses. And as a generality, as Alan pointed out in his comments, we think they're going to provide time relief in the event that contractors are delayed. That will be handled on a contract-by-contract basis. But I think the important thing when you look at the construction surety line, is that it's been termed in many, many and even most states to be an essential business. And as such, it's our sense, and again, as Alan pointed out, I think, that the vast majority of contractors are still working. And so if that's the case, you would look at that construction surety business, and you would say that's a healthy sign. And so I think when we consider the surety lines, the other thing is you're going to see just a big difference amongst different carriers. So it's going to depend on how they underwrote their book the last 3 to 5 years and the depth and duration of any slowdown. So I hope that answered your question.\nAlan Schnitzer: Tom, I think you said 2% construction surety, I think you meant 2/3.\nThomas Kunkel: I'm sorry, I did mean 2/3. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Bobman with Capital Returns.\nRonald Bobman: And I echo your comments for everyone's well-being. And I never thought I'd look so forward to driving to Windsor to revisit your claims facility at some point in time.\nAlan Schnitzer: We look forward to having you.\nRonald Bobman: I have two questions. In the premium credit area, sort of the relief that you're providing to auto -- personal auto customers, how are you handling agents commissions on the relief? It was my first question, and I've got an unrelated second question.\nMichael Klein: Sure. The answer to the question on commissions, this is Michael, is there is no impact to base commissions from the premium relief. So the agent gets paid the full commission on the policy.\nRonald Bobman: And my other question was I made -- I took note of Alan, you're specifying the virus exclusion, and I greatly appreciate that. I just wanted to ask, in the very, very small segment, Simply Business that I think some portion of their volume is written using Travelers paper. Does that virus exclusion have an explicit place there as well?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. We don't actually have a property product on the Simply Business platform. So that wouldn't come into play there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Auto Research.\nRyan Tunis: First one just on business interruption for Alan. First, I just wanted to confirm that there's not a substantial subset or any subset of your policies that don't have the virus exclusion?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Ryan. When you've got a portfolio, the size of ours, we're certainly going to find a pocket here or there that doesn't have that specific exclusion. But I can tell you that, subject to some legislative action that we think would be subject to a constitutional challenge. We really do not think we have a material exposure from business interruption.\nRyan Tunis: And for property in the international book, there's no difference of the wording issue there?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, that's a really good question. There's definitely a difference of the way the wording and the product works outside the United States. I'm not a coverage expert and definitely not the right one to explain the nuances to you. But I can tell you if we get to the same conclusion outside the United States as we do inside the United States, we just do not think we've got a material exposure to business interruption.\nRyan Tunis: Okay. And then my follow-up was just on the workers' comp and the discussion around, I guess, essential employees. You said you don't have much exposure to the frontline workers or health care. I'm curious if you can maybe quantify that a bit. But then thinking about I guess, other subsets that have been deemed essential that aren't necessarily health care first responders. You start thinking about utility workers, food. Any help, I guess, you could give us there on the size of that book in the context of what you're writing?\nAlan Schnitzer: There's nothing we could really quantify for you. I can tell you, as it relates to health care and first responders from a premium perspective, it's a pretty small percentage of the workers' comp premiums that we have. Then once you start getting outside of that, every state defines essential a little bit different and so it's -- we are -- we will definitely have exposure to essential workers. Then you get into questions of, okay, so what are the infection rates going to be? What are the health care costs, et cetera, et cetera? But there's really nothing -- there's really no number we can give you on an aggregate basis, I think that we have enough confidence to give you or that we think would be helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Alan, I think you've talked about the business interruption pretty well, but just one other, just quick clarification. Do you all provide a virus endorsement to customers at all? And if so, what percentage of your policies would you provide that endorsement?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. So this is across Travelers basis, there are a few number of policies that do have an affirmative virus grant and losses for that would be included in our results for this quarter. So we would have contemplated that in the charge that we took.\nBrian Meredith: Excellent. Great. That's really, really helpful. And then second question, I'm just curious. Do you all -- and this is for Tom, do you all participate at all in the energy surety market? And if so, what are your expectations there?\nThomas Kunkel: Well, in our commercial surety business, we do have a modest participation in the surety business. There you see lots of different parts of that market from upstream to mid-stream, the downstream, the service providers, we have some parts of that market that over the years, we have liked better than others. However, I think our approach to the energy market has always been somewhat cautious and while we certainly do have a modest exposure there, we're not out weight in any way, shape or form.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: So if I take $86 million that you guys called out for COVID in the quarter, and that's around 1.2 points on your combined ratio. And so I guess my question is, that was for 1 month, right, or about 1 month for March. Is the right way to think about it? And I understand you guys don't want to go down the front of giving full guidance. Is the right way to think about it that we would make that -- take that for the full quarter and some kind of math of times 3 or some assumption of how long you think the COVID impact will last within the industry?\nDaniel Frey: Elyse, it's Dan Frey. I'll try to take that. I think that would be very difficult to do for a couple of reasons. One is part of the charge, as we explained in my commentary, relates to bad debt provision for billing relief and billing relief, we expect to occur for a finite period of time. That's going to be based on what we've already announced voluntarily and in some cases, what states are asking us to do. But right now, that's pretty boxed. And so we think that we would have most of that inside what we've seen so far. So far, I'd say there could be more of that in the second quarter, but I certainly wouldn't take that number times 12. Unless, of course, this becomes a prolonged and deep situation in which that situation has to continue on a go-forward basis.  I think, similarly, some of the losses that we've talked about, as Tom just talked about, we tried to make -- as Alan just talked about, sorry, we try to make an assessment of where we think we do have some potential exposure outside the U.S. and try to be fully responsive in that regard. So it would be -- I think too early to, one, to make a conclusion. And two, I would counsel, I think, against that approach.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question on, in the 10-Q, you guys had called out some prior year adjustments within Business Insurance, I believe, for the fourth quarter of last year. Is it possible to quantify that? And what lines that stem from? It seems like it was offset by other kind of development pushes and pulls.\nDaniel Frey: I'm not sure what the question is, Elyse. Could you give me some help on specifically what you're talking about?\nElyse Greenspan: I thought I saw a comment in the 10-Q in relation to Business Insurance, where you guys had called out some adverse development for the -- later in the 2019 accident year. Was there any kind of true-ups or adverse development taken on some of the longer tail lines, whether commercial auto or general liability related to accident year 2019 within just Business Insurance?\nDaniel Frey: Yes. So if it's in the commentary in the MD&A around the change in the underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance, we do have the impact of the changes in the liability lines that we reported in the second, third and fourth quarters of last year and disclosed in last year's quarter. Now when you look at those, they carry forward and have an impact on the first quarter of this year. It was not included in the first quarter of last year. So that's the delta we're trying to explain there.\nAlan Schnitzer: But Elyse, if you're -- you may be asking about prior year development. I think that's what you said. But Elyse, maybe we can take this off-line. I think we're a little confused about the question.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question coming from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJamminder Bhullar: So I had a question first just on workers' comp again. Can you talk -- you mentioned your views on business interruption, just your views on the legality of claims in some cases. But can you talk about submission activity for the line? And how many claims you're seeing filed versus what you'd normally see file in a normal quarter, just to get an idea on how much litigation there could be in this line.\nAlan Schnitzer: When you say submission, you mean claim submissions? Is that what you're talking about?\nJamminder Bhullar: Yes. Yes. Yes. So whether or not the...\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Broadly speaking, workers' compensation claim frequency would be down. Our -- I probably wouldn't want to quantify that because I'm not sure we'd want to say what we've seen in a couple of weeks is necessarily going to translate to what we're going to see for a full quarter. But across many of our lines of business, we've seen frequency -- claim frequency down. I'm not sure that necessarily translates into litigation risk, however, if that's the point that you're trying to make.\nJamminder Bhullar: Sorry, on business interruption, I might have said workers' comp, but business interruption.\nAlan Schnitzer: Business interruption, I'm sorry. There's definitely been some claim activity, the -- and essentially everyone, where I'd say the vast majority of them, we declined it because we've got the exclusion or other provisions that apply. So I don't -- I actually don't even know what the precise number is. But the vast majority, we declined the claim consistent with the policy terms.\nJamminder Bhullar: And then how does your reinsurance cost coverage work in the sense that if you are -- if you end up losing some cases in court on business interruption, is your reinsurance plan going to cover you regardless of whether you have losses or not? Or the language is such that your primary losses or losses on the primary side will not be covered by reinsurance because those contracts have specific virus clauses as well?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. It's always a mistake, I think, to give claim advice on either side of the insurance policy without specific facts and circumstances and looking at the policy language. But to be responsive to your question, I will say that follow-the-fortunes doctrine is alive and well and reflected in our reinsurance treaties generally. That being said, if there is legislative action that essentially overturns contract certainty, and we end up in constitutional challenges, et cetera, then we're in a new world, and I'm not sure what happens to reinsurance in that situation.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Abbe for closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much for joining us this morning. And for those left in the queue and anyone else that has questions, of course, as always, please feel free to follow-up with Investor Relations. Be well and thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."}], "2022": [{"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 4, "year": 2021, "date": "2022-01-20 14:44:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being on January 20, 2022. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter 2021 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our Greek segment President, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klink of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the quarter and full year, we are very pleased to report excellent bottom line results as well as successful top line growth. We attribute these results to our strong franchise value and excellent execution day in and day out in every aspect of our business. At the same time, we're forcing ahead on strategic initiatives designed to position Travelers for continued success. Core income for the quarter was $1.3 billion or $5.20 per diluted share generating quarter turn on equity of 19.8%. These results benefited from strong underlying underwriting income, driven by record net earned premiums of $8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 88.7%. That brings full year core income to $3.5 billion or $13.94 per diluted share and full year core return on equity to 13.7%. Our full year core income includes record underlying underwriting profit, $2.9 billion pretax. Catastrophe losses that were once again favorable compared to our market share, more than $0.5 billion of favorable pretax prior year reserve development and outstanding investment returns. In short, we're firing on all cylinders. We are particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses, where we are seeing the margin expansion we anticipated. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved by almost 4 points year-over-year in business insurance and almost 2 points in Bond & Specialty Insurance. Looking at the two commercial segments together, the combined BI, BSI underlying combined ratio was 90.4% for 2021, a significant improvement from 94.1% in the prior year. Underlying results in Personal Insurance were impacted by other loss frequency recurring to more normal levels as miles driven has increased and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in both auto and property. Nonetheless, with a 96.5% all-in combined ratio, PI results for the year were solid. Our consolidated results demonstrate the value of our diversified group of businesses. Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $624 million after tax for the quarter and $2.5 billion for the year, reflecting reliable results from our fixed income portfolio and another quarter of terrific returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our very strong operating results, together with our solid balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 10% during the year. After making important investments in our business and returning $3.1 billion of excess capital to shareholders including $2.2 billion of share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $801 million of our stock. Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 10% to $8 billion. Each of our three segments again contributed meaningfully to the top line growth. In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 9% with renewal premium change of 9.2%, near an all-time high. At the same time, retention was higher. As we've shared before, strong retention is an important indicator of continued stability in the marketplace. New business levels were up 16%. Renewal rate change in business insurance was down about one point sequentially. Exposure growth was about 4.5 points, continuing an improving trend and reaching its highest level in 15 years. That's a very encouraging sign, both in terms of economic activity and its contribution to written margin expansion. Excluding the workers' comp product line, renewal rate change in BI for the quarter was nearly 7% and historically strong result. Rate in workers' comp was a little more negative than we've seen over the past year, which is consistent with the strong profitability of the line. Overall renewal premium change to no workers' comp line was positive as exposure growth was meaningfully positive about as high as we've seen in a few years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings rose at a nearly 6% annualized rate over the past six months, up from about between 0.5% in the first six months of the year. Wage inflation is a benefit in terms of margin contribution. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 13%, driven by strong renewal premium change of 10.9% in our management liability business, and continued strong retention. In both of our commercial business segments, written margins continue to expand as written pricing outpaces estimated loss trend and we expect that to continue for a while. In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 10%. Renewal premium change in auto improved by more than 1 point. Renewal premium change in homeowners remained strong at 8.7%. Policies in force in both auto and homeowners increased to record levels. The innovation and technology investments we've been making over the past number of years have had a meaningful impact on our 2021 results, and we're confident that ongoing and planned initiatives will continue to drive successful top and bottom line results going forward. Our scale, profitability and cash flow support our ability to invest well over $1 billion annually on technology. By way of example, we're digitizing the value chain leveraging cloud technology, leaning into artificial intelligence for everything from simple automation to deep learning, tapping into new data sources and building increasingly accurate predictive models. With meaningful opportunities to transform the way business is done, scale is going to be an increasingly important differentiator. Through our focus on optimizing productivity and efficiency, we have been able to meaningfully increase our overall technology spend over the last five years, while at the same time, significantly reducing our expense ratio. Importantly, over that period, we have improved the mix of our technology spend. We have increased our spending on strategic technology initiatives by 50% while reducing routine but necessary expenditures. In 2021, our leading claim organization completed a strategic three-year plan we call Right Touch. That effort resulted in more than $125 million of annual run rate savings, which is reflected in our results. In addition to creating efficiencies for us, investments in digital capabilities over the past few years have enabled us to improve the customer experience. Our timing was good. Pre-pandemic, we anticipated a higher rate of digital adoption. And when the pandemic accelerated the trend we were prepared to meet the need. We are now using virtual claim handling capabilities on a significant majority of both auto appraisals and wind tail claims without the need for inspection by a travelers claim professional. We are also handling significantly more water claims virtually as compared to pre-pandemic levels. In other words, we're delivering great experiences for our customers and a more efficient outcome for our shareholders. Throughout Travelers, we see a lot of benefit and opportunity from artificial intelligence. We've shared in recent quarters the success we've had in deploying aerial imagery coupled with proprietary deep machine learning to accelerate damage assessment and claim resolution in the wake of catastrophes. In the recent Colorado wildfire, we were able to serve some customers before they even had a chance to return to their homes. In severe wind events, our latest model can identify the extent of exterior property damage with a high degree of accuracy. These are some of the capabilities we use to meet our objective closing 90% of all claims to rising out of catastrophe events within 30 days and exclusively with Travelers claim professionals instead of also relying on independent adjusters. Resolving claims quickly and to Travelers employees, again, it's about delivering great experiences for our customers and a more efficient outcome for our shareholders. Other initiatives across the Company leverage technology, data and models to support decision-making. We have more than 60 million data records related to businesses, individuals and distributors, including virtually every business in the U.S. These records are curated into well-designed proprietary data products. We leverage this with more than 2,000 external data sets including high-resolution aerial imagery covering substantially all property exposures in the United States. All of this data fuels our more than 1,000 advanced analytical models. Our models support risk selection and segmentation, pricing, reserving, claim response and more. Our tech data and analytics advantage is significant and hard to replicate. We deployed these capabilities across the value chain from customer acquisition to underwriting to claim handlers. For example, understanding the size, condition and geometry of a roof can be significant to segmenting risk. Most homeowners understandably wouldn't note that had a hip roof or a gable group level one sizer condition. So it's hard to get accurate information due to the application process. We've developed and trained AI to evaluate those roofing characteristics using aerial imagery and are integrating that intelligence into our underwriting segmentation and pricing. Powering all of this is our exceptional workforce. We start with world-class expertise in traditional insurance-related disciplines and enhance that with leading computer data and industrial engineers, design professionals, geophysicists, behavioral scientists AI experts, professionals and so on. It takes all 30,000 of our Travelers colleagues to deliver the financial performance and strategic achievements we're reporting today, and I'm grateful to them all. To sum it up, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and the year with cutting-edge expertise and risk and risk management, complemented by the strength we've built digital excellence and innovation. We are well positioned to identify and execute on the most promising opportunities in our industry. By extending our advantage in risk expertise, delivering industry-leading experiences and continuing to improve productivity and efficiency, we will continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was a terrific $1.289 billion, which brings the full year results to $3.522 billion. For the quarter, core return on equity was 19.8% and for the full year, core ROE was 13.7%. Our strong and consistent performance has resulted in double-digit core ROE in 9 of the past 10 years, averaging 12.6% over that time frame. We have consistently delivered a meaningful margin over both 10-year treasury and our cost of capital, and we've done so with industry low volatility. Underlying underwriting income was a very strong $867 million pretax, reflecting increased levels of earned premium in all three segments and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 88.7%. As was the case in the third quarter, improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty results both reflected the benefit of earned price that continues to exceed loss trends. The higher underlying combined ratio in personal insurance resulted from the comparison to unusually low auto losses related to the pandemic in last year's quarter as well as higher severity in this year's quarter. Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes. The fourth quarter expense ratio improved in all three segments and the consolidated expense ratio of 28.5% for the quarter brings the full year expense ratio to a historically low 29.4%. Even as we make significant investments in initiatives that we believe will drive our continued success, our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency drove a 50 basis point improvement in this share's expense ratio, which is now more than 200 basis points lower than it was just five years ago. As we continue to grow the business and maintain our focus on productivity and efficiency, we expect to remain in this mid-29% range in the near term and then gradually move down to around 29% over the next couple of years. Of course, there will be variability in any given quarter, but on a full year basis, that is the path we're on. Our fourth quarter cat losses were $36 million pretax. In this year's fourth quarter, we recognized recoveries of $255 million from the Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty. A $221 million benefit for the quarter's cat losses and a $34 million benefit to underlying losses. The cat benefits by segment was $109 million in Business Insurance, $108 million in Personal Insurance and the remainder in Bond & Specialty Insurance. The underlying benefit by segment was $10 million in Business Insurance and $24 million in Personal Insurance. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had net favorable development of $95 million pretax on a consolidated basis. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $74 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple exiting years. The Bond & Specialty segment saw a net favorable development of $24 million, while in Personal Insurance, modest favorable PYD in homeowners and other was offset by modest unfavorable development in auto, with the net result to PI being $3 million unfavorable. After-tax net investment income of $624 million reflected another quarter of very strong returns in the non-fixed income portfolio and fixed income results that were modestly better than our expectations. Looking forward to 2022, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $430 million and $440 million per quarter, modestly higher than in 2021 as the benefit of expected growth in invested assets will be partially offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio given the continued low interest rate environment. Although interest rates have moved up somewhat recently, we still expect that new purchase yields will be lower than the yields on the bonds rang off. Page 20 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 cat treaty renewals. Our long-standing corporate cat XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events. While the treaty renewed on terms that were generally in line with the expiring treaty providing coverage for the $2 billion layer above the unchanged $3 billion retention, we increased our coverage in the $2 billion layer from 75% to 90% thus increasing the amount of coverage available from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. The 2022 renewal of the underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty resulted in placing 45% of the coverage layer. The treaty provides aggregate coverage of $225 million for the $500 million of losses above our aggregate retention of $2 billion. The per event deductible has increased from $5 million in 2021 to $10 million for 2022. Hurricane, wildfire and earthquake events once again have a $250 million per occurrence cap. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.7 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. For the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $7 billion for our strongest year ever reflecting the benefit of continued increases in premium volume, strong profitability and lower-than-normal overall claim payouts as courtroom and other settlement activity remained below historical levels. As we've said previously, we are assuming that this lower level of payment activity is ultimately a timing issue. When establishing our reserves and when pricing our products, we assume that elevated severity related to social inflation has not abated at all. Our substantial cash flow gives us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio, which increased to $87 billion at year-end 2021. We've added an impressive $15 billion or more than 20% to our investment portfolio in just the past three years. Interest rates increased modestly during the fourth quarter, and accordingly, our net unrealized investment gain decreased from $2.7 billion after tax as of September 30 to $2.4 billion after tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $109.76 at year-end, a healthy 10% increase from a year ago. We returned more than $1 billion of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $216 million and share repurchases of $801 million. For the year, we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.2 billion of share repurchases. Overall, we had an excellent year with accelerating top line growth, strong and improved margins in our commercial businesses and improved expense ratio and a balance sheet that positions us very well for the future. And now, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding out a terrific year with respect to financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. Segment income for the quarter was $867 million, up more than $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2020 driven primarily by higher underlying underwriting income and net investment income. We're once again particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 89.8%, which improved by 3.8 points from the fourth quarter of 2020. A little more than 1.5 points of the improvement was from earned pricing that continued to exceed the loss cost trends. Another 0.5 point came from the improvement in the expense ratio. The remaining approximately 1.5 points resulted from a combination of a lower level of property losses than we expected and a favorable impact associated with the pandemic. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 9% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from strong renewal premium change high retention and an increase in new business levels. We're very pleased with these outstanding financial results for the quarter and more broadly for the full year. Before turning to production, let me provide a little color on the full year results to put the quarter in context. The top line of $16.1 billion was an all-time high. Segment income was $2.4 billion and the underlying combined ratio of 91.7% were both excellent. These results were driven by the successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies, and we're well positioned for continued profitable growth. Turning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.2%, while retention remained exceptional at 85%. New business of $505 million was up 16% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by our success with large accounts in middle market. The 9.2% renewal premium change was up one point from the fourth quarter of last year, with renewal rate change of 5.2% and continued improvement in exposure growth to levels we haven't seen in more than a decade. The 5.2% renewal rate was down a bit sequentially, similar to the trends we saw in the first three quarters. The rate gains we achieved reflect our deliberate execution given the significant improvements in profitability across the portfolio after several years of meaningful rate increases and improvements in terms and conditions. Written pricing, including the portion of exposure that behaves like rate remains in excess of loss trend. So all other things equal, margins will continue to improve as this price earns in. Given social and other inflation, the frequency and severity of weather-related loss activity and the persisting low interest rate environment, we will continue to see pricing gains to further improve the profitability of our business. As always, our execution in terms of rate and retention will be granular at the account or class level. In addition to our granular price execution, we also remain focused on careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sublimits and exclusions, which also contribute to an increase in the price per unit of rest. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was a strong 9.4% while retention was 82%. New business was up 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by the continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 44 states. As a reminder, BOP 2.0 is our completely redesigned state-of-the-art product which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience. Looking back on the year for Select, we're pleased with the progress we've made in improving the profitability of this business while continuing to invest for future growth. In middle market, renewal premium change remained strong at 8.8%, while retention was once again historically high at 87%. New business was up 25% from the prior year quarter, driven predominantly by our success with large accounts, as I mentioned earlier. To sum up, Business Insurance had a great fourth quarter and full year. We continue to improve the profitability of the book while investing in digital assets, analytics and industry-leading expertise to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty ended a strong year with another terrific quarter. Segment income was $170 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher underlying underwriting income. The underlying combined ratio of 83.3% improved by 1.7 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting or pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and a lower expense ratio. Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew a very strong 13% in the quarter with contributions from all our businesses. In domestic management liability, we achieved double-digit renewal premium change for the fifth consecutive quarter at a level of just modestly below our record high third quarter. Retention was higher sequentially and remained strong despite the impact of our strategy to non-renewed cyber accounts that do not meet our minimum cyber hygiene protocols. Early indications are that those underwriting actions are having a meaningful favorable impact on the frequency of cyber claims we're seeing. Domestic surety posted solid growth in the fourth quarter reflecting our market-leading position and continued investments in providing meaningful value-added products and services to our customers. Our international businesses again posted excellent growth, reflecting strong management liability, retention and rate. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, capping off a great year and demonstrating the strong value proposition we offer to our customers and distribution partners and excellent execution across our businesses. And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance for the fourth quarter, segment income was $327 million, and our combined ratio was 91.1%, both solid results in the context of a challenging environment. We were pleased that our top line momentum continued in the quarter with net written premium up 10%. In automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 104.1%, an increase of 18 points compared to the prior year quarter, which reflected unusually low loss activity due to the pandemic. Automobile loss levels increased mainly due to miles driven and claim frequency effectively returning to pre-pandemic levels and to a lesser extent, higher loss severity as vehicle replacement and repair costs remained elevated. These profitability challenges are environmental, and we anticipate that they will persist into 2022. In response, we began implementing rate increases. Rate increases have taken effect in 11 states since August. We anticipate additional increases in approximately 25 states throughout the first quarter, with more actions planned in subsequent quarters. As we indicated last quarter, although it will take time for these rate actions to earn into our results, we remain confident we are on track to address the near-term profit challenges and continue to profitably grow our book over time. In Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio improved by 4 points from the prior year quarter to 77.8% despite the fact that we continue to see higher severity related to a combination of labor and material price increases. As a reminder, for homeowners, we expect the fourth quarter to be the seasonally lowest quarter for loss levels. So notwithstanding the relatively low fourth quarter combined ratio, the homeowners product line continues to experience elevated weather and non-weather loss activity, and we will continue to seek rate in response. In addition, we are increasing insured values to align with labor and materials inflation which will further contribute to higher renewal premium changes in the coming quarters. Turning to production. We were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter in both auto and home. Domestic automobile policies in force grew 6% to a record level, driven by strong retention at 85%, while new business growth slowed to 4%. Renewal premium change improved from the prior quarter to 1.2% as the impact of our recent rate actions started to take effect. Renewal premium change accelerated during the quarter, and we expect it to accelerate further over the next several quarters. Domestic Homeowners and other delivered another excellent quarter with policies in force up 7%, also to a record level driven by retention of 85% and renewal premium change of 8.7%. New business levels were strong and consistent with the prior year quarter. As I mentioned, we expect higher renewal premium changes going into 2022. Our Personal Insurance success continues to benefit from ongoing investments to modernize our suite of products, expand our distribution partnerships and leverage the power of technology. One notable example was highlighted in our press release last week regarding the introduction of IntelliDrive Plus in three states. IntelliDrive Plus builds on our existing IntelliDrive capabilities by capturing mileage in addition to driving behavior, demonstrating our continued investment in telematics solutions to offer customers even more options to personalize their insurance. Reflecting on the full year, we are pleased with our personal insurance results, which includes segment income of $760 million, a combined ratio of 96.5%, 10% net premium growth and record policies in force in both product lines. In closing, while we face some environmental headwinds in the near term, we remain confident in our ability to execute in the face of these challenges and are well positioned to profitably grow our business overtime. On behalf of Greg, Jeff and myself, I'd like to thank our distribution partners and our teams for a successful 2021. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael, and we're ready to open up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Phillips: My first question goes to auto and -- first to auto and then speed to which I guess you think you can get improvements there given you're more of a package writer. So we've seen retention held study relatively steady. Others are seeing drops there as they kind of curtail growth. Your pricing of 1.2%, clearly not enough, obviously, but I'm sure you'll take more as you said. But is the fact that you're more of a package writer, more of a hindrance to your ability to get the improvements that you think you need over the course of the year versus peers that don't have as much package? Is that more of a hindrance? And will that create more of a slowdown in profitability as the year comes out?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Michael, it's Michael Klein. So I would say the short answer is no, but let me unpack that a little bit. So first, the fact that we're a package writer, I actually think the benefit of being a portfolio of solution providers showed through in our results this quarter with relatively strong performance in home balancing some of the challenges we see in auto, number one. Number two, because we have a balanced portfolio of about 50% property, 50% auto, our overall segment results are actually less sensitive to the trends in auto than the average competitor who was more, say, 60-40, 70-30. Probably most importantly, though, is there's nothing about our being a portfolio solution provider that influences our resolve to improve profitability in auto. As you mentioned, the 1.2% that we posted in the quarter is encouraging, but clearly not enough, which is why we're on a path towards accelerating renewal premium change over time. And we're in the process of continuing to evaluate our loss experience, final adjusted rates based on that loss experience and file for take and get approval for the rate we need to improve the profitability of the line.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, Michael. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And obviously, the package and the homeowner benefits really helps. So thank you. Second question is specific to reserves and specifically on COVID reserves that you set up at the beginning of COVID. So almost two years ago, everybody who's Sky's following it's going to be the worst industry ever, clearly not the case. But we've had delta with that Omicron and so there's still some concerns. But I guess last I've seen from you guys' comments on that is still the bulk of your reserves there, which I think are north of $250 million, far an IBNR. So at what point do you get comfort and saying that either comes down because they're not going to get reported? Or have you seen anything that's been reported is it still the bulk IBNR? So where do we get some comfort that -- where do you get comfort that it's time to maybe move that number down?\nAlan Schnitzer: Michael, it's Alan. Let me start, and then I'll just kick it over to Dan. But just to clarify, we never said the sky was falling. We never said this was going to be the worst Just to clarify industry commentary. But let me -- let me turn it over to Dan for the substantive response.\nDan Frey: Sure, Michael. So it's a fair question. We say the same thing exiting 2021, as we've been saying for the past several quarters, which is when we look back, back to the beginning of the pandemic and the reserves that we established related to losses specifically for the pandemic sitting here at the end of 2021, it's still the case that the majority of those losses are sitting in IBNR. And as we've said in each of the last few quarters, I think we've taken a cautious approach in that regard. I think there's uncertainty as to what the ultimate severity may be for some of those claims. We know courts are not yet fully reopened. So, reporting patterns may be slowed we're just going to continue to take a cautious approach. Having said that, within our PYD figures, there is favorability from accident year '20, there's also favorability from accident years, '19, '18, '17, '16, '15, '14 and so on. So I think we're trying to be cautious. We're not ignoring where there's good news. I just think the degree to which we're reacting to that good news has been pretty cautious.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: A couple of questions here. First, I'm just curious, when we take a look at the renewal rate trends here and take -- and your historical kind of loss trend that you've talked about, I think it was around 5%. How close are we to that? And I think I just want to clarify, I think you also said that you're expecting to continue to take rate that will kind of be margin accretive throughout 2022.\nAlan Schnitzer: Brian, it's Alan. I think we said price and the industry observers get very, very focused on that rate and loss trend number. And I think in some circumstances, that's appropriate and some is just you look at the overall 9.2 points of price, if you look at our effective execution and segmentation of that across the book that 9.2, if you look back over 15 or 20 years, you can't find that many quarters with price at that level. And so the combination of the rate we're getting and the exposure continues to contribute to written margin expansion.\nBrian Meredith: Got you. Makes curious, taking a look at your full year underlying combined ratio in your business Insurance, I mean it's probably as low as it's been in the last decade or more. I guess my question there is are you thinking there fees to get lower here? Or are you kind of at an acceptable level kind of from a return perspective at this point?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think we're going to stay away from giving a lot of specific forecasts. I mean, Greg, I think, did speak to that in his prepared remarks. So we do think that there are continue to be headwinds, and Greg specified what they were. We continue to think that we've got to do more to offset those. And so we'll continue to to price and execute to do that. But I think we're going to avoid giving specific outlook on a metric.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: I had a couple on the ag treaty. First of all, was there any benefit on the underlying loss ratio this quarter for the recoveries on that? Or was it all just cats?\nDan Frey: Ryan, it's Dan. So I know I go through the comments fast, but in my comments, I gave you $34 million of benefit to the underlying in the quarter, which was $10 million to BI and $24 million to PI, but the lion's share 220 plus was to cats.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then follow-up is, I think in the past, you sort of set the self-retention on that treaty in central way kind of in line with your view of what -- internally of what your cat load was. Should we interpret the higher self-retention in the aggregate as you guys having raised your internal view of your cat load? Or was that just a function of renewal discussions, harder terms and conditions?\nDan Frey: So a couple of comments there, Ryan. One, I think some of the analysts have assumed that the attachment point was a proxy for our for our cat load. We've never said that and it doesn't work quite that way. Having said that, the increase in the attachment point is generally going to be reflective of the growth of our business. So, as the business is bigger, we would expect cat losses on a dollar basis to grow. And then, the attachment point and the change from $5 million deductible per event to a $10 million deductible per event. That's the combination of what was available in the marketplace and what we felt was an appropriate deal to pursue.\nOperator: The next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: I had a couple of questions. First, just on the auto business. You mentioned the 1.2% increase on rates that you got. Can you compare that to what you're actually speaking in terms of price hikes and just the process of sort of getting approvals and how they should flow through? Just trying to get an idea on whether you think margins can begin to improve if inflation does not cool down? And then I had another one.\nMichael Klein: Sure, Jimmy. Thanks for the question. It's Michael. So the 1.2%, right, is the written renewal premium change across the portfolio. You could sort of think of it as including a weighted average of the rate we've achieved in the states we've gotten it, right? So 11 out of, call it, 46 states, we got rate in. The other important thing is the 11 -- the number, the 11 that I gave you is a new business effective date, not a renewal effective date. So there's a little bit of a lag in the impact on renewals. Underneath that 1.2% -- what I would say is in terms of the process, we are largely being successful in achieving the rate we're asking for state by state. Obviously, every state is a little bit different. But as I mentioned, we're pursuing the right we think we need based on the trends we see. Your point about what happens with severity and loss trend from here is a really good one, right? The filings we got approved in the fourth quarter of last year, were based on our experience and our outlook for trends at that point in time. And as we seek additional rate as we move into 2022, we'll continue to update those assessments and those assumptions, and that will drive the rate we request on a state-by-state basis. But the 1.2% is really mostly a function of the fact that it's in 20% of the states we're writing in. And as we get more rate approved in more states, that will drive that acceleration.\nJimmy Bhullar: And besides California, are there any major states where you're having a hard time getting price increases because I think California hasn't approved anything so far?\nMichael Klein: Again, I would say most of the states that we are working with, we've been able to get approved what we thought, and I really wouldn't point to any states that have made a particular challenge.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on workers' comp, I think there's been hope for almost two years now, the pricing would turn. What are you seeing? And what are your expectations on pricing for that line?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Jimmy, this is Greg Toczydlowski. In Alan's prepared comments, you mentioned that we saw a little more of a negative than we have in prior quarters on that. And that really is generated based on the strong industry profitability and profitability from ourselves also. So a couple of quarters back, we would have thought that we would have been getting above zero, but the pandemic had -- with the contraction of the economy. Some very favorable results overall on frequency on workers' comp. And so the bureaus that really regulate that particular product or all at a state level looking at direct COVID losses and indirect COVID losses, and they do a pretty good job of predicting where the future loss costs are. And so think it's going to be a little bit longer than what we did a couple of quarters ago just because of that strong profitability before it might get above zero.\nOperator: The next question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question on the related to inflation and loss trends. Are you guys seeing any upward factor on offense and full-term closing climate gains or any other factors? And then I know it came off a couple of times on the call, but can you just confirm that within BI, you loss trend assumption does still sit at that 5% level that you've been talking about?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Elyse, yes, we have not changed our general view of loss trend in BI. But remember, loss trend is a long-term view of a loss inflation. And there are other levers for us to account for other sort of loss activity going on that we don't necessarily think as part of long-term trends. So we can change the base here. We can book losses relative to what we see in any particular quarter. And so I think you heard from Michael, in particular, I know your question was about BI, but you heard from Michael, in particular that we did book some losses in PI and BI as well for severity, think labor and material inflation. So we did see a little bit of that, and that's reflected in our numbers. I think you heard from Dan in his prepared remarks that in terms of social inflation, while I would say what we're seeing maybe is a little bit better than what we saw a few years ago, but we're assuming that's due to distortion in the data, and that hasn't abated at all. So we continue to account for that. And you mentioned climate change. Climate change is a hard one to think about in any given period because you think about weather patterns over a long period of time. But clearly, if you just look at four of the last five years, our cat experience was worse than what we would have expected. And so whether that's climate change, whether that's other factors, think demographic changes, people moving into harm's way, people building larger homes. I mean there's all sorts of things that are contributing to that. But we do see weather patterns, and we do take weather patterns into account in our loss picks and our pricing.\nElyse Greenspan: Great. And then my second question, Alan, you made the comment that within win price should outpace lasted for a while. And I know when you make that comment, you responded to an earlier question, right, that you're more looking at the RPC for that 9.2% as it relates to the trend. But how should we think about thinking about the gap, I guess, continuing to narrow between that nine and that five? And would you expect, you say some time, is that a comment sustaining to all of 2022?\nAlan Schnitzer: As we look out into the future, and this is always the case, there's nothing unusual about this moment in time, but the crystal ball gets a little bit easy sometimes. And so, it's hard for us to be very specific about how long anything is going to last. Any trend is going to last in this business. But when we look at overall pricing in BI in excess of nine and think about where loss trend is, we're comfortable where the trends are heading. And I shared as we do from time to time that our pricing ex workers' comp was seven, which is also a historically very strong number. And so we look at all that and say it's going to continue to -- certainly based on our view of estimated loss trends, continue to contribute to margin expansion for exactly how long, I don't know, and it's going to vary by line. Greg pointed out and you can see in the data we've been getting pretty good price increases for a while now, which has changed our overall return profile and view of rate adequacy. So from here, some lines are will keep going up. Some will go sideways, some -- the rate of increase will decrease. But we're very comfortable. We executed on a very deliberate basis. We've got the data. We've got the insight. And really importantly, we've got the underwriting expertise at the point of sale to know what we want to do on that marginal account. So it's about getting the right price on the account and either putting it in the portfolio if we don't have it or keeping it if we do. And so we're very comfortable with the execution and what the outlook is.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: The first one I had is on Bond & Specialty. If we consider the COVID that I think was included in the year ago number, I want to say it was 2 points or so. Underlying loss ratio got to touch worse despite a lot of rate being taken. So just I was interested if you could unpack that for us a little on what some of the drivers were?\nDan Frey: Alex, it's Dan. So just to be clear, you're looking at the Bond & Specialty underlying combined ratio for the fourth quarter?\nAlex Scott: Yes. Just the year-over-year, I think, by our math, it got a little worse when we exclude COVID, although I'm not totally sure exactly if there was any COVID impact that maybe it was in this quarter, but could you just talk about sort of that year-over-year comp, ex COVID and what some of the drivers are?\nDan Frey: Yes. We're really -- so the printed number just to make sure we're looking at the same thing as an 83.3% this quarter, down from an 85% last quarter. That's mostly driven that improvement is mostly driven by the impact of earned price relative to loss trend. COVID in the fourth quarter of last year was not a big factor.\nAlex Scott: Got it. Okay. Then maybe switching over to Business Insurance for my second question. As mentioned, I think, a couple of times that there's a lot of other factors beyond just the pure rate versus loss trend. And some of those being exposed to acting like rate, terms and conditions changes. And you spoke a lot about what you're doing on claims handling and becoming more efficient. Is there a way for us to think about order of magnitude impact from some of those things and how much improvement could kind of continue from those elements that are a little harder to quantify?\nDan Frey: Yes. Alex, I don't know that there really is. I mean there's a lot of potential things in there. In addition to pricing and whoever interest rates go, you've got risk selection and mix and reinsurance and claims handling expenses, terms and conditions. And I think frankly, it's hard on the inside to calibrate to calibrate the impact of those. And we've obviously got more insight into it than you do and methodology for doing it. But I'm not sure how you do it from the outside. Dan, am I missing something?\nDan Frey: I don't think so. There's a lot of things around the edges. I think the fundamental point is it's not -- margins are not just going to necessarily behave in line with the headline rate versus trend.\nOperator: The next question will come from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPaul Newsome: Congratulations on the quarter. up my questions on auto. And I don't even know if we have enough data, but my sense is that driving behavior changed. And so even though frequency is kind of back where it was pre pandemic, people are driving at different times in different ways. Is there any way to quantify that impact? Because I think we're thinking of severity as sort of a pure inflation impact, but I don't know if that's the case. And just wondering if your data suggests one way or the other.\nMichael Klein: Sure, Paul. Michael, it's Michael. It's a great question. I think it's something that we continue to monitor. I would say that there are a couple of places that we have data that demonstrate changes in driving behavior. One is just the driving patterns, right, commuting versus noncommuting, time of day. And whether you look at external data sources, whether we look at our own IntelliDrive data, we do see a shift in those driving patterns. The other item that, again, I think you'll see in here, talk about quite a bit is just change in driving behavior. And so in the context of those new driving patterns, we and industry observers have observed increased speeds. When you look at the -- unfortunately, the continued rise in fatalities on highways, some of the data shows increased evidence of fewer people seatbelts, having an impact on fatality data. And again, our own data and that from others also indicates increases in distracted driving, interacting with the phone while operating the vehicle. So I think we do see changes in again, time of day, type of driving and actual driving behavior that will have an impact on losses. Quantifying exactly how much of the change is driven by that is more challenging. Frankly, when we look at increased severity in auto, the biggest drivers continue to be used car prices and labor in parts to repair vehicles, particularly in the context of coverages like collision and property damage.\nPaul Newsome: And then my second question is Business Insurance. Normally, at least my normally when I think of seeing exposure increases that has essentially a related claims increase, as you can imagine, higher exposures. But there's also an embedded piece of effective price increase in exposure, which ordinarily is very hard to figure out if it's there. Is there anything that would make this time different from the past with the impact of exposures because what we're seeing today is exposure is rising in some parts because of relief from COVID as opposed to what I think you normally think of a sort of ordinary economic growth?\nAlan Schnitzer: I don't know how to answer that question with great precision. I mean, it's in part why I chose to point out the wage inflation from the Bureau of Labor statistics because wage inflation relative to headcount increase, for example, you'd think of as a relatively larger increase to margin contribution. But other than that -- and it's all sort of a blunt instrument. We spent a lot of time thinking about how we should be thinking about the contribution of exposure to margins and it's complicated for us. And again, another place we probably have more insight into the data. But it's a complicated analysis and there's a lot of judgment involved. But at least one component to think of is wage inflation versus headcount increases.\nOperator: The next question will come from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJosh Shanker: It was an outstanding quarter in the homeowners a silo. And obviously, you guys are taking rates there. Are we to rate adequacy in homeowners? And when we look at the margins in homeowners versus auto, when you're thinking about a bundled customer, do you need to make profit in both the home and the auto part? Or do you look at the customer and let's make a profit on the customers' complete package of policies?\nMichael Klein: Sure. Thanks, Josh. It's Michael. I would say the answer to the second part of your question is yes. We like to make money on the customer, but we really do. We price at line of business. And while we talk about account pricing sort of across the organization, Greg talks about it all the time in business insurance, the way that pricing works in the personal line space, you get rate filed and approved by product. Now we have some interline dynamics in terms of the way our pricing models work, but we really do seek to earn our target margins by line and in aggregate, whether that's across the business or customer by customer. In terms of the profitability in home, again, I think in my prepared remarks, I indicated this, right? I wouldn't overreact to the 78 in the fourth quarter. We're pleased with it. We're happy with it. That said, the full year is still at 98, which is up from last year. Underlying is an 85 from last year. So the fourth quarter really hasn't changed our resolve in terms of our need to continue to drive price and terms in property. And then the other thing, I think, is an important dynamic to watch for in 2022 is RPC for property will also be impacted by insured values. And I mentioned it in the script, but we're seeking to increase values in the homeowners' line in response to home prices and labor and material inflation. And so you'll see that start to show up in pricing in 2022.\nOperator: The next question will come from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Motemaden: I had a follow-up just for Alan. You gave a 7% renewal rate change in business insurance, and that was excluding workers' comp. Could you just talk about how that's trended over the last few quarters and maybe some of the drivers behind it?\nAlan Schnitzer: David, we typically actually don't give that number. We get it from time to time episodically when we think it's relevant for providing an insight into the results we're achieving. But we don't give it routinely. I'm not even sure I know of and how that number is necessarily trended, although I would probably just pull the lens back a little bit and say, over the last few years, pricing has been very strong. And so I mean that's probably the lens I'd give you on that.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And then maybe just moving -- I guess, sticking in Business Insurance and great to see the premium written growth this quarter. Even -- you mentioned renewal premium change, obviously, the 9.2, but I noticed that new business really moved the needle this quarter, and that's a change versus prior couple of quarters. So I'm just wondering, did something change in terms of your appetite for new business, any enhancements that you've made this quarter versus the last few I'm just trying to get a sense for how sustainable you think the 9% growth is as we head into 2022.\nGreg Toczydlowski: David, this is Greg. In my prepared comments, I did share with you that we were more successful in some larger accounts in middle market. And if you go back, I've shared with you that that's lumpy at times. Last quarter, we didn't hit that as many large accounts in the quarter before we did. And so you get a little bit of lumpiness when you get into accounts greater than 500,000. And that was one dynamic. But generally, also our underlying combined ratio is across our full portfolio of the book of business, and that includes new business. So as we continue to improve the margins on the business, we continue have better outlook in terms of what our new business is. Our underwriters are incredibly disciplined around risk selection and they want to be active partners for our agents and brokers and our as our business continues to improve. We continue to be more active with our hits on our new business.\nAlan Schnitzer: And David, I'll just share just stepping back from the results in the quarter. Key to everything we do and key to I think the success we had in BI is franchise value. It's having products and services, our customers, agents and brokers value. It's having the data and analytics to segment the risk and get the right price on it. It's making sure we've got great experiences for all of our constituencies. It's a lot of hustle. And all of our innovation priorities and all the investments we're making are generally speaking, aligned to those things. So I do think that has an impact on everything. It's on our retention and our ability to get the pricing did and on the new business.\nOperator: The next question is from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: Just a quick follow-up question on your Jan 1 underlying aggregate reinsurance renewal. If I just look at the upper limit, it looks like your $225 million coverage is down from $350 million last year. So I guess I'm wondering, was the objective to remain cost neutral in response to rising reinsurance pricing or less appetite by reinsurers to offer aggregate cover.\nDan Frey: Tracy, it's Dan. It's really more of the latter. So if you look at -- this is now the fourth year we've had this treaty. And it's always covered a $500 million layer. How much of that lighter we place each year is a function of our view of appropriate price in terms and conditions and the reinsurers view of appropriate pricing terms and conditions. And so, we went from 86% the first year down to 56% the second year. This last year was up to 70%. This year is in at 45%. It's -- we're not trying to manage the total cost of the treaty. Pricing did not move that significantly on the treaty. It's really just an intersection of our appetite and the reinsurance market's appetite.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on personal auto. Similar to last quarter, it sound pretty confident of all the rate increases you're taking. But I noticed your 6% TIF growth was pretty high number year-over-year for Travelers. Do you think that's something that could slow down in subsequent quarters? Or could that be like a new normal given some of the strategic stuff you're doing like IntelliDrive?\nMichael Klein: Yes, Tracy, great question. I would say you got to look at both the year-over-year and sequential quarter numbers there. 5%, 6%, 1%, 2% sequential quarter growth we do think it's driven by the investments we're making in the product. But it's also a function of our pricing relative to the market notwithstanding the fact that the 6% is up from 5%. Policies grew less than 40,000 in this quarter versus more than 40,000 in the prior two, which is why you see the sequential quarter growth coming down. And then again, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that new business production has slowed. So again, we're focused on the rate we think we need to drive into the product and improving the profitability in response to the loss trends. The growth is really going to be an outcome as opposed to a target, and we'll see how our pricing strategy plays out relative to the market over the next next several quarters.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Got it. If I could just sneak sorry, one more in. I think there has been a lot of earlier talk about packaging. But if I could just focus on your policies being written on 12-month paper for auto. Do you think you have to push rate increases a little bit harder because others are just talking about taking multiple bites on the apple, so they may be more agile?\nMichael Klein: Yes. So again, it's Michael. I'd say those are two different things. right? So one is your filing strategy, the other is your product mix. We do tend to write more 12-month policies than a lot of our auto mono line or autofocus competitors, but we do write a mix of 12 and 6-month policies. The fact that we write more 12-month policies, though it doesn't mean that we can't take multiple rate changes in a jurisdiction in a year. And so we may, in some states take a couple of rate increases in 2022, and those will hit the renewals as they hit them depending upon the policy terms. But I think our filing strategy, we can be as agile as anyone else, what that impacts renewals will vary a little bit based on our policy. But we don't see it as a significant barrier in terms of our ability to make progress.\nOperator: The next question is from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nYaron Kinar: So my first question, maybe a little bit long-winded, but hopefully, you bear with me. So in personal auto, looking back to the 2014 to '16 cycle, I think many had pointed to the deterioration of bodily injury severity, particularly for high-limit policies, whereas this time around I think the deterioration is really coming from physical damage severity. So if you agree with that premise, is it reasonable to think that Travelers given that it is more weighted to higher limit preferred insurance would need less rate then more standard and nonstandard books and therefore would maybe benefit from market share gains here?\nMichael Klein: I guess I would say that it's reasonable to -- I wouldn't assume it. I think it's reasonable to monitor that. I would say that our pricing strategy is reflective of our book of business and our loss experience. And so in many respects, we have a different rate need than another competitor because of the profile of our book, the mix of our book, we also do tend to write more full coverage. So even the product we're providing to the customer, right, when you get into the nonstandard market, you tend to see a little more liability only. And so that's going to change the pricing dynamics. But again, I would say we're seeking the rate we think we need based on our loss experience and the trends we see. But profile and mix of business could definitely in addition to what you just described, state mix is going to also have an impact on the aggregate headline number than any given carrier needs.\nYaron Kinar: Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question, probably for Alan, so you talked about the investment in technology, I think as over $1 billion -- well over $1 billion in annual spend. I don't remember and acquisition related to technology at least since simply business 2016. I was wondering maybe you could elaborate on why are we not seeing more through is it a function of valuation that the idea doesn't be outside are not compelling enough. Maybe you can help us understand that.\nAlan Schnitzer: Your question came through a little bit garbled, and we couldn't quite understand it here. Could you try one more time?\nYaron Kinar: Sure. I'm trying to get a better understanding of the investment in technology. I don't remember seeing any M&A from Travelers simply business back in 2017. And I'm just trying to understand why is it that you're choosing to really build all of this organically as opposed to pursue maybe opportunities that are presented through third parties. Is it a function of valuations only? Is that a function of just the ideas that are presented by these third parties not being compelling enough for the Company? What's driving the choice to build organically?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Well, I guess that's not exactly true. I mean for -- just to give you an example on the top of my head, we acquired Insurer match not too long ago. But I think you're asking a philosophical questions we'll give you a philosophical answer we approach it pre agnostically. So we're happy to buy it. We're happy to build it and are happy to license it. And in virtually every significant investment we make, we take a step back and we say, what are the capabilities we need and what's the fastest, most cost-effective, least risky way to get it. And if it's proprietary, we want to own it or control it or buy it or develop it. If it's not, we're happy to go get it in other ways. But in any significant investment we make, we do a very thorough evaluation of all the opportunities.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question. That question will come from Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Zaremski: Maybe moving to auto. I guess, are you seeing a frequency benefit from a spike in pandemic sorry, in COVID cases? Because otherwise, it just feels like there's still a big gap between severity, just overall loss trend and the pricing you're seeing?\nMichael Klein: Yes. Great question, Mike. It's Michael. I think our own data in terms of miles driven and external sources, whether you look at Department of Transportation or others, show a little bit of a slowdown in the back half of December. I'd say it's too soon to call that a trend. You've got the holiday in there, you've got weather impacts in there. There's a lot of noise around whether you got a good baseline comparison in terms of the data we're seeing, but it's certainly something we're paying attention to. But again, broadly speaking, in the quarter, we saw miles driven in claim frequency, again, largely approaching pre-pandemic levels across the period.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Great. And my follow-up is on Bond & Specialty. Greg mentioned non-renewing of a number of cyber accounts having a meaningful favorable impact. Any kind of color you can provide on whether cyber was -- has been a negative impact in '21? And which might kind of help results into '22?\nJeff Klenk: Yes. Thanks for the question, Mike. This is Jeff. We've been fairly vocal that the cyber trends for the last few years relative to ransomware has been an impact, not just for us, but you've also seen that in the broader marketplace. We took actions in the middle of 2021 and to get pretty affirmative and deliberate relative to the cybersecurity protocols, multifactor authentication on our new business. And while the results are still early, we did think that it was important to point out we're seeing that the quality of the cybersecurity does have a value to the organizations that have it in place. We're already seeing it in the frequency, and we thought that it was important not to mention that just for our own results, but for the broader market.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, everyone. We appreciate you joining the call this morning. And as usual, if there's any follow-up, please reach out directly to Investor Relations. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may all disconnect at this time."}, {"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 3, "year": 2021, "date": "2021-10-19 13:33:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 19, 2021. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers discussion of our Third Quarter 2021 results. We released our press release financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors Section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO, Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer, and our three Segment President, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeff Klenk of Bond and Specialty Insurance, and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They we'll refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes Forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the Forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under Forward-looking Statements in our earnings press release, and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update Forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report strong top and bottom-line results for the quarter. And the first 9 months of the year, including very strong underlying underwriting profitability and healthy top-line growth. Core income year-to-date of $2.2 billion is about $800 million higher year-over-year, generating Core Return on equity of 11.6%. Core income for the quarter was $655 million or $2.60 per Diluted shares. Generating core return on equity of 10.1%, despite a high level of catastrophe losses. Our Cat losses were well below our market share, well above the prior-year quarter and the 10-year average for the quarter. Underwriting income of $632 million pre -tax was 6% higher than in the prior-year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $7.8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. We're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses. The underlying combined ratio improved by almost 4 points in Business Insurance, and more than 5 points in Bond and Specialty Insurance. As you'll hear in a few minutes from Michael, underlying results in Personal Insurance were impacted by out of frequency returning to pre-pandemic levels, and elevated severity in both auto and property due to higher costs for labor materials. Our consolidated results demonstrate the value of having a diversified group of businesses. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $645 million after-tax, reflecting reliable performance in our fixed income portfolio and very strong returns in our non-fixed income portfolio. These results together with our strong balance sheet and cash flow, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 10% over the past year. After making important investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $821 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $601 million of share repurchases. Turning to the top-line, net written premiums grew 7% to a record $8.3 billion. Each of our 3 segments again contributed meaningfully to the top-line growth. In Business Insurance, net. Written premiums grew by 5% with renewal premium change of 9.9% up more than 200 basis points year-over-year. And near all-time high renewal premium change was driven by continued strong renewal rate change and higher exposure growth. Importantly, at the same time, retention was also higher. Our ability to continue to drive price change at historical highs while increasing retention reflects excellent marketplace execution and the stability of the pricing environment. In Bond and Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 19%, driven by record renewal premium change of 13.6% and our Management Liability business and continued strong retention. We are also pleased to report strong production in our surety business. In our commercial businesses, written pricing continues to outpace estimated loss trend, which will continue to benefit margins as it earns in. Given social and other inflation, the frequency and severity of weather-related loss activity, and the low interest rate environment, we expect the pricing environment to remain strong. In Personal Insurance net written premiums increased by 7%. Policies in force in both auto and homeowners were at record levels, driven by continued strong retention and growth in new business. Before I wrap up on results, I'd like to spend a minute discussing how our leading data and analytics and risk expertise contributed to our relatively favorable loss experience with Hurricane Ida. As I shared in our in our first quarter earnings call, our share of the industry's property cat losses over the past 5 years, have been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share. And while there's always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, it was no accident that we again outperformed in Hurricane Ida. Our leading underwriting expertise supported by cutting edge data analytics are key to an effective assessment of risk and reward. For us, third-party models are starting point for our more advanced proprietary cat modeling. At the portfolio level, the insights from our models warned us away from the coast to where Ida made landfall. Given the impediments to achieving an appropriate risk-adjusted return. In the other states, in Ida's path. We effectively managed risk selection, pricing, and other terms and conditions by putting sophisticated data and analytics at the fingertips of our frontline underwriters. These include robust flood risk scoring, location intelligence down to the parcel level, hail dashboards, and output from our risk control engineers. Within Personal Insurance, we continue to see the benefits from our highly segmented Quantum Home 2.0 products, which is now hold out in more than 40 states. In the Northeast, extreme rainfall from Ida resulted in significant claim activity for the industry, including from water and drainage backup, which is a coverage we provide in our QH 2.O products. The model underneath the product leverages data and analytics to underwrite and price dot coverage on a very granular basis. In addition to underwriting, data and analytics are increasingly informing our claims handling strategies. For example, our AI-assisted claim damage detection model was a key part of our Ida claim response. This model uses AI and high-resolution aerial imagery to detect the extent of damage to individual properties as soon as a day after an event. Within two days of impact, we were collecting and analyzing aerial imagery of customer properties along Ida's path as it moved across 20 states. This enabled us to remotely identify which of our customers properties had sustained exterior damage and effectively organize our claim response. In some cases, we can use this technology to adjust and pay total losses before the customer has even been able to return to their home. We also utilized other virtual capabilities in our IDA response, such as image share and live video capture, on a majority of claims with interior damage. These leading edge capabilities, enhancing claim experience for our customers by cutting significant time out of the claim process. Expediting an accurate loss assessment and in many cases, eliminating the need for physical inspection. Again, with IDA, we successfully closed 90% of all homeowners plans within 30 days. All of this also results in a more efficient outcome for our shareholders. As strategic as the data and analytics are, maybe even more important is the culture that brings it all together. Our collaborative approach to developing a holistic, 360-degree view of risk, incorporating underwriting, claims, actuarial risk-control, legal and regulatory inputs is an important differentiating factor in effectively managing risk and reward. That culture is decades in the making and very hard to replicate. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to welcome Jeff Klenk, president of our Bond and Specialty Insurance segment of the call. I shared last quarter, Jeff is a 22-year veteran at Travelers most recently as a member of Tom Kunkel leadership team and head of our Management Liability business. Jeff succeeded Tom, following his retirement last month. We're fortunate to have Jeff in the role and you will hear from him in a few minutes. To sum it up, we're pleased with our results for the quarter to year-to-date. Our significant and hard to replicate competitive advantages position us very low and continued to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n Dan Frey : Thank you, Alan. For our income for the third quarter was $655 million compared to $798 million in the prior-year quarter. For the quarter, core Return On Equity was 10.1% and on a year-to-date basis, core ROE was 11.6%. The decline in core income was driven by prior-year reserve development and catastrophe losses. Recall that last year's PYD, benefited by approximately $400 million of subrogation recoveries from PG&E. Those unfavorable year-over-year comparisons were partially offset by increased investment income and a higher level of underlying underwriting income. Underlying underwriting income increased 6% to $632 million pretax, reflecting a higher level of earned premium in all 3 segments, and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond and Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio and Personal Insurance. Business Insurance and Bond and Specialty results reflected the benefit of our pricing efforts, as earned price continues to exceed loss trend. We expected a higher underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance, given that last year's quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses related to the pandemic. As Alan mentioned, the underlying combined ratio in PI was further impacted by higher severity in both the auto and homeowners products. Greg, Jeff, and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes. On a consolidated basis, the underlying loss ratio for the quarter improved slightly to 62% compared with last year's 62.2%. The expense ratio of 29.4% was in line with the prior-year quarter and in line with our expectations. We've improved the expense ratio by more than 2 points from where we were 5 years ago. Having added roughly $7 billion to our annual net written premiums over that period, while maintaining a focus on productivity and efficiency, all while adding significantly to the level of strategic investment we're making to ensure our future success. Before turning to catastrophe losses, I wanted to point out that within our underlying combined ratio. Non-Cat weather was higher than we would have assumed for the quarter, although lower than the unusually high levels we'd experienced in last year's third quarter. Our third quarter Cat losses were $501 million pre -tax compared to $397 million a year ago. Remember that in last year's third quarter we had a full recovery under the property aggregate catastrophe XoL treaty. In this year's third quarter, we recognized a partial recovery of $95 million from the treaty, $83 million benefiting the Cat line with $43 million in Business Insurance and $39 million in Personal Insurance, and $12 million benefiting our underlying results with 3 million in Business Insurance and 9 million in Personal Insurance. That leaves us with $255 million of potential recovery in the fourth quarter, depending on the level of qualifying losses we actually experienced. In terms of the level of Cat losses relative to our assumptions. Third-quarter Cats were elevated compared to what we would have assumed for a typical third quarter. Although our losses from Hurricane Ida are well below our relative market share, the sheer size of Ida, on top of the other Cat losses in the quarter, resulted in overall Cat losses that were higher than our assumption. Turning to prior-year reserve development and Personal Insurance, $30 million of pretax net favorable PYD resulted from better-than-expected experience from recent years in the property line and Bond and Specialty Insurance, $22 million of pre -tax net favorable PYD was driven by favorable loss experience in the surety product line for recent [Indiscernible].years. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD was $108 million pretax. Our annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $225 million, as the level of claim activity did not decline as much as we had assumed in our previous estimate. Excluding the asbestos charge, Business Insurance had net favorable prior year reserve development of $117 million driven primarily by better-than-expected loss experience in workers comp across multiple accident years. Net investment income improved to $645 million after-tax this quarter, our non-fixed income portfolio delivered another strong result, contributing $224 million after-tax. As you can see from the detail provided on Page 6 of the webcast presentation, our recent results in the non-fixed income portfolio have been unusually strong, and I would caution you that this level of returns is not likely to continue. Consistent with our expectations, fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior-year quarter, as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by a decline in yields. For the fourth quarter of 2021, we expect NII from the fixed income portfolio, including earnings from short-term securities of between $425 and $435 million after-tax. For 2022, we expect that figure to be between $420 and $430 million per quarter. Turning to capital management, operating cash flow for the quarter of $2.5 billion was an all-time record. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding Company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. The market value of the bonds in our fixed income portfolio declined as U.S. treasury yields increased and credit spreads widened during the quarter. Accordingly, our after-tax net unrealized investment gain decreased from $3.2 billion as of June 30th to $2.7 billion at September 30th. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $104.77 at quarter-end, up 5% since year-end, and up 10% since September 30th of last year. We returned $821 million of capital to our shareholders during the third quarter with $220 million of dividends and $601 million in share repurchases. Overall, a very good quarter for us with healthy top-line growth, strong, and improved underlying margins in our commercial businesses. Excellent cash flows and a terrifically strong balance sheet. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace. Segmenting gold was $558 million for the Quarter up more than 50% from the prior-year quarter. The improved year-over-year result was driven by higher underlying underwriting income. Prior year reserve development. And higher net investment income, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses we're once again, particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 90.2%, which improved by 3.8 points from the third quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to three things. First. Of up two points of the improvement resulted from third, pricing that continued to exceed loss - cost trends. The other nearly two points resulted from a combination of a favorable impact associated with the pandemic and a lower level of property losses. Turning to the top-line, net written premiums were up 5%, benefiting from strong renewal rate and exposure levels as well as high retentions. As for domestic production, renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.9% while retention increased to an exceptional 85%. The 9.9% renewal premium change was up more than two points from the third quarter of last year with strong renewal rate change of 6.3% and continued improvement in our customer's exposure growth. In addition to our granular price execution, we've also focused on careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sub-limits, and exclusions, which can also contribute to an increase in the price per unit of rest. New business was down from the prior-year quarter as we continue to be thoughtful about balancing risks and reward for new business in the marketplace. For the individual businesses, in select renewal premium change was a strong 9.7% while retention improved for recent periods to 82% underneath RPC, renewal rate change was 4.1% up well over a point from the third quarter of 2020. We're also encouraged with the improving exposure, which was up about three points as the economy continues to reopen it. New business was up a bit from the prior year, driven by the continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 39 states. In middle-market, renewal premium change of 9.5% and retention of 88% were both historically hot. Renewal rate change of 6.2% remains strong. As always, we remain disciplined around risk selection and underwriting. To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution and further improving the underlying margins in the bus, and we continue to invest in the business for long term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to our new partner in the room, Jeff Klenk.\nJeff Klenk: Thanks, Greg, and thank you, Alan, for that welcome. I'm very pleased to be here. We built an industry-leading insurance and management liability franchise, and we look forward to continuing to perform, innovate and transform to profitably grow these businesses into the future. Turning to the results, Bond and Specialty delivered excellent returns in growth in the quarter. Segment income was at $174 million, up about 50% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the impact of higher net earned premium. A significantly improved underlying underwriting margin, and favorable prior-year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 83.4% improved by 5.5 points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting lower pandemic-related loss activity, earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, and a lower expense ratio. Turning to the top-line, net written premiums grew an exceptional 19% in the quarter with strong contributions from all our businesses. In domestic management liability, renewal premium change was a record 13.6% driven by record renewal rate change. Retention remains strong at 86% consistent with recent quarters, but down a few points year-over-year. As we continue to non-renew cyber policies for accounts that don't meet our updated minimum requirements for cyber hygiene. Notably, research indicates that implementing affordable cyber risk mitigation controls, such as multi-factor authentication to prevent the vast majority of rents more to tax. Domestic surety also posted strong growth relative to the pandemic impact to prior-year quarter. In addition, our international businesses again posted excellent growth, including strong management, liability, retention and rate. Both top and bottom line results for bond and specialty were terrific this quarter, demonstrating our thoughtful approach and strong execution across our businesses. And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and welcome. Good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, bottom-line results were impacted by weather, our return to pre -pandemic claim frequency in auto, and higher loss severity impacting both Auto and Home results. Segment income declined by $394 million from the prior-year quarter. $262 million of that decline is attributable to lower favorable prior-year reserve development as the prior-year quarter benefited from the PG&E settlement Dan referenced. The remaining unfavorable variance was primarily driven by lower underlying underwriting results. Our underlying combined ratio increased by 6.5 points to 95.2%. We were pleased to see our top-line momentum continue in the quarter, with net written premiums up 7%. Automobile underwriting results reflected higher loss levels for the quarter. The combined ratio was 100% and included 3.4 points of catastrophe losses, mostly from Hurricane Ida. The underlying combined ratio was 97% up approximately 15 points from a prior-year quarter, which reflected our unusually low loss activity due to the pandemic. The underlying combined ratio increased mainly due to claim frequency effectively returning to pre-pandemic levels. In line with the trend we referenced in our prior quarter call. To a lesser degree, higher severity -- higher loss severity impacted the combined ratio as well, as the vehicle replacement and repair costs remained at elevated levels. We believe these profitability challenges are environmental, and in response, we are executing on our plans to file rate increases in about 40 states over the next three quarters. As we indicated last quarter, it will take time for future rate actions to earn into results. But we do expect to have higher rates in market in several states by year-end. In Homeowner and Other, the third quarter combined ratio increased by 16 points from the prior-year quarter to 109.3%, driven by a 24 point reduction in net favorable prior-year reserve development primarily related to the PG&E recovery from last year. The combined ratio included 17.6 points of catastrophe losses, mostly from Hurricane Ida. Homeowners' catastrophe losses were 4.7 points below a very active prior-year quarter. The underlying combined ratio was 93.3%, an improvement of 3.5 points over the prior-year quarter, which experienced a very high level of loss activities. That said, the underlying combined ratio was above our expectations, reflecting elevated non-catastrophe weather and non-weather loss activity, both of which included higher severity related to a combination of labor and materials price increases. Again, we believe these trends are environmental and we continue to see price increases in response. We're short -- Before I shift to discussing production, I'll remind you that looking ahead to the fourth quarter, there tends to be a good amount of seasonality in our combined ratio results by line of business. With the fourth quarter auto losses typically higher and fourth quarter homeowners losses typically lower than our annual average levels. Turning to production, we were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter in both auto and home. Automobile policies in force grew 5% to a record level, driven by strong retention at 85%, and continued growth in new business, which increased by 8%. Renewal premium change was essentially flat, reflecting the continued impact of the rate increases we filed in response to the pandemic. Domestic Homeowners and Other delivered another excellent quarter, with policies enforced up 7%, also to a record level, driven by retention of 85% and new business growth of 5%. Renewal premium change increased to 8.8%. In the quarter, we continued to deliver solutions that meet customers where they are, give them what they needed and serve them how they want. A couple of highlights from the quarter include, our new digital self-inspection process for property customers, which improves their on-boarding experience and provides valuable information to our underwriters and Intel will drive our proprietary auto telematics offering, which now has distracted driving as a rating variable in 40 U.S. markets and Ontario Canada, providing valuable feedback to drivers and continuing to advance our sophisticated pricing segmentation in automobile. We will continue to invest in new capabilities like these for our customers and distribution partners. Despite a challenging third quarter on the bottom line, we remain pleased with our overall performance and we are well-positioned to profitably grow our business over time. Now, I will turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks Michael. Turn to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] roster. Your first question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question, Alan, I think might be to your opening comments on BI and expect, you listed a number of reasons why price and environment should remain strong. I guess maybe, help us define or think about what you mean by strong and how we can think about maybe margins into next year the back half of next year. We have pricing now kind of close to where loss trends are, so just kind of help think about what those reasons why pricing should remain strong. Should we expect this pricing to, it seems like start to converge with well, loss trends are which obviously could have some impact on margins into 2022. So just comments on what you mean by strong there.\nAlan Schnitzer: Good morning and thanks for the question. You're very narrowly I think focusing on rate versus loss trend. And by the way, there's still a margin there. And even if you look at your rate over some long historical periods, the rate we continue to get is actually a pretty good number. But if you look at the overall pricing number, I mean, at 9.9, that's, you know, practically an all-time high and there's a lot of margin in that exposure, so we continue to see a nice spread between written price and loss trend and I do think that's the right way to think about it. Nonetheless, as we know what our product returns are, we know what headwinds are, we know what our objectives are in terms of our returns and we know what we need to do, so I think that from here, pricing will continue to be strong. Now, we've also been getting pretty good pricing for some time now and it's been compounding for a while and so you've got different lines in different places. Some need more help and others. And so, from here the rate of increase is going to be impacted by that. Some lines or the rate of increase will be higher, some will go sideways, some -- there still be an increase, the rate of increase may go down. But overall, we continue to expect pricing to remain strong. I'm not sure we're going to put much more dimension around it other than that, but hopefully that gives you some color that's helpful.\nMichael Phillips: It does, yes. Thank you. Thank you, Alan. I appreciate that. Second question for you or Mike, maybe, on personal auto. And Mike, I appreciate your comments on -- it was more of a frequency backed to preventing a little to a lesser degree the environmental issues with loss severity. So, I guess, do you think the loss severity side there on auto, has it peaked? Will it get worse from here do you think? And how long lasting will that be? I asked that because I wonder if it's to a lesser degree that the 97% core. It's not that much higher than where you were pre-pandemic, 96, 95 in that range. So I ask those questions because I wonder how much rate you think you need in personal auto if those things have already peaked, I'm not sure if they have, or how long they might last? And your comment was there to a lesser degree anyway. So any comments there would be appreciated.\nMichael Klein: Yeah, sure, Michael -- and it's Michael here. I would -- I would say a couple of things about that. So dimensional that a little bit more for you, the auto underlying combined was up 15 points in the quarter. We say three quarters of that was loss experienced returning to pre -pandemic levels, and about the remaining quarter of that is the trend then increased costs to repair and replace that we talked about last quarter that essentially continued into the quarter. In terms of how long it's going to last, I can point you to a little bit of external data that might help there. There's certainly pressure on the system. A lot of the costs relates to total losses and replacement costs values for total vehicles, which tracks pretty closely with used car prices. And inside the quarter, we were actually encouraged by the July and August data from places like the Moody's Used Car Price Index that looked like the peak had happened in May and June and was starting to decline in the first part of the quarter. Now, that data picked back up again in September, and I think it's kick back-up reflects the pressure on the system. You had Ida occur in the quarter. Estimates are that over 200,000 vehicles were destroyed in that events. At the same time, that you have vehicle inventories in the U.S. at historic lows. And so you know, I think we're going to -- we're going to see continued pressure on the cost to repair and replace. Related to supply chain, related to labor, and related to used car parts and prices. But again, that was about a quarter of the 15 points and we will factor that into our underwriting pricing decisions as we move forward.\nAlan Schnitzer: And I would just add to that, the good news is this is impacting short-tail lines where we can see it very quickly and react to it and the reserves are obviously significantly way less leveraged, given the duration of those liabilities.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thank you guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zirinski with Wells Research.\nMike Zirinski: Greg, good morning. Maybe moving to, focusing on the business segments. In Greg's commentary parsed apart the year-over-year improvement in the underlying loss ratio, and it was noted that 2 points came from a favorable impact from the pandemic. Maybe you could give us more details on that. And I believe that's a more favorable impact versus what you've laid out in previous quarters.\nDan Frey: Hey Mike, it's Dan Frey. Just to clarify Greg 's comments of about a 4 point improvement, you had about two points come from current price versus trend, and then 2 points come from the combination of favorable impact of the pandemic and some favorability in non-Cat property losses. You're right in terms of the impact on Business Insurance from the pandemic. Last year, into the third quarter, we gave you that the favorable impact was about a 0.5 point, and that was the net of direct charges that we took related to COVID I think things like workers comp charges for COVID-19. Somebody contracts the disease and that was more of an offset by indirect impacts, things like lower frequency on commercial auto. This year, you've got a larger net impact, but it's really the impact of the absence of those direct charges. We're not seeing that anywhere near the same level we saw a year ago. But the 2 you're talking about was not just attributable to COVID, it was attributable to the combination of COVID and non-Cat property experience.\nMike Zirinski: Got it. And has any, if we parse through all the loss costs commentary between commercial lines and personal lines, I know there's a lot of moving parts. But would you say on a -- on a 100 thousand foot view that Travelers had kind of an updated view of loss trend?\nDan Frey: So a little different between the two in Business Insurance, you've got a lot of moving parts, including mix of business, but we haven't seen a meaningful change in our view of long-term normalized trend, and Personal Insurance, given Michael 's comments we've taken slightly increased view of what we say as our view of long-term normalized trend.\nMike Zirinski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. My first question is on personal auto as well. You guys were talking about trying to take some price, I believe you said over the next few quarters. Are you concerned as you look for greater price that there could be some pushbacks from regulators, right? And you've, obviously, loss trend have spiked [Indiscernible], but it seems like you're also looking at 2020, which was an extremely profitable year for the industry. So how do we think about regulators and just the level of price you're looking to take within the [Indiscernible]\nMichael Klein: Sure. It's Michael. Thanks for the question. And before I address the question, I think I may have misspoken in the script. I think I said that auto RPC was impacted by the rate increases we filed in response to the pandemic. Obviously, we didn't file rate increases in response to the pandemic. Those were rate decreases, which by the way I think is relevant to your question. So as we are in the conversation with regulators which are active and ongoing as we speak, we're in conversation with them about that loss history. We're also in conversation with them about the actions we took in response, which included rate decreases in a variety of jurisdictions, which included premium refunds to customers in a variety of jurisdictions. And so we're having conversations with them around how we align pricing with loss costs over time. and are engaged in discussions with them about how to view the 2020 loss experience in that context. If I take a step back and think about the process a little bit more broadly, What we would say about the process of getting rate on is that it, you know, it is an ongoing dialogue between us and the regulators. It's about an exchange of information to justify the pricing that you think you need on a go-forward basis. And generally speaking, what we have found is we've been able to get to a point where we can align price with loss costs over time. You will, you will have some challenging conversations in some jurisdictions and maybe less challenging conversations in others. To put a little bit of a point on the 40 jurisdictions, we do expect some of those increases to become effective in Q4, and actually, a couple of them literally this month. So we're on the way to getting those increases filed and approved. And then, as we've talked about, it'll take time for them to get written and then earned into the book of business. But we're making progress.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question just goes back, I guess, to the prior question as well. You guys have been within VI at around that 5% overall loss trend for, I think, 6 quarters now. Obviously, it sounds like things have been slow to fully get back to normal with the pandemic. But as of course it started to be open in that anything you guys are paying attention to on the inflation side, as we think about loss trend just as well as expectations going into 2022.\nMichael Klein: Yeah, as you'd imagine, we're looking at all the data that comes in every quarter and there are some things that are moving up, and there are some other things that are moving down. It varies by line. We've got still some frequency benefit and the commercial auto space. There are some severity in certain elements, but those are things that we are more levered to in Michael's business than we are in Greg 's business in terms of the relative next to loss cost. So we've got our finger on the pulse of all those things and our aggregate conclusion is there's not much of a change there.\nAlan Schnitzer: And [Indiscernible] I'd add to that. There is nothing unusual about this quarter relative to any other quarter. We're always looking at frequency and severity in every line and usually there's something a little here and there. But again, this is a view of long-term trend and -- so nothing really unusual in the quarter.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, good morning. I just had a couple from Michael. The first one is, figuring about your auto book is being largely preferred. I guess, in your mind, what are some of the advantages and disadvantages of having a preferred book versus a less-preferred book when we think about the loss trend environment post-pandemic?\nMichael Klein: Good question, Ryan. I think there's a couple of things there. We generally, I would say, are going to be impacted by commuting patterns that are more related to office jobs. When you think about the general profile of a preferred book. I think the other dynamic you see in a preferred book though is newer vehicles with more technology. And so when you think about them, the cost pressures on repair and replacement costs, that's going to put upward pressure there. And I would say that while we saw I think some differences over the past 12 to 18 months that you could point to in different parts of the country, different books of business in terms of how the pandemic impacted different segments differently. As we sit here today, the economy is broadly recovering, the country is broadly recovering so you don't see quite as many differences. I don't think geographically or by segment that are driving differences in loss experience across the bit segments of the industry. The other thing that's true of our book of business is, it's heavily rounded and so it's a -- well, we talk a lot about the individual line of business, we certainly look at customers and the total portfolio as we look to manage it.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And my follow-up is, hearing you say that frequency is back at pre -pandemic levels, I guess I've always thought about pre -pandemic as being a ceiling for frequency where it would return to. Is that how you're thinking about it or based on what you're seeing, the auctioning frequency can run above pre -pandemic levels?\nMichael Klein: Yeah, it's a great question, Ryan. I would say underneath frequency, we look at driving activity, we look at trips, we look at mix of activity, and a lot of the patterns that we've talked about in the past, we continue to see. So on the one hand, we continue to see whether we look at our own IntelliDrive data, whether we look at Google mobility data. Again, fewer commute trips. On the other hand, we actually see elevated shopping trips and recreational trips. And so the mix of miles has changed, but mileage broadly, when you look at Department of Transportation data, again, our IntelliDrive data, MS2 sensor data is back to pre -pandemic levels as is frequency. Again, the mix looks a little bit different, but miles-driven trips broadly are back close to where they had been. And so, as we talked about a little bit earlier, we see their frequency return in line with the trends we outlined last quarter coming into this quarter.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of a Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions both on the commercial side. First, can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of pricing in some of your remain lines, specifically, commercial lotto, and then workers comp, have you seen a bottom in [Indiscernible] or is it still soft [Indiscernible]? another one.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yeah. Good morning. Yeah, we continue to see workers' comp, this is Greg by the way, good morning. Workers' comp below the water level and so we had a slight negative with workers comp. Other than that, we continue to be led with excess casualty at Umbrella automobile in property that gives you just a little bit of color, in terms of the range of rate activity from the most positive to least.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then what do you think about inflation affecting loss costs in commercial lines? I think Alan had mentioned last year, assuming loss costs were fairly stable, but have you seen inflation begin to have an impact or do you not think that's a factor on the commercial side?\nAlan Schnitzer: Jimmy, we certainly see it but you've got to start with, what are we seeing relative to our expectations because we certainly expected some levels of inflation. Also on the commercial side, say relative to Personal Insurance, you got to think about the impact on a mix adjusted basis. So you've got the casualty and the property in there. You don't see this cost of goods sold type of inflation so much on the casualty side. And while we did see a little of it on the commercial side, there was an offsetting frequency benefited here; I heard both Greg and David talked about. So it's not that we don't see it, it's not that we're not aware of it, but we expected some and it just doesn't have the same overall impact on that segment.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And if I could just ask one more. On personal auto, I think you were talking about thinking about raising prices on the call last quarter as well, and it doesn't seem like any of that was in your results this quarter. Have you already started implementing price hikes or is it more of the benefit going to flow through in 2022, just given the timing of getting -- often getting permission and then implementing those?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Jimmy. I t's Michael, I think first of all, we would not have expected any rate increases to take effect this quarter. As we talked about it last quarter, where we were beginning to the process of seeking rate which means we've got to put together the filing package, we've got a file that with state, we've got to negotiate with state, we've got to get it approved, We've got an agree upon an effective date which is always in the future from the date you get the approval. So there's a fairly long tail on the front end of any rate filing process up or down. And so we really wouldn't have expected any of those increases to take effect in the third quarter. As I mentioned, we've got 40 plan need over the course of the next three quarters and a couple two or three will likely take effect this month on several, call it another handful will take it back, probably before year end again, all subject to getting approvals from the states that we are working towards those effective dates with. And then the remainder will be in the first or second quarter of next year. The few that we have likely to take effect in the back half of this year will represent 25%, 30% of the written premium volume we have across the country, so it's a relatively small number, but it should be impactful on a written basis, but again, I'll just caution you, it takes time for that to earn into the book. But we've started and we are making progress.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for the call, everyone. I want to ask about social inflation and if you believe on how we should think about the mechanism of regular CPI inflation sweeping into the social inflation side of it. Is it something where we should expect some sort of lag there as courts assess the damages overtime.\nAlan Schnitzer: Paul, good morning. I don't think it's entirely unrelated or uncorrelated, but I think it's less leveraged. I think of social inflation is being driven more by things like aggressive tactics by the plaintiffs bar, and advertising, and litigation finance, things like that. Now, of course, that -- the whole debate on damages, in any case, starts with the underlying compensable damages, and to the extent there's inflation in that, maybe the starting point goes up a little bit, but -- so it's not completely uncorrelated, but also not so leverage.\nPaul Newsome: All right. And then my second question, unrelated auto entire question. There it seems to be efforts in the industry to effectively replace credit scoring with telematics, and that just using together. What do you think of those efforts and is that something that Travelers has a particular view on?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Paul. It's Michael. Certainly, there are conversations that link the two. I guess I'd start by separating the two, right? There are certainly conversations with state regulators and a handful, I would say, that are talking about and/or actively pursuing the removal of credit scoring as a variable on pricing auto insurance. The two most notable are Washington and Colorado. Colorado has a bill that was approved by the state legislature, that's in the rule-making process, around removing credit score in that state. In the state of Washington, again, pretty widely followed, but Commissioner Kreidler issued an emergency rule to ban the use of credit scoring in auto insurance. That rule -- that emergency rule was actually just overturned by a judge in Washington earlier this month. So we're in the process and that -- the overturned by the judge is now being challenged by the commissioners, so there's a back and forth in Washington, those are probably the two most widely viewed views on credit scoring. As respects credit scoring and telematics, what we would say is, first of all, credit is a powerful variable and pricing auto insurance, it's very predictive off claim experience. And if you remove it, then you have subsidization in your rate plan between higher-risk drivers and lower-risk drivers. And in fact, in the context of a telematics program, the credit score and the telematics data are powerful together. If you're in a situation where you don't have credit and can't use credit, telematics is very valuable, probably becomes increasingly valuable. And in that kind of a world, we're encouraged by the capability we've got, the tools we have, the success of our IntelliDrive program, and the power that it has in segmenting loss experiencing and helping us segment pricing.\nPaul Newsome: It sounds like you're agnostic to use some [Indiscernible]\nAlan Schnitzer: I wouldn't say we're necessarily agnostic. I think as Michael pointed out, it is highly predictive and, so we support and promote risk-based pricing. But you end up with some subsidization and so it is what it is. The fact is we compete without it in places like California just fine and we'll continue to compete without it. And in that world, having the data and scale to invest in other rating methodologies is important and we think we have that. So I think either way will be just fine.\nPaul Newsome: Thanks folks, appreciate the help.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks Paul.\nPaul Newsome: For your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you for taking my question. Guess what? More personal auto, I apologize. I'm just wondering, it looks like that used car severity peaked in May and then again in September, and vehicle traffic levels seemed to get back to normal by about May. Yet, the 2Q loss ratio on personal auto was materially higher than the RX of the 3Q [Indiscernible] higher than the 2Q loss ratio. Is there any intra -year development in that? What's there between the 2Q and 3Q loss experience you guys had?\nMichael Klein: Josh, I would say the difference is precisely what you just described. You talked about driving levels in May, which is partway through Q2, you talked about severity in May, which has partway through Q2. And so, as we talk about -- in the second quarter, we saw a frequency trending towards the pre-pandemic levels throughout the quarter, which means it was below at the beginning of the quarter. And similarly, some of the severity impacts we've been describing really started to impact the results in the back half of Q2 and into Q3. That's really, I think, what's going on there and there's no interim period, our entry year, adjustment to talk about.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, Josh, it's not a catch-up of our second quarter loss, it looks pretty consistent with where we had coming out of the second quarter. It's really the difference of a full quarter of the higher frequency and severity Q3 versus Q2.\nJosh Shanker: Great, thank you. And your growth looks fairly strong. I think we can all agree that the price is under priced right now. Can you talk about growing your book at a period of time when the price is below rate adequate levels?\nMichael Klein: Sure Josh. Michael again, as we've talked about pretty consistently. Our goal is to profitably grow the portfolio over time. We remain confident in our ability to do so. And again, as we've talked about, really the profit pressure at the moment really is timing. And it's a mismatch between our ability to get rate filed and approved [Indiscernible] relative to the loss experience we're seeing at this point in time, but we expect that's going to align with loss costs over time. We've seen movies like this before, right where, where we've written business, we've grown the business, we've improved the profit on that business we wrote over time and so. That's the path we're headed down. As we do start to put more price in the market, could that impact growth on a go-forward basis? Certainly could. But again, we're comfortable with our ability to profitably grow the auto book over time.\nJosh Shanker: Do you think we're --\nAlan Schnitzer:  [Indiscernible]\nJosh Shanker: Yeah. Go ahead, please.\nAlan Schnitzer: Just to put a finer point on that, we had this experience a few years ago in personal lines and we ended up with a larger book of very profitable business, and we would expect this to play out in exactly the same way. So very pleased with the volume we are putting on.\nJosh Shanker: I'll leave it at that, and thank you.\nMichael Klein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had just a quick question on the Holdco cash balance. It fell versus last quarter, but still well above your target. I think it was 800 million. Is that still just a function of the debt that you raised? I think it was last quarter. Have you -- you just haven't put that down into the operating companies for growth, or is that sort of excess capital at the Holdco that we can think about to be used for M&A, or share repurchases, or other uses?\nMichael Klein: David, I'm not too terribly worried about cash at the Holdco at any quarters, and we're really looking at overall capital position and still feeling very strong about that and I think you see that in the capital actions that we took this quarter. The decline from where we were, we also because of the strength of the position that we started with didn't need to bring up as much from the underlying companies. We're not signaling anything there with a variability in the holding Company liquidity, we're really just trying to make sure that we've got what we need to cover, and if we've got a little more than that at any point in time, that's fine.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then maybe a question just for Greg. I was a little surprised that the workers' comp net premium written is still down year-over-year. I know you said that the rate is still slightly negative. I guess could you maybe talk about some of the other drivers of the decrease, I would think that there is some wage inflation in there and the exposure base, I would think, is up versus last year. But maybe just talk about the puts intake that takes there and when you think we should start to see some growth in workers' comp net premium written.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yeah, David. Let me give you a bit of color on what's underneath the quarter of number. Clearly, as I said earlier, we still have a slight negative in rates. So that's going to have a large weight, the overall net rate, and premium. We had strong retention overall if there's an area that that brought the number down was on a new business basis. And when we look into the marketplace and particularly larger accounts for this quarter, where we saw the clearing price relative to our price to risk to make sure that we're getting an adequate value over the long term, we didn't hit on some larger deal. So really, it's a functional disciplined underwriting. So the combination of all those drove that minus 3.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Thank you very much. Just quickly on workers' comp, I'm just curious. Are we getting to a point where maybe we start to see underlying loss ratio start to re-stabilize or improve here given rate versus trend, are we still ways away from that happening?\nAlan Schnitzer: You know what? Loss trend has been pretty benign in w workers' comp, but it hasn't been negative, it's been positive, and the rate, the overall pricing has been closer to 0, so below that. if you look at a calendar-year basis, that was being equal yet expect some compression. Of course, we've had a lot of prior-year development so the line has been on a -- is been -- if you look back and actually we're more profitable than we would have predicted the time. And we would have predicted some quarters ago that we would have hit a bottom and made a turn. But again, we've had pretty good results in that line throughout the pandemic and so, I think the outlook is probably going to continue to bounce around, call it 0ish for a little bit longer before it makes a turn. But it will. It'll bounce around, but it will make a turn and go north from there.\nBrian Meredith: Great. And then, just quickly, I know you talked a little bit about cyber and all that's going on there with respect to tightening terms and conditions and rate, etc. I think you said that you're declining in cyber right now. I would've thought this would be a really good time there to maybe stepping the accelerate a little bit and drive some more growth in cyber to maybe give us a little bit more perspective on what's going on there.\nAlan Schnitzer: Jeff, you want to take that?\nJeff Klenk: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Brian. Cyber flow remained strong and consistent with broader demand in the marketplace, including first-time buyers. Like I mentioned earlier in this elevated risk environment, our hit ratios are understandably down given those dynamics. We've tightened underwriting requirements. Like multi-factor authentication, like I mentioned, we're also aggressively pursuing needed rate on both new and renewal. So that's the dynamic that's still out there in the market in our results.\nBrian Meredith: Got you. So you just pushing harder than the rest of the market. Is that what it is or are people just not buying as much?\nMichael Klein: You know, it's just a combination of, we're pushing consistent with our strategies and others are executing on their strategies, but it's pretty well known how the cyberdynamic has been in the marketplace.\nAlan Schnitzer: Brian, I would also add two things. One, we've been very, very disciplined about enforcing minimum cyber hygiene and I don't know that other markets are necessarily as disciplined about that. So when that business leaves us, it's presumably going somewhere. And given the profitability challenges in that line, we're just fine with that.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks, I really appreciate you're fitting me in. Michael, can you update us on severity trends in personal auto liability? We've talked a lot about the physical damage side, I just wanted to get a sense of what's going on liability side.\nMichael Klein: Sure, Meyer. I would say we talked a lot about property damage and liability because that's the place where it's really elevated relative to our expectations. I think on the personal line side, there are certainly is a loss trend in bodily injury liability, but it's much closer to what we would have expected.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. And a brief follow-up, if possible. I just was hoping I could tease or parse out that 2 points that Greg had talked about between the weather-related losses and the PI. I'm sorry, and the COVID impact.\nMichael Klein: I understand that the risk of getting to o granular, we'd rather not parse that out. You could think of them as being fairly equal in terms of their contribution.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have time for just one more question and we'll take that question from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you for fitting me in. Just really quickly on the commentary of that net favorable impact to COVID on Business Insurance. I'm looking here at 10Q and it looks like Travelers benefited from reduced claims settlement activities largely due to the disruption in the judicial system related to COVID-19. So how much of that thought process played into your underlying VI combined ratio improvements this quarter? And could you contextualize how that may change going forward?\nDan Frey: And Tracy, it's Dan. So really what you're seeing in the current quarter is the impact on commercial auto, and that's a frequency event. So I think what we'd expect there over time is we get to a full post-pandemic recovery. If things go back to the way that we're pre-pandemic, I don't think we'd expect that frequency benefit to persist. I think the language -- we could take it offline, but I think the language you're reading out of the queue is more specific to the cash flows related to the operations in the quarter, and that would be lower claim payments. If you look at paid to encourage on a year-to-date basis, it's almost identical to where paid-to-incurred was on a year-to-date basis for the first 9 months of last year, when we were talking about the fact that ports were closed and it was taking a long time to get settlements out the door.\nTracy Benguigui: That's helpful. Also, Greg mentioned that you've focused on your deductibles, attachment points, supplements, and exclusion, and that's also really important, rather than just looking at a blunt rate direction discussion. Could you just let me know your view of loss trend or rate adequacy that's driving those underwriting decision in which business lines, those actions are the most evident?\nMichael Klein: Tracy, I'm not exactly sure what you're trying to get at with that. I think the point we were trying to make is, we are always very disciplined underwriters, starting with risk selection and then evaluating the terms of every single deal that we underwrite, paying attention to all the levers that contribute to price per unit of risk. And so I think that's the point we were trying to make. Those -- that's important. It's not overpowering to the results in any quarter, but those things compound over time. And to the extent that we are making those types of changes on an individual risk, it will improve the price per unit of risks that's not apparent in the production statistics. And also, that tends to unwind more slowly than read online s over time. But I don't think we meant to make more of it than that.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. So it sounds like just normal course of the business. I appreciate you taking my questions.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Tracy.\nOperator: At this time, I will turn the call back over to Ms. Goldstein for any closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your time and as always, if there's any follow-up, feel free to reach out directly to get [Indiscernible]. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes this conference call.

And now, I would like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report excellent underwriting investment results for the second quarter and first half of the year. Core income for the quarter was $879 million or $3.45 per diluted share, generating a total return on equity of 13.7%. In terms of underwriting results, higher underlying underwriting income and net favorable prior-year reserve development, as well as the lower level of catastrophe losses, all contributed to higher core income. Underlying underwriting income was 8% higher than in the prior quarter driven by record net earned premiums of $7.6 billion and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. We are particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals of each of our three business segments. In Business Insurance, net earned premiums were higher and the underlying combined ratio improved by 3.7 points and the Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, both delivered meaningful increases in net earned premiums and continued strong margins. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $682 million after-tax, reflecting very strong returns on our non-fixed income portfolio. These excellent results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 13% over the past year after making important investments for the future and returning significant excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $625 million of excess capital to shareholders including $401 million of share repurchases. Turning to the top-line, the combination of the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners, together with excellent execution by our field organization produced terrific results. During the quarter we grew net written premiums to $8.1 billion, an increase of 11% or 8% after adjusting for the audit premium refunds in the prior year quarter. Each of our three segments contributed meaningfully to the top-line growth. In Business Insurance net written premiums grew by 5% driven by retention which ticked up almost a point in renewal premium change at a near record high 9.5% and 9% growth in new business. Combination of strong pricing and high retention reflects continuing strength in the pricing environment. Inside of renewal premium change, pure renewal rate change was a strong 7.1%. Greg will share more detail about the texture underneath renewal rate change in a few minutes. Renewal premium change also included the highest exposure growth we've seen in nine quarters, and encouraging sign of improvement in U.S. economic activity. In Bond & Specialty insurance, net renewal premiums increased by 15%, driven by record renewal premium change of 12.7% in our management liability business, while retention remained strong. In our commercial businesses, written pricing continues to comfortably outpace estimated loss trend, which will continue to benefit margins as it runs in. Continuing strong pricing and retentions reflect the industry's clear eye view of the ongoing headwinds impacting returns to the industry, including weather volatility, low interest rates and social inflation. We expect pricing to continue to outpace loss trends for some time. Turning to Personal Insurance, production was again excellent this quarter. Net written premiums increased 8% after adjusting for the other premium refunds in the prior year quarter. Policies in-force in both auto and homeowners are at record levels driven by continued strong retention and growth in new business. While the impact of the pandemic and claim frequency seems to be attracting a lot of attention when it comes to personal auto. We've been equally focused on time accompanied by Perform and Transform Mandate to this business. We are very pleased with the results. We've accelerated our domestic other policies in force growth from 1% to 4% over the last six quarters bringing PIP count to a record high. This demonstrates the ongoing success of our three-pronged strategy in Personal Insurance to meet customers where they are, serve them how they want and give them what they need. Going forward we will continue to invest in advanced segmentation also channel distribution and provide great experiences to continue to deliver profitable growth. Michael will share more detail in a few minutes. Our excellent top and bottom line results this quarter for the first half of the year demonstrate the continued successful execution of our strategy to grow the top-line at attractive returns, as well as the effectiveness of our well defined and consistent investment philosophy. Our focused and well executed innovation agenda has been an important contributor to the growth and profitability we have achieved. We will continue to relentlessly pursue our priorities of extending our lead and risk expertise, providing great experiences to our customers, distribution partners and employees and improving productivity and efficiency. With the momentum we have and the best talent in the industry, we are well-positioned to continue to create meaningful shareholder value over time. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the second quarter was $879 million compared to a core loss of $50 million in the prior year quarter. The significant improvement was the result of positive factors across the business, including a lower level of catastrophe losses, improved results in our non-fixed income investment portfolio, more favorable prior year reserve development and increased underwriting income. Our second quarter results include $475 million of pre-tax Cat losses compared to $854 million from last year's second quarter. This quarter's cash were somewhat below what we have assumed for typical second quarter, but year-to-date Cat losses are still above what we would have assumed given the high level of losses in the first quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have accumulated about $1.5 billion of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention of $1.9 billion on a property to aggregate catastrophe XOL Treaty. The treaty provides $350 million of coverage on the first $500 million losses above aggregate retention in a month. Underlying underwriting income increased 8% to $617 million pre-tax reflecting a higher level of earned premium in each of our segments and a strong underlying combined ratio of 91.4% consistent with the prior year. As you'll hear from Greg, Tom and Michael, improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. Some of the increase in Personal Insurance was expected given that last year's quarter benefited from unusually low auto losses as a result of the pandemic. The underlying loss ratio came in at 61.7%, up 1.3 points from last year's second quarter as the beneficial impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend was more than offset by the comparison to a very low pandemic related personal auto loss ratio in the year ago quarter. Expense ratio of 29.7% is 1.3 points lower than the prior year quarter, as last year's result was elevated primarily due to the premium refunds we provided to our personal auto customers. Turning to prior-year reserve development, in Personal Insurance, both auto and property losses came in better than expected from recent accident years resulting in $65 million of pre-tax net favorable PYD. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, $44 million of pre-tax net favorable PYD was driven by favorable loss experienced in Surety and Fidelity related to recent accident years. In Business Insurance, net favorable prior year reserve development of $73 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experienced in Workers Comp across multiple accident years partially offset by reserve strengthening at our run-off book . Net investment income improved to $682 million after tax this quarter. Our non-fixed income portfolio turned in particularly strong results this quarter reflecting performance in the equity markets contributing $265 million after tax. Consistent with our expectations, fixed income returns were down slightly from the prior year quarter as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by a decline in yields. For the remainder of 2021, we expect fixed income NII including earnings from short-term securities of between $425 million and $435 million after-tax per quarter. Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.8 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion. During the second quarter we took advantage of favorable market conditions and raised $750 million to help fund future growth with a 30-year debt issuance at 3.05% representing our second lowest 30-year coupon ever and achieving one of the highest spreads ever for a 30-year note issued by an insurance company. The market value of the bonds in our portfolio generally rose as US treasury yields declined and credit spreads tightened during the second quarter and accordingly our after-tax net unrealized investment gain increased from $2.8 billion as of March 31, to $3.2 billion at June 30. Adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $103.88 at quarter end up 4% since year-end and up 13% year-over-year. We returned $625 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter with $24 million in dividends and $401 million in share repurchases. Coming back to reinsurance for a moment, let me direct your attention to Slide 20 of the webcast presentation for a summary of our July 1 renewals. The structure of our main Cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior year. We've renewed our Northeast Cat Treaty back on July 01 on substantially similar terms and pricing that was up only slightly on an exposure adjusted basis. Our Cat bond 1.3 [ph] is now in the final year of its four-year term. In the annual reset for the 2021 hurricane season, the attachment point was adjusted from $1.87 billion to $1.98 billion while the total cost of the program was flat year-over-year. A more complete description of our Cat reinsurance coverage, including our general Cat aggregate XOL treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our 10-Q which we filed earlier today and in our 2020 Form 10-K. Before turning the call over to Greg, I'd like to make a few comments about inflation as the consumer price index has gotten a lot of attention lately. We are relatively less leveraged to overall CPI type inflation as compared to say medical inflation and social inflation. One place CPI type inflation can impact us is in our short tail lines. Notwithstanding our strong profitability in PI as you'll hear from Michael, we are experiencing a degree of elevated severity. However, relatively short tail periods and short tail lines limit the impact of that exposure and although it takes time to earn in over the policy period, we can price for those increases reasonably quickly. Additionally, it is important to remember that we have some natural hedges in our business that mitigate the effects of inflation. First, higher inflation is often associated with stronger economic activity as most higher wages and asset values, all of which contribute to higher insurance exposures. And as we've discussed before, higher exposure contributes to improved margins. Second, although we're not seeing it at the moment, to the extent interest rates are correlated to inflation, we would benefit from higher returns on our investment portfolio as inflation increases. Finally, when we reiterate that we are conscious of the inflation environment and the uncertainties surrounding it when we establish our loss rates [ph] and our balance sheet reserves. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks Dan. Business Insurance had a great quarter with strong financial results and terrific execution in the marketplace. Segment income was $643 million for the quarter compared to a loss of $58 million in the prior year quarter. Higher net investment income, lower catastrophe losses, higher underlying underwriting incomes and favorable prior year reserve development, all contributed to the year-over-year improvement. We're particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.3% which improved by 3.7 points from the second quarter of 2020, primarily attributable to three things. First, about 2 points of the improvement resulted from earned pricing exceeding loss cost trends. Another capital point reserve resulted from lower non-Cat weather. And third, the improvement also reported the comparison to the modest net charge we took in the prior year quarter related to the pandemic. In terms of non-Cat weather, while the year-over-year improvement was about 0.5 point favorable as I've just mentioned, this quarter's result was about 1.5 better than what we assumed for the quarter. Turning to the top-line, net written were up 5% benefiting from strong renewal premium change including both strong renewal rate and the exposure levels that are trending back to pre-pandemic levels and higher year-over-year new business volume. As for domestic production, renewal premium change was 9.5%, but historically higher result and up almost 4 points from the second quarter of last year. Underlying the RPC, we achieved strong renewal rate change of 7.1% and healthy exposure growth that reflects improving trends in our customers outlook for their businesses. As Alan said, our ability to continue to achieve historically high pricing with improved retention, speaks to the stability of pricing in the markets. New business was up more than 9% with both select and middle markets contributing. I'll discuss those results in more detail in a moment when I get to the individual businesses. We are very pleased with these aggregate production results and our marketplace execution. We've generated written pricing that has been in excess of estimated loss trend for some time now resulting in significant improvement in the profitability of our [indiscernible]. For this quarter renewal rate change of 7.1% remains well in excess of loss trend, it was a little over sequentially. Let me provide a little more context around that. A substantial majority of the decrease is attributable to a rational moderating of rate in our two specialty business units. Excess Casualty, which is inside Middle Market and National Property. The more recent comes after three years of very strong compounding rate increases in these two businesses. So the tempering of rate is appropriate concerning the improved return profile. Also while renewal rate change was down sequentially for those businesses, rate increases were still in double-digit. More broadly, the rate increases we are seeing across Business Insurance continue to be stable and widespread across both our lines of business and our distribution of accounts. As demonstrated on Slide 12, in our Middle Market and National Property businesses we achieved rate increases at 84% of the accounts that renewed in the second quarter, up from 81% in last year's second quarter. Given persistent loss pressures and low fixed income yields, we will continue to seek rates to further improve our margins. We will also continue to focus on all of the non-rate levers to improve the risk profile and profitability across our portfolio. For example, in our National Property business, our underwriters continue to focus on improving terms and conditions transaction by transaction. Changes in terms like increased deductibles, management of supplement [ph] and reinsurance optimization are meaningful tools in enhancing our profitability and our underwriters continue to be active in utilizing all those levers. As for the individual businesses in select renewal rate change was 4.3%, more than 2 points higher than the second quarter of 2020, while retention was 80%. These results reflect deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of the business and we're pleased with the progress we're making in this regard. Exposure growth was up over 4% for the quarter which is an encouraging sign as they come into our business. Lastly, new business was up 6% over the prior year quarter driven by the continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product which is now live in 31 states. This state-of-the-art product includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast easy quoting experience. We are encouraged with our agents' adoption of the new product as both submissions and new policies are up. In Middle Market renewal premium change of over 9% and retention of 87% were both historically high. Renewal rate change at 7.4% remained strong and well in excess of loss trend. Finally, new business was up 16% over the prior year quarter driven by success with larger accounts as well as some improvement in the quality of the flow in the market. As always we remain disciplined around risk selection and underwriting. To sum up, Business Insurance had a terrific quarter by all measures. We're pleased with our execution and further improving the underlying margins in the BOP and we continue to invest in the business for long term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Kunkel: Thanks Greg. Bond & Specialty posted excellent returns and growth in the quarter. Segment income was $187 million, considerably more than double the prior year quarter, driven by favorable prior-year reserve developments and significantly improved underlying underwriting margin and higher business volumes. The underlying combined ratio of 83.4 improved by over 3.5 points from the prior year quarter as pricing that exceeded loss cost trends drove a lower underlying loss ratio. Turning to the top-line, net written premiums grew an exceptional 16% in the quarter with solid contributions from all our businesses. In management liability, renewal premium change was a record 12.7%, driven by near record rate. Retention remained strong at 86%. New business increased 6% from the second quarter of last year, our first quarterly increase since the beginning of the pandemic with strong new business pricing. Surety also grew for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic and international again posted meaningful growth including strong retention and rate. So Bond & Specialty results were excellent and reflect our ability to successfully manage this business through a variety of business and economic cycles. And now I'll turn it over to Michael for Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thanks Tom and good morning everyone. We're very pleased with our second quarter Personal Insurance results. Segment income of $121 million was up $111 million from the prior year quarter, benefitting from lower catastrophes, higher net investment income and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Partially offsetting these improvements was a lower underlying underwriting gain which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. Our second quarter combined ratio improved from the prior year quarter by about 1.5 points to 99.7%. Net written premiums grew 16%. Recall that in the prior year quarter we provided $216 million of premium refunds to automobile customers in response to the impact of the pandemic. Adjusting for these premium refunds, net written premiums grew a very strong 8% with domestic homeowners up 12% and domestic automobile up 4%. Automobile delivered another excellent quarter with a combined ratio of 91.6%. The underlying combined ratio was an impressive 92%, although up 6 points from the prior year quarter, which reflected lower loss activity during the initial months of the pandemic. The current quarter results reflect the benefits of modestly lower claim frequency compared to pre-pandemic levels. As we exited the quarter, claim frequency was closer to pre-pandemic levels and we would expect that trend to continue into the third quarter. Our strong current quarter profitability also reflects increased severity, particularly in collision and third-party physical damage claims driven primarily by higher costs of used vehicles and parts. As auto loss experience approaches pre-pandemic levels, we plan to begin filing for rate increases in selected states later this year, as we continue to balance business volumes and profitability. While it will take some time for future rate actions to earn into our results, we are well positioned to continue to profitably grow in auto. In homeowners and other, the second quarter combined ratio of 108.3% was six points lower than the prior year quarter, driven by a 13.5 point reduction in catastrophe losses. Partially offsetting the catastrophe favorability was an 8 point increase in the underlying combined ratio. Approximately 1/3 of this increase reflects non-catastrophe weather losses which were in line with our expectations, but elevated over a less active prior year quarter. The remainder of the increase reflects continued elevated frequency and severity of fire and non-weather water losses. The increased severity we saw in the second quarter includes higher repair costs due to a combination of labor and material increases. We continue to see great increases in response to these trends, and will continue to actively monitor inflation and loss cost trend changes to factor them into our pricing and underwriting decisions. Turning to quarterly production, domestic automobile retention was up slightly to a strong 85%, new business increased by 19% and policies in-force grew 4%. Domestic homeowners and other delivered another excellent quarter with retention remaining strong at 85%, renewal premium change increasing to 8.2%, and new business growth of 28% reflective of increased quote activity and increase in average premium, along with the ongoing successful rollout of Quantum Home 2.0. Policies in force grew 7%. As Alan mentioned, our policies in-force growth across both auto and homeowners are at record levels. Actually, our policies in-force across both auto and homeowners are at record levels, reflecting our ongoing effort to perform and transform in Personal Insurance. When we launched Quantum Auto 2.0 we designed it with a modular product structure to give customers what they need and to deliver long-term performance. This has enabled us to seamlessly introduce new rating variables such as vehicle history, prior insurance history and telematics, allowing us to continually improve our pricing segmentation. Regarding telematics, we've seen take-up rates for IntelliDrive increase by 30% since the launch of our second generation offering, which features a fully redesigned mobile experience, monitors distracted driving and improves our ability to match price to driving behavior. Our momentum in auto aligns very well with our goal of providing total account solutions for customers. The Quantum Home 2.0 product is now available in over 40 states, generating consistent growth and policies in-force, while distributors and customers continue to see value in our combined auto and property offerings. Our multichannel PI distribution strategy allows us to meet our customers where they are. As a result of the success of our new products, our existing relationships continue to perform well. Additionally, we've seen more demand for agent appointments, which is contributing meaningfully to our growth. In order to serve customers how they want to be served, we are also investing in our digital capabilities. With the advancements in our MyTravelers mobile app, we continue to digitize the customer journey with over 600,000 customers already downloading the app since it launch earlier this year. Going forward, we will continue to invest in solutions that meet customers where they are, give them what they need, and serve them how they want while working with our distribution partners to deliver profitable growth. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael. Before we open it up for Q&A, I'd like to turn the call back over to Alan for a moment.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Abbe. As bittersweet as it is, we have one last piece of business this morning before we turn to Q&A. I want to acknowledge and thank our partner and friend, Tom Kunkel will be retiring in September after a spectacular 37-year career at Travelers and to impact as the leader of our very successful Surety and Management Liability businesses has been profound. In addition to delivering exceptional financial results over many years, Tom and his leadership team fostered a culture of care, community and excellence that extends throughout our Bond & Specialty organization and throughout Travelers. It's one of the many reasons why I'm so pleased with Jeff Klenk, currently a member of Tom's leadership team and Head of our Management Liability business will succeed Tom. Jeff has been Travelers for more than 20 years. He's a proven leader and the perfect candidate to take up the reins from Tom. You'll hear from Jeff in October on our third quarter earnings call. Tom, we're all going to miss you personally and professionally. And with that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Phillips: Thank you, and good morning everybody. I want to drill first, I guess, Michael, in some of your comments on personal auto and your comment, I think towards the end, you said you'll begin to file some rate increases later in the year. A question kind of centered around the timing of that frequency benefit for you seemed to be lasting a little bit longer than some of your peers. Maybe that's some mix of business issue that you might have a little more preferred. Maybe you can confirm that. But what's driving -- if frequency is starting to come back to pre-pandemic levels, and you expect that to continue, I guess why not take rate now, why wait till later in the year and what's driving that need for rate, if it's not frequency and maybe it is, is it more of the severity? So kind of a couple pronged question there, but more on the timing of the rate, why not now? And then really kind of what's driving it? Is it more of the frequency or severity that's driving your need for rate? Thank you.\nMichael Klein: Sure, Michael. Thanks for the question. Really, the timing is really just a function of the process. We're actively putting together, filing packages and engaged in conversations with State Insurance Departments as we speak. So it's not a question of waiting to get rate. It's just a function of the process of working with regulators to get rate increases filed and approved. And to your question about frequency and severity, again I think in my comments about the quarter in particular, we're seeing frequency coming out of the quarter returning more towards pre-pandemic levels and we are seeing severity pressure, I flagged out some of the physical damage pressures and I can give you just a quick example there, right? You've all seen the news about used car prices being up 50%. That particularly impacts us in the case of total losses, where the average cash value of that total loss is up pretty significantly. There's a little bit of an offsetting good guy there, because we get more for the salvage recovery on that total vehicle. But net-net that's putting upward pressure on severity and that's one example total -- cost to repair vehicles is up while the injury severity is also got upward pressure on it. So we're responding really to both frequency and severity to answer your question on the drivers.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, that's helpful Mike and maybe just a follow up on that. If the timing, you say is more of a process, it sounds like you'd rather do something sooner rather than later. Does the, I mean, your margins today in the second quarter, were still better than 2Q 2020, 2Q 2019 I'm sorry, still better than pretty good, but you expect things to change. So -- with margins still better do you expect much of a pushback from anybody at the state level to say, you guys, and maybe some of the industry still have really good profit here. So that might be a bit of a push back on, I don't know how much you expect to get from rate, but there might be some pushback on the ability to get rate that you want given pretty decent returns still?\nMichael Klein: Yes, Michael, I think it's a -- I think it's a great observation and it is part of that process that I described is really a conversation with regulators about what the historical experience has been. But also pointing out that part of that favorable experience is really due to the extraordinary event that was the thing that is the pandemic. And so we're in conversations with them about how to weight historical experience versus prospective views of trend. And also, state-by-state experience varies and our starting point varies by state. We've talked in prior quarters about the fact that we did take rate reductions in over 20 states across the country. And so those are certainly some of the places we're looking initially to see if we could take some of that rate back, which is a different conversation maybe than in the state where we didn't file a rate increase historically. So again, great observation and really all part of that process that we're engaging in as we speak.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, Michael, thank you very much for the details. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can you guys hear me?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes.\nRyan Tunis: Sorry about that, just got back to the office today, so getting used to the old phone. So I just wanted to keep it on personal auto, when we think about where you're seeing some of the elevated loss trend, Michael, is it more geographic or is it preferred versus more standard? I mean, like what are kind of the variables that you're looking at the most to kind of think about? Where you're seeing loss trying to come back the most?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, great question, Ryan and good morning. Welcome back to the office. We are seeing it, there are variations across geographies. We look at things like return to normal indices. We look at driving data by state and by geography. But broadly speaking, most areas of the country are seeing driving activity return again to a close to a pre-pandemic levels, closer in some places than others. We also continue to monitor as we've talked about the past, commuting miles versus non-commuting miles. And there is still a different mix of miles today than there has been historically, but when you put all that together, and you look at clean frequency, the frequency benefits we saw and that's part of my comment about as we exited the quarter, the frequency benefits we've seen over the past few months and quarters, have started to wane and wanes throughout the second quarter, which is part of our comment about trends returning to pre-pandemic levels.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And I guess my follow up is one the home side. So the home attritional loss ratio is above 60. That's clearly somewhat elevated. But we've seen the price of something like lumber, timber is come down quite a bit since mid 2Q, how much of an alleviating factors should we think about that moving forward in terms of the type of pressure that's putting on the loss ratio on home, or was putting on the loss ratio on home?\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure. It's a great question Ryan. I would say a couple things. First, in my remarks I did talk about frequency and severity and particularly, frequency and severity of fire and non-weather water losses driving some of that underlying deterioration. So clearly, the lumber prices are a severity item, not a frequency item and we are seeing, we did see uptick in the quarter in both. I would take just a quick step back as we're talking about auto and property though and just make a couple of observations and then come back and finish the answer to your question. If you take a step back and look at the segment combined ratio on both an overall and an underlying basis, it's very consistent with the long run average for this business. And when you look at the Auto combined ratio, not surprisingly in the quarter, it still ran below the long term average. And in property in the quarter, the combined ratio is, call it, 4 to 6 points above those long-term averages on a total and an underlying basis. So that just sort of gives you a little bit of an order of the magnitude of what we're talking about here. I'd also remind you that property, in property, the combined ratio, the highest combined ratio we see in the year is the second quarter. So you got to sort of put the second quarter into context. But that said, the severity pressure we saw on the quarter was a combination of labor and materials. So certainly the 50% plus increase in the lumber are in there. Double-digit increase in roofing materials is in there. High single-digit to low double-digit increases in labor is in there. And when we look at our property loss cost mix, it's really labor followed by contents, followed by materials. So even if the short answer to your question I think is even if lumber prices come back down, that's still a relatively small component of the loss costs. But we do see period-to-period volatility in frequency and severity in attritional office property. So, again, that's part of why I gave you that long run view of where the quarter was relative to history. And at the end of the day, we take a step back, and we look at the renewal premium change we're driving in property, and our focus really is to continue to drive rate in property to address some of those pressures.\nRyan Tunis: That's really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one is from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to just follow-up a bit more on the on the auto side. So maybe, Michael, I'm just wondering, I guess, obviously you're taking rate, but how are you thinking about balancing taking rate versus what could be maybe short lived severity increases or is the view that these increases in severity that you're witnessing are not transitory and might be more sustainable?\nMichael Klein: Yes, it's a great question. And certainly, as we've talked about severity trend over time, we've pretty consistently talked about the fact that, that we take a long run view of trend when we set our prices. Now, if the starting point is elevated, because we've seen an uptick in severity, and that's in our loss costs, the question is, is your starting point elevated and are you training off that elevated starting point? Or is your experience you're seeing or is the experience we're seeing in this quarter an anomaly? I think if I broke apart frequency and severity for you, I'd say again, we continue to see the frequency trending towards the pre-pandemic level that's continuing. How much of the auto materials cost, physical damage cost inflation is transitory or not, is a key question. And, there's a lot of varying opinions around that and we'll factor our best estimate into that assessment as we factor in what we think we need to rate on a go forward basis.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, let me just add to that, weather inflation, our view on weather inflation is transitory. We're certainly looking out over the duration of the liability. So what we're talking about CPI type inflation, again lumber, used cars, et cetera, that's impacting your relatively short tail line. So we don't really have to forecast long term in that case. And because it's short tail, the claim activity comes in pretty quickly, we see it reasonably quickly and we can react to it pretty quickly.\nMichael Klein: Yes. Great point, Alan.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. That makes sense, that's helpful. And then maybe a question for Alan just on the investment in Fidelis. I was hoping maybe you could elaborate on the thought process behind that, and maybe sort of the thinking around your own non admitted offering and sort of aspirations there?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, thanks. Thanks for that question. We've got a fair amount of interest in this, which I'm thrilled to have any interest in, we're interested in it as well. Let me just put it in a little bit of context. As you can infer from the fact that we didn't disclose terms it is not a material investment for us. So I think that's just important background to start with. But having said that, when we think about investment activities, we're and as we said, we're interested in things that provide some strategic capability. And, we've said for a long time that we're underweight E&S and this gives us a window into a successful innovative management team that, that has a lot of expertise in the niche, not even non-admitted space. And in progress and geographies that could teach us something as well. So it really is about a learning exercise for us.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one is from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan.\nJamminder Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first, just sort of a question on what you're seeing in the Workers Comp market in terms of pricing? I think there's been an expectation that things would begin to turn are you seeing that? And then I have a follow up.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Good morning, this is Greg. Yes Workers Comp continues to bounce around. We thought that we were going to hit the bottom a couple of quarters back and then with the pandemic, there's clearly been some favorable frequency activity around Workers Comp and bank wages, payrolls, et cetera. As we continue to work with the bureaus in terms of their loss cost recommendations, they are coming in less negative and I think the key will be around how they treat 2020. That's an anomalous year, or if they're going to factor that into the overall ratemaking. So the overall book of business, we didn't quite hit a positive rate number. We were slightly negative in the quarter, but we do see improvement on it every quarter.\nJamminder Bhullar: And then on toward costs and sort of social inflation with sort of the reopening of courts, should we assume that we should start to see a little bit of a pickup in social inflation? And how does that affect your loss ratio and have you been assuming, have you been incorporating continued high social inflation in your loss fix through the past few quarters?\nDan Frey: Hi Jimmy, it is, Dan, I'll take that one. We have taken the view that social inflation has gone nowhere, and that the elevated level of losses that we saw, call it pre-pandemic are going to persist and that the elevated level of loss trend even off of that higher level of losses was going to persist. So that's what we've assumed as we continue to make our loss picks and assess and assess our reserves. And I think it's going to be a while before we see courts work through the backlog of having been closed for much of the past year. Priority in some jurisdictions is going to be given to criminal cases over civil cases, whether the courts are reopening for in-person discussions or virtual is still a question in some jurisdictions. So I think it's going to be a while before we know the answer. I think we said pretty consistently last year that there's uncertainty in that environment and because there's uncertainty, we were taking a cautious view in our view of loss trends and reserves. But the short answer to the question is, we think social inflation is as strong as ever and that's reflected in our numbers.\nJamminder Bhullar: Okay, and then just lastly, I think Alan noted that the fact that you didn't disclose the price on Fidelis means that it wasn't a large investment, should we assume that there should be any impact from the investment on your share buyback plans for this year?\nAlan Schnitzer: Jimmy it\u2019s - and part of our overall capital management strategy, that's not going to be sort of almost by definition, it's not going to have a meaningful impact on our capital position.\nJamminder Bhullar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one is from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Shanker: Yes, good morning, everyone. I just want to talk about, I know there's been a lot of questions on personal auto, but I have one more. You -- this has been the best month for growth in terms of new policies that you guys have seen since back in 2016. Given that you firmly expected frequency to return, is there a risk that you've put on customers who came in because of a good price in the pandemic, but the price won't be adequate price post pandemic and they might leave?\nMichael Klein: Yes, Josh. It\u2019s Michael, I suppose there's always a risk and certainly there's pressure on retention when you start to increase prices. That said, we feel comfortable with the pricing levels that we've been putting business on the books. I mentioned IntelliDrive, as a key driver of some of our growth distribution expansions. It has been a driver of some of our growth, there's a lot of things that you can point to, including elevated quote activity, that are drivers of growth and auto. We've seen some slight improvement in close rate in auto over the past few months, as we've maintained our PC essentially flat. But there are a lot of other drivers of growth than just price that we can point to you that probably alleviates some of that.\nDan Frey: Hey Josh, it's Dan, just want to comment on that. I think we've done a terrific job in the auto book over recent years in terms of understanding our appetite and having a consistent appetite, and I've pointed to the last time we did take significant pricing in auto back in 2017, 2018 timeframe. We did not shrink discount in that environment.\nJoshua Shanker: Good point, good point and an unrelated topic, but sort of interest with the court reopening and whatnot. Can you talk about whether in 2Q you're seeing convergence between model loss cost trends and actual experience? I assume that you prepare for a lot more losses on an incurred basis during the pandemic that didn't occur because of the nature of courts. Is that narrowing right now are we still experiencing loss cost far below the model overall?\nMichael Klein: To make sure I understand the question, Josh, you mean, the trend in the loss ratio or you mean the level of incurred losses relative to ultimate losses?\nJoshua Shanker: I mean, in every line of business, you assume that the loss cost turns to be 4%, 5%, 6%. But during the pandemic, it wasn't that because of courts and other reasons, but you assume that, that's just the delay. Is your loss experience coming closer in line with your model protections? Or are we still have a huge backload of reserves for claims that haven't come through because pandemic conditions persist?\nMichael Klein: Yes, I think closer to the latter. So, we still have, for example, low paid to incur ratios. We still have, for example, the majority of the ultimate losses we recognized were from COVID, sitting in IBNR. And to the earlier question on court reopening, again, I think people are maybe jumping the gun on that. I think it's going to be quite a while before we work through the backlog here and see. So we are still expecting longer periods of development in terms of how long it's going to take to get to ultimate. And again, as we said previously, even though the data itself looked good, we took a cautious view in terms of our loss picks and our reserves, with assumptions more in line with our normal long term loss trend.\nJoshua Shanker: All right, well I'll dig in a little bit later. But I don't want to keep up the line. Thank you very much.\nMichael Klein: Thanks Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one is from Tracy from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Dan, you mentioned that Travelers is less leveraged to overall CPI type inflation. Are there better macroeconomic indicators we should be looking at if CPI is a lesser measure for long tail lines? I have muscle memory from a formal role that there are other indices you look at, that is more nuanced for your businesses to measure claims inflation?\nAlan Schnitzer: Let Tom Kunkel start and Dan can fill in whatever I miss. We're actually not trying to forecast CPI or inflation generally. We're trying to forecast loss costs. And we do that by analyzing our own data and incorporating forecasts from third parties. And we do that on a very granular basis. So, take Workers Comp, for example. We're not forecasting medical inflation. We're looking at components. So, think prescription drug prices, durable medical equipment, et cetera. And we're doing that in the same niche that those lost costs, contribute to our actual losses. So, it's hard, I mean, obviously, we can't give you a single number and it's hard to say, if we go look at this index or that index, because we're doing it on a very granular basis, in part by combining our own data and squaring triangles and by reference to third party sources.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. So all those nuance factor that you're looking at, does that worry with respect to inflation, if CPI is not the indicator we should be super focused on?\nAlan Schnitzer: No, there's nothing about, there's nothing about loss costs or inflation that's worrying us at all. In fact, the way we -- the emphasis in the conversation here is because to a degree, we are seeing it but we saw pretty good profitability and personal lines. And it's into the short term line. And the consequences of that is, we can see it very quickly and react to it very quickly. And contrast that to say social inflation, which was an issue for us a few years ago, where takes a little bit longer for us, although I will say that I think as compared to many we saw that very, very quickly. And there's not nearly as much leverage on the balance sheet. So, there's not as much risk in the reserves, and we can pay for it relatively quickly. So, there's actually nothing at all about the inflation environment that's of concern to us at the moment in short term lines or long term ones.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay, great. Just one follow-up on Fidelis it's also reinsurer, so I'm just wondering if this partnership could look like a sidecar where you can see your own premiums, this platform where could potentially compete what reinsurers on your panel?\nAlan Schnitzer: Certainly not at the moment, not as the way we've contemplated this. It really is just the way we've presented it. It's pretty simple. It's a really interesting business model. It's a fantastic management team. They've got a great track record. There, that the cultures are very compatible. What they do is very interesting to us and we wanted to learn more. And that's for the time being that's really all there is to it. And maybe over time we'll collaborate with them and there will be business opportunities. Who knows, but for the time being, it really is just as we've laid it out.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you for taking my questions.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Tracy.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one is from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Alan, I guess my first question is on the Fidelis investment as well. Through the years, you've said, you guys weren't interested in reinsurance deals. Obviously, there are unique features of this investment away from just reinsurance. But I just want to get a sense of just as we think about M&A, like because your stance on reinsurance changed. And then you guys issued $750 million of debt in the quarter, and it was earmarked for business growth. So, I'm just trying to -- are you tying that capital into potential M&A or is that more earmarked for organic business growth?\nAlan Schnitzer: Let me start with Fidelis and I'll ask Dan to comment on the capital raise. So, there's just nothing at all about this that signals any shift in our thinking about reinsurance. We are primarily focused on being a primary writer with very limited interest in reinsurance and that remains the case it, it just so happens that Fidelis writes some of their business in the form of reinsurance, but that's just one of their four pillars of business. There are some interesting aspects of their reinsurance business. They've got really powerful risk management tools, are really powerful with risk and reward. And so, there's the potential for us to learn something in terms of managing our own cap portfolio. And I will point out why it hasn't been and I don't expected to be any significant focus for us. We do write a little bit of reinsurance where it's complimentary to our core business. So for example, we've got a Boiler Re business. So it's not completely foreign to us. It's a very, very, very small part of what we do. No change in strategic focus. But it's not alarming to us and in this respect, we think that there's something for us to learn.\nDan Frey: And Elyse, regarding the capital, capital question, no change at all in our philosophy or urgency around M&A or lack of urgency around M&A. It's really coincidental the timing of when these things came together. And again, the Fidelis investment was small enough that it wouldn't have necessitated much in the way of capital management anyways, I think if you go back into transcripts, six, or even eight quarters ago, we were talking about, eventually we would have the need to issue more debt just to keep up with growth in the top-line and to maintain the debt-to-capital ratio that we're comfortable with.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thanks. And then my second question on, can you guys quantify the impact that exposure had on your premium growth in the quarter, and then within select accounts within Business Insurance, I noticed that the premiums declined in the quarter, but I thought exposure would have benefited that business line as well.\nDan Frey: So Elyse it's Dan. I'm going to, I guess resist the temptation to sort of try to do a reconciliation of written premiums at the degree that there's positive exposure, the same way that to the degree that there's positive rate, that just means that the accounts that renewed would have renewed at that much more. Having said that, it's applicable to the accounts that renewed, that's the measure that it would apply to. Alan do you want\u2026?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, I mean, just a little bit more color on select. We've shared with you that we've been very focused on improving the profitability of that business. And so, we've certainly been very thoughtful around production and pursuing margin improvement for rates and terms and conditions and that sort. I will tell you also in the Select business, during the pandemic because of some of our ability to have a little more flexibility for a customer, we suspended some billing and some cancellation activity. And now that's back in play in the marketplace, so you have a little bit of drag in the top-line with that just back to normal activity, but when comparing that to the base period that has a little bit of an impact also Elyse.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. The next one is from Brian Meredith from UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. Most of them have been asked. Just I'm curious, wildfires are kind of kicking up here in the West Coast. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what you've kind of been doing over the last couple of years to kind of manage your exposure to wildfires?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Brian, this is Michael and certainly we're managing our exposure to wildfire across the business, but I'll start with Personal Insurance. I think a lot of the actions are common across the place, but Greg can chime in if I miss anything on the commercial line side. It really is a continuation of the conversation that we've been having with you in terms of the way we've been managing it. I think, we've talked a lot about California, in particular, in the context of wildfires, but certainly the parallel is a parallel that exposes us across more states in the West, then just California. So one specific development I would point you to in 2021 is, we've extended our agreement with Wildfire Defense Systems to apply to Colorado in addition to California. So we've got that sort of risk prevention partnership extending across an additional state in the West, which we think on the margin is helpful. And then maybe just an update on our progress in California, in addition to the launch of the new product, which we successfully got in market in 2020, we're now converting California policies to that new product. So think new pricing, segmentation, think new rate level, think new eligibility, as respect to wildfire exposure. And just last month, we got an additional 6.9% rate increase approved on the Property product in the state. So we continue to manage through rate eligibility our terms and conditions. And we do continue to work our way through the non-renewal activity, subject to the lifting of the moratoriums as they expire, as another level we're polling and again, a lot of those are specific California comments, but you can think about those in terms of again, segmentation modeling, exposure management, applying more broadly across the west.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks. I guess, a quick follow up here. Just curious, you continue to have some really strong growth in your commercial property lines, can you talk a little bit about what the kind of market dynamics are in that line? That's the one area that I thought we're seeing pricing really kind of moderate the quickest.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, as you saw we had plus 9% across the property line. And really those are primary amount of growth underneath that is RPC growth. And that's why, we gave you that supplement exhibit where Excess Casualty and National Property were two of our many specialty lines that we have, but two have certainly been the poster children for some REIT momentum over the last couple of years, and as I said, still get in double-digits but moderating, somewhat, but that's what's driving that growth.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one more question and that will be from Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thank you so much for fitting me in. One last -- well, obviously last question on personal auto, can you talk about the trajectory of frequency month-by-month in the second quarter just so we can assess what's going on?\nAlan Schnitzer: Meyer, I don't know if I'm going to give you a numbers more specifically inside the quarter. I think what you said, we'll let stand which is, that as we exited the quarter frequency was closer to pre pandemic levels. You sort of know where it had been running, I think coming into the quarter and again, it approached pre-pandemic levels as we left the quarter.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, fair enough. And then I guess this is for Greg. When we look at the presentation on Select accounts, the RPC for the first quarter of 2021 showed up as 8.8%. When you actually reported 1Q, it was 6.7. That seems from the outside like a big change. I thought you could talk about the process, and how we should think about the inherent estimates in the RPC?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Meyer both of those quarters, both the fourth quarter and the first quarter developed up, as you said, about 2 points. And I'll just remind you, that's an estimate of what we believe the current force is going to look like in terms of the exposure growth. So we're always estimating that and when you have a V impact in the economy, your models sometimes don't keep up with that really quick and adroit change that's happening. So we basically shorten the model period. So if we were using a six-month moving average, think we moved to a three-month moving average to try to keep up with that change in the marketplace. And that gives us a little bit changed the development. So we think we'll be in front of that going forward, but that was basically the methodology underneath that.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That's exactly what we needed, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Ms. Abbe Goldstein, please continue.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much. I appreciate everyone's time and for joining us this morning, and as always, if there are any follow-up questions get in touch with Investor Relations and good day everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplements and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report, first quarter core income $699 million or $2.73 per diluted share, both up from the prior year quarter. Despite our highest ever level of first quarter catastrophe losses. A higher level of core income for the quarter was driven by very strong underlying underwriting income, as well as higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income. All of which more than offset the record level of catastrophe losses. Underlying underwriting income of $735 million pre-tax was nearly 25% higher than in the prior year quarter, driven by an increase in net earned premiums to $7.4 billion and an underlying combined ratio which improved almost two points to an excellent at 89.5%. We are particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all the three of our business segments. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio improved by more than three points, which again included the benefit of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend. On Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, both benefited from higher earned premiums and continued strong margins. Turning to investments, our high quality investment portfolio continue to perform well, generating net investment income of $590 million after-tax for the quarter, up 14% from the prior year quarter. These results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 9% over the past year, after making important investments in our business and returning excess capital to shareholders. During the quarter we returned $613 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $397 million of share repurchases. In recognition of our strong financial position, confidence in our business. I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a 4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.88 per share, marking 17th consecutive years of dividend increases, with the compound annual growth rate of 9% over that period. Our Board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases. Turning to production, we remain pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies. During the quarter we grew net written premiums by 2% to $7.5 billion. Our premium growth once again reflects strong renewal premium change and retention in each of our three segments. In Business Insurance, renewal premium change increased to 9.2%. Its highest level since 2013 and four points higher than the prior year quarter. While retention remains strong. Workers compensation, pure renewal rate change was slightly negative, but continued on an improving trend. Workers comp renewal premium change, which includes exposure was positive for the first time in a number of quarters. Both renewal rate change, annual premium change in every other product line, were near or above recent record highs. Net written premiums in business insurance were down a little bit year-over-year, driven overwhelmingly by the workers comp product line, primarily reflecting the impact of the pandemic on payrolls. As we're comparing a pandemic impacted quarter in the current year, to a largely pre pandemic quarter in the prior year. Bond & Specialty Insurance net written premiums increased by 9%. Driven by renewal premium change of nearly 11% in our management liability business, while retention remained strong. Across our commercial businesses, the pricing environment continues to be rational and favorable, with written pricing well above estimated loss cost trends. Overall pricing levels continue to be near record levels and while margins have improved, given the continued headwinds impacting returns for the industry. We expect pricing to continue to outpace loss trend for some time. Turning to Personal Insurance, production was excellent in the quarter. Net written premiums increased by nearly 7%, driven by renewal premium change of almost 8% in our homeowners business, strong retention in new business in both auto and home. New business for both auto and home combined was up 17% compared to the prior year quarter, which is the ninth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in new business, demonstrating the ongoing success of our product, distribution and customer initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Dan, given the elevated frequency and severity of catastrophes in recent years, including the recent severe winter weather, I'd like to take a minute and highlight the work we've done in terms of the strategic management of our catastrophe exposure. Some number of years ago when consistent with our approach generally of recognizing, assessing and addressing trends rapidly, we took decisive action in anticipation of continued whether volatility. Our efforts started with talent. We got an experts in data science, meteorology, geophysics, and environmental engineering, among others, for our Cat Management organization. We also established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril, with the goal of developing industry leading scientific and underwriting expertise. We have incorporated the results into our product development, risk selection, pricing, capital allocation and claim response. The insights we have developed have enabled us to supplement standard vendor cat models, with our own sophisticated peril-by-peril view. This gives us a refined granular view of cat risk, incorporating proprietary variables such as complex route characteristics, tree and brush density, and location intelligence down to the parcel level. These variables are incorporated into our product developed enhancing segmentation. They're also integrated into proprietary algorithms that we use at the point of sale, to inform risk selection and decisions about terms and conditions. Those of our claim response, our data scientists and other experts have developed geospatial tools, artificial intelligence and analytic models to facilitate a more effective tailored deployment claim resources. This has resulted in a more satisfying experience for our customers and a more efficient outcome for us. Taken together these efforts have enabled us to more effectively manage our exposure to catastrophes. While there's always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event. Over the past five years, our share of property catastrophe losses relative to total property catastrophe losses for the domestic P&C industry has declined significantly, compared to the five years prior to that. Our property cat losses over the past five years have also been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share. Advancing our understanding of the risk and reward of catastrophe underwriting is an ongoing effort for us. As a footnote, but importantly, we've made these and other strategic investments in our business while we improved our expense ratio. So to sum up, the strength of our underwriting and investment expertise enabled us to deliver strong profitability in this quarter, notwithstanding the severe winter weather. As a result, we're off to a terrific start for the year. We're particularly pleased with the strong underlying fundamentals in all three of our business segments. Our proven strategy, strong track record of execution, leading analytics, talent advantage, give us confidence that we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the economy recovers. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $699 million, up from $676 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 11.1%. Increase in core income resulted primarily from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development, improved underlying underwriting results and increased net investment income, largely offset by a much higher level of catastrophe losses. Our first quarter results include $835 million of pre-tax cat losses, an all-time high for our first quarter cats and an increase the $502 million compared to last year's first quarter. This quarter cats include $703 million from the February winter storms, which impacted Texas and a number of other states. Prior year reserve development, for which I'll provide more detail shortly, was net favorable $317 million pre-tax in the quarter. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $735 million was 24% higher than in the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio, which improved by 1.8 points from a year ago to 89.5%. The improvement in the underlying combined ratio resulted largely from the continued impacts of earned pricing exceeding loss cost trends in our commercial businesses, and continued favorable loss conditions in personal auto. These improvements were partially offset by the comparison of more typical non-cat weather this year to relatively benign non-cat weather in last year's first quarter. After-tax net investment income increased by 14% from the prior year quarter to $590 million, as higher returns in our non-fixed income portfolio were partially offset by the impact of the expected decline in fixed income yields. Consistent with our comments on the fourth quarter earnings call and in our 10-K, we continue to expect that for the remainder of 2021 fixed income NII, including earnings from short term securities, will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter after-tax. Turning to prior year reserves development, total net favorability of $317 million pre-tax in the quarter included a $72 million benefit from a subrogation settlement with Southern California Edison related to the Woolsey fire of 2018. $62 million of that benefit was recorded in personal insurance, with the remainder recorded in business insurance. Beyond that subrogation benefit, net favorable PYD and personal insurance reflected both auto and property losses coming in better than expected for recent accident years. In Bond and Specialty, net favorable PYD was driven by better than expected results in the surety book. In business insurance net favorable PYD was driven by better than expected loss experience in workers comp, partially offset by some adverse development on losses for environmental exposures in our runoff book. Regarding Reinsurance, as discussed during our fourth quarter results call, we renewed our underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL Treaty for 2021, providing aggregate coverage of $350 million part of $500 million of losses above aggregate retention of $1.9 billion. Through March 31, we have accumulated $915 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention. Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.2 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion. Our net unrealized investment gain decreased from $4.1 billion after-tax at year end to $2.8 billion after-tax at March 31, as interest rates rose during the quarter. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $101.21 at quarter end, up 2% from year end and up 9% from a year ago. We\u2019ve returned $613 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $397 million in dividends of $216 million. Following this quarters share repurchase activity, we have a little more than $800 million remaining under the previously authorized repurchase program. In order to provide appropriate capital management flexibility and reflecting its confidence in our business, the Board authorized an additional $5 billion for share repurchases. And as Alan also mentioned, our Board authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $317 million of segment income for the first quarter, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2020 driven by higher levels of underlying underwriting income, net favorable prior year reserve development in net investment income, which more than offset higher catastrophe losses. We're particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.7%, which improved by 3.6 points, a little less than two points [ph] to that resulted from earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. The improvement also reflects the comparison to the net charge we took in the prior year quarter related to the pandemic. Turning to the top line, net written premiums were down 2% primarily due to lower net written premiums in the workers compensation product line as a result of the impact of the pandemic on payrolls. Net written premium benefited from strong retention, higher renewal rate change in a return to positive exposure growth, reflecting an improving trend in our customer\u2019s outlook for their businesses. Turning to domestic production, renewal rate change remained strong at 8.4%, up 2.5 points from the first quarter of last year, while retention remained high at 83%. Written pricing for some time now has been exceeding loss trend, and is significantly improving the margins of our book. Importantly, we believe we have a high quality book of business in seek to maintain high retention. With that in mind, we continue to execute deliberately and granularly on an account by account and class by class basis, we remain exceptionally pleased with our execution. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal rate change increased to 4.5%, up almost three points from the first quarter of 2020. Retention of 78% reflects deliberate execution as we pursue improve returns in certain segments of this business. As I mentioned above, we're pleased with the segmented execution underneath the aggregate result. New business of $95 million was down $24 million from the prior year quarter, also driven by our focus on improving profitability as we remain disciplined around risk selection, underwriting and pricing. Importantly, we have not slowed down our commitment to invest in product development and ease of doing business, which position us well for the long-term profitable growth in this business. As an example, in previous quarters, we've highlighted our completely redesigned BOP 2.0 small commercial product, which includes industry leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience. During the last three months, we rolled out the new product in an additional seven states, bringing the cumulative total to 30 states, representing approximately 60% of our C&P new business premium. We're encouraged with our agents adoption of the new product as both flow and new business premium are meaningfully improved as compared to the legacy BOP product. In middle market, renewal retains was strong at 9.1% up almost three points from the first quarter of 2020, while retention remained high at 86%. Additionally, we achieved positive rate on more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a 10 point increase from the first quarter of last year. New business was down $12 million, driven by certain business units and geographies where returns are not meeting our thresholds. To sum up, we're pleased with our execution and further improving the underlying margins in the book, we continue to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd.\nTom Kunkel: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted strong returns and solid growth in the quarter, despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $137 million, an increase of 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by an improved underlying underwriting margin and higher business volumes. Elevated cat losses related to the Texas weather event were largely offset by favorable prior year reserved development. The underlying combined ratio of 84.2% improved by a 0.5 due to an improved expense ratio, primarily reflecting higher earned premiums. Earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends was largely offset by the impact of COVID-19 and other loss activity. Turning to the top line, net written premiums grew 9% in the quarter, primarily reflecting strong management liability production. Decreased demand for new construction surety bonds due to the economic impacts of COVID-19 were largely offset by strong commercial surety production. In our management liability business, we are pleased that the renewal premium change remained near historic highs of nearly 11% while retention was a strong 87%. Management liability new business for the quarter decreased $8 million, primarily reflecting our disciplined underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Consistent with recent quarters, submissions were up, while quote activity was down. These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategies to maintain underwriting discipline and pursue rate where needed while maintaining strong retention levels in our high quality portfolio. So, Bond & Specialty results were again strong, despite the challenges in the current environment. And now I'll turn it over to Michael, to discuss Personal Insurance.\nMichael Klein: Thank you, Tom. And good morning, everyone. Personal Insurance began in 2021 with strong profitability and growth. Segment income was $314 million and net written premiums grew 7%. The combined ratio of 90.3% rose about two points from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher levels of catastrophe losses, partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development. On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was a strong 85.4%. Before I turn to product line results, let me remind you that we have updated the presentation of certain financial and statistical data, for our automobile and homeowners and other product lines, to include the results of direct-to-consumer and International. This new presentation provides a more comprehensive view of product line results. Automobile delivered another very strong quarter, with a combined ratio of 81.8% an improvement of more than nine points compared to the first quarter of 2020. The improvement comprises five points of higher net prior year reserved development, and an underlying combined ratio that is four points better than the prior year quarter. These results reflect the ongoing effects of the pandemic, namely lower claim frequency due to fewer miles driven. That said, we have begun to see miles driven moving back toward pre pandemic levels as restrictions have eased and economic activity is picking up. We're actively monitoring current trends and incorporating them into our state specific pricing decisions, as we continue to balance business volumes and profitability. In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 99.4% increased by 15 points relative to the prior year quarter. Driven by catastrophe losses of 22 points up over 11 points, with most coming from the February winter storm and freeze events and an eight point increase in the underlying combined ratio, primarily due to a comparison to unusually mild winter weather in the prior year quarter. Along with about two points of elevated fire losses, many of which relate to extreme winter weather, often resulting from the use of alternative heating sources. The increases were partially offset by five points of higher net favorable prior reserve development, which included the subrogation benefits of the Woolsey wildfire that Dan mentioned. Turning to domestic production, automobile net written premiums grew 3% with 14% growth in new business, while retention remained strong at 84%. Renewal premium change was about flat consistent with our plan to align pricing with our loss experience in auto. We are very pleased with our ongoing balanced execution in this line, which has resulted in 4% year-over-year policies in force growth at attractive returns. Homeowners and other delivered another strong quarter with net written premium growth of 12%. New business was up 21% from the prior year quarter, retention remained strong at 85% and renewal premium change was 7.7%. As Alan mentioned, we have achieved double digit new business growth across auto and home for each of the past nine quarters. Our ongoing new business success is driven by a combination of strategic investments and initiatives, including Quantum Home 2.0, IntelliDrive, and new and expanded partnerships and distribution relationships. In addition to delivering strong results for the quarter, we continue to roll out new and expanded capabilities to deliver value in the eyes of our customers. Recent examples include closing on the acquisition of InsuraMatch, our digital independent agencies that expands our capabilities to serve customers and distribution partners, improving our customer self service capabilities with the rollout of our new MyTravelers mobile application, continuing the rollout of our digital quote proposal to further enhance our agents digital capabilities, further expanding our new version of IntelliDrive into Canada and eight additional states. And adding digital auto discount in nine more states for customers who leverage paperless, telematics and mobile applications. In summary, we're off to a great start to the year and are well positioned to continue to deliver profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael. We're ready to open up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks, and good morning everybody. First question on Business Insurance, I guess as we kind of think about the rest of the year and Alan, your comments on pricing continue to outpace loss trends. I guess want to get your take on, how the renewal price renewal premium change should -- we should expect that to continue to rise, given the impact of maybe better exposure growth for the year and how you think about that, versus maybe a continued deceleration in pricing. So how we can think about maybe the RPC for Business Insurance?\nAlan Schnitzer: Good morning, Michael, thanks for the question. We stopped giving outlook on price change, but I'll make a couple of comments that hopefully are responsive. We are now several years into compounding year-over-year improvement in rate and price. The three sequential quarters prior to this one, I think in Business Insurance anyway, all made record prices. So that's pretty good progress, as consequences are improving. But having said that, the drivers of price change overall are environmental and still relevant. So, we expect that overall pricing and pure rate for that matter, we\u2019ll continue to be at levels that that results in expanding margins for a while. Whether prices in particular lines go up, down or sideways. I don't think we're going to try to predict that, but it's all pretty rational, it's all pretty relative to the rate what we needed. And again, there's always a lot of focus on that headline number because that's what we provide. But we're looking hard at the granular execution underneath that takes into account all the variables of account rate adequacy. So we feel great about this pricing level, we are near all-time highs in pricing, and we expect to continue -- the favorable environment to continue for some time.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thanks, Alan. I guess one more if we could switch over then through the authorization. Anything to read there on that that would signify any interest or lack of interest in any kind of large scale M&A?\nAlan Schnitzer: Dan, you take that.\nDan Frey: Michael, it\u2019s Dan. No signal at all, that\u2019s simply the math I gave you by the time we did the repurchases we did in the first quarter of this year, we were down to $800 million of authorization remaining under the share repurchase. If you look at, our history over the last 10 or 12 years, every time we sort of get down to this level the Board authorizes an additional buyback and this was just the timing to do that.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys.\nDan Frey: Thank you.\nOperator: Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research, your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just following up on that one with rate, just trying to get a feel for, if we look at the eight-four [ph] rate increases, are we seeing more accounts that are closer to rate adequate and that eight-four is a product of some accounts needing a lot and some not needing much at all? If we were to look at across the book of renewals, is it safe to say that you're still getting positive rate on kind of the vast majority of accounts that are renewing?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Good morning, Ryan. This is Greg. Yes, we absolutely are in -- the vast majority of our accounts are getting rate and as Alan said, with nine consecutive quarters with year-over-year rate change, certain pockets, of course, are becoming more rate adequate. And knell up just as a reminders we've shared with you in the past, we really empower our local underwriters to look at every single account based on its own merit, and that we think they've been doing a terrific job of retaining the book and continuing to get some pricing change across the portfolio.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. Again I guess, for Alan, I guess, looking for an update on your current thinking around M&A strategy there, I think in the past, you haven't done any larger deals. I think, maybe simply business might have been the last one I remember, which was, I think, less than a bill. How are you thinking about scale, how are you thinking about M&A appetite?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Ryan, I understand the question and probably the thought process behind it. There's no change in our approach to M&A and that's not to say that that we're not interested. Our shareholders should expect that all the time, we are evaluating transaction opportunities and thinking about them. And we often say some of the best deals we've done and the deals we didn't do. But that's not to say that we're not often looking and thinking strategically about what's out there. And so we have a view on all the things out there and all the markets we're in that might be attracted to us, and under what terms and conditions we'd want to do them. And I would have given you the same answer a year ago, or five years ago, frankly, and as we've said many times that the lens we would use for whether we would do a deal or not are doesn't improve our long-term return profile, does it reduce volatility? And or would it create shareholder value through some other important strategic benefit? So I mean, of course, we do the analysis as granularly and detailed as hopefully you would expect from us. But essentially, that's the lens and that hasn't changed.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you,\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: David Motemaden with Evercore ISI, your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. I guess I had a question for Greg. Was there just in Business Insurance. I'm wondering if there was any sort of COVID benefit that you guys had underneath -- in that underlying loss ratio that we should be thinking about?\nDan Frey: Hey, David, it's Dan Frey, I'll take that. COVID did interest in this quarter in that, we've been living with it for about a year now. Last year as it emerged, it was pretty apparent what we thought the impact was of COVID, because you were looking at an immediately pre COVID environment versus something new, doesn't feel that way anymore. It's sort of woven into the fabric of the economy and overall results. That's one of the reasons that even going back to last year, we chose to leave everything related to COVID in our underlying combined ratio. And when it's really not feasible, to be able to specifically spike out, what do we think the impact of COVID was in the quarter. Having said that, qualitatively, we have we have some idea. You heard Michael talk about the impact of COVID on miles driven in BI didn't get a mention in Business Insurance because we think it was pretty modest. There was, again, some level of direct charges related to COVID specific losses and things like workers comp, but very modest. And we'd say probably largely offset, if not slightly more than offset by related benefits and non-COVID frequency.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it, great. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could just follow-up on that. Obviously great to see the margin expansion little under two points of underlying loss ratio improvement in BI that increased from -- I calculate around 150 basis points in the fourth quarter. It feels to me like that, you'd continue to improve at a better -- at an increasing rate.  But when I look at the amount of renewal rate change that you guys have gotten over the last five to six quarters, I would have thought that there would have been a bit more than two points of improvement this quarter. So maybe you could help me just think about some of the moving pieces here, as we think about margin improvement going forward?\nDan Frey: Sure, David. Its Dan again. I think the numbers that we see coming through business insurance for rate versus trend align with what we've seen from written results over the last several quarters, if you just factor in what's earning its way through. So we did see a steadily increasing level of rate increase over last year, and we are seeing a steadily increasing level of improvement in terms of the earned impact of rate versus trend. It moves slowly, and it moves within sort of tenths of a point, changes at a time. Because the other thing I'd say to keep in mind is, it's not just the simple math of if we got eight points a rate versus five points a trend, that's three points of margin expansion, it's not, its rate versus trend. That's a three percentage point difference. But if you translate it into loss ratio points, when you consider, say, theoretically as 60 is loss ratio that translates into little less than two points of margin expansion. So being close to two points of margin expansion, and expecting that number to increase maybe very slightly from here as the higher rates aren't through is right, where we thought we'd be.\nDavid Motemaden: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Josh Shanker with Bank of America, your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, good morning, everyone. A few out of left field questions that I hope I can get some information on. As you restated the personal line segment and I guess folded the direct to consumer business into homeowners and personal auto segments. What does that say about Travelers interest in the direct to consumer as a channel going forward, should we expect that Travelers will be a player in that market, or it's not really important to your P&L in the long run, and makes more sense just to fold it in?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Josh, it\u2019s Michael. I would say very specifically, the restatement of the financial doesn't say anything about our commitment to direct to consumer, one way or the other, it's still an important capability for us, still a segment of the business we're investing in. Frankly, it got to the point where and you can see it in the restatement that we gave you, it was north of $400 million worth of revenue as of the end of last year. And it was a big enough portion of the business, frankly, that leaving it to the side of the line breakout on the P&L, didn't make sense. Not that it moved the needle on those numbers that much, but it was an important part of the business that we thought it should be fully included in the P&L statistics and then in the domestic production statistics, so that when we do make investments say in for example, marketing and advertising, that drive growth in direct to consumer, we want that to show up in the production results that you see. So I would say it doesn't indicate a change in our emphasis. And if anything, I would, I would say reinforces the importance of that business to us both as a business segment and as an essentially a place to continue to build and test and learn and build capability.\nJosh Shanker: And similarly, how should I think about simply business going forward sort of two parts; one, how big is it, how big does the Travelers think it's going to be over the next few years and two, nothing that we need numbers. But when you are taking a quote in from a direct to consumer manner in business, is the loss ratio materially different then is from your agency directed book?\nDan Frey: You\u2019re talking about simply business, Josh in that [Indiscernible].\nJosh Shanker: Yes, absolutely.\nAlan Schnitzer: Just as a reminder there, we're the intermediary in that business, we're not the market behind it. So we wouldn't comment on the profitability of that. And I would say about simply business, it continues to be a medium term initiative that we feel urgent about, we're not going to break it up more than that. But we are investing in it, it is a very important capability for us. So far, the small commercial market hasn't really adopted a direct approach to buying the product other than at the very micro end. But we're not betting that's going to stay the same. And we're investing in capabilities to make sure that we're prepared to address that market as it matures. Greg, anything?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Just give you a little more color on geographies. But the thrust of a premium is still in the UK, but we've invested in infrastructure in the United States to capture some of that value that that Alan just articulated, but that we believe is going to take some time.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thrust of the revenue, Greg. Not coming through premiums.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Correct.\nJosh Shanker: Well thank you. Thank you for the answers.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo, your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on, going back to the Business Insurance discussion. So it sounds like you guys are kind of looking for a stable rate, I guess across your businesses hoping to kind of confirm, I guess that would be the case kind of stable through the balance of this year, just based off with some commentary? And then would you guys expect workers comp, it sounds like that feels slightly negative. With respect that to inflect this year, or perhaps that's something that we should more we thinking about in 2022?\nAlan Schnitzer: Elyse, on a go forward view of rate, we actually didn't give a view of direction other than to say we expected to continue to be at levels that will continue to contribute to margin expansion. We're just trying to get away from given outlook and prognosticating. We feel great about what we achieved in terms of pricing this quarter and we feel very good about the outlook for pricing. In terms of workers comp. We said in in recent quarters that it feels like we're pretty close to making a bottom and turning around and we continue to feel that way. We saw progress in the quarter both in terms of pure rate, which was slightly negative but a steady improvement over the last several quarters. Premium change, as I said, including exposure was positive for the first time in a few quarters, which we think is really speaks to our customer\u2019s confidence. So that was a really good thing. So that's what we would -- that's what we share about that. I guess the other point, I would say Elyse is, it turns out that the workers comp experience to COVID, at least so far, and we're being cautious about this, but at least so far, what we see in the data is that it's a little bit better than we expected and that could impact pricing going forward. I don't -- I think the likely result of that is maybe instead of hitting the bottom and inflecting positively, it hits the bottom and bounces around there a little bit before making the term positive. But again, not a bad sign, it's reflective of the profitability the line which is been very strong. And we continue to think we're making a bottom and moving towards a turn north.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then my second question, going fast on the M&A discussion. Alan, I think you said, you guys were considered deals with the caveat of not wanting to add to the volatility of the company. As you think about transactions on are there certain business lines that are higher up on the list as you evaluate potential M&A? Can you just help us think through potential transactions from where you might want to add on to business offering?\nAlan Schnitzer: I guess what we said, the comment was, of the three prongs to the lens as we think about reducing volatility is one of the virtues that we might look for. And I guess to your question when we think about our portfolio, we think about our capabilities, we think about the breadth and depth of our business, we feel great. There's nothing missing from our portfolio of businesses, we can we can keep going exactly the way we are and compete very successfully. Having said that, there are various opportunities and some of them could be for scales, some of them could be for products, some of them could be geography, I mean, there's all sorts of things that in one circumstance or another might contribute to an attractive acquisition opportunity for us. So it's hard for me to say, gee, this is what we're looking for. That's what we're looking for. Again, no gaps in capabilities, but potentially some opportunities.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thanks for the color.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Mike Zaremski, with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Craig [Ph], good morning. Maybe sticking with a Business Insurance. You gave us some nuggets about kind of recent loss trend, I think you said, there might have been a slight benefit. Workers comps trending a little better than expected. And I know you guys for longer tail lines, you probably don't want to take a lot of good news in the near term.  But maybe you can kind of give us a sense, other commercial long tail lines are you seeing frequency benefit or severity benefit of kind of has the world in terms of the kind of the courts kind of gotten back to normal or maybe even more than normal in the digital age, zoom age? So kind of curious if you could give us some kind of color on the near term loss trends you've been seeing in commercial long tail lines?\nDan Frey: Sure, Mike its Dan. So I'll take that maybe in a couple of parts. On the quote question in sort of that activity. Let\u2019s say, we see that to continue to be pretty slow. We talked about it last year, in terms of there's definitely a change in the in the data from the fact that quotes were courts for a long time and other settlements on uses have been less active and I think that continues. And I think we'll probably take a while to work through, what could be the backlog there. So what we've done in terms of both our view of current accident year and prior accident, reserve adequacy is to assume that nothing really has changed. So the data might tell you that things look a little bit favorable, we're not really going to react to that. Our assumption is that, once things do get back to normal, ultimately, what we're going to see is social inflation, at the levels and the trends that we've seen it before. Loss cost trend at the elevated rate that we talked about, even in the second quarter of last year, and then ultimately, these things will all settle out in reflection of those levels. So, to the degree that we talked about some favorability last year, and we had some favorability and prior year reserve development this year, a lot of that is frequency driven where the losses themselves and simply not emerged, but from a severity perspective, we're still going to take the view that that we think that's a verity pressure is not really going away. And that's one of the reasons that you see us continuing to pursue rate in Business Insurance, to the degree that we are.\nMike Zaremski: That's very helpful. And my follow-up is probably for Dan, on the investment portfolio. Curious if you can update us on approximate new money yields in the fixed income portfolio versus the expiring portfolio yield. So there's going to a pickup in interest rates. I believe there's still a gap there that you guys are trying to overcome?\nDan Frey: Yes, Mike, there is still a gap. So it's just -- it is a little less than it was. Last quarter, we were talking about that gap being maybe 150 basis points, now, maybe it\u2019s closer to 90 or 100 basis points, but it's still a negative. And a reminder, just the portfolio turns over slowly enough that even when we factored in the current environment, that didn't actually change, because we gave you a $10 million range around our quarterly view of fixed income NII on a go forward basis. So it moved to the needle, but only very, very modestly. Still a gap, new money yield still below what's maturing out of the portfolio.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you,\nOperator: Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thank you. A couple of just quick ones here. First, I'm just curious, could you comment on workers compensation insurance. As we start to see payrolls increasing here, should that have a positive benefit on margins?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey, Brian, good morning. This is Greg. The short answer on that is, yes. And we saw that this quarter, as Alan said, on an RPC basis, workers comp was up. And obviously we don't project where exposure is going to go long-term. But we have shared with you that we are a broad solution of the economy. So as the economy hopefully corrects and improves, we'll see positive and payroll, mostly from new employees in shares. And certainly we'll see some of that on the GL side, with sales receipts increase and also.\nBrian Meredith: Right. Which in favorably impacts margins, not just topline.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, Brian. Margins to the -- you get two pieces of exposure coming through comp, one could be more workers, for which there's not really an expected margin benefit related to that, in and of itself, to the degree that wages go up, and we collect more premium for effectively the same risk, that's when we have historically set a portion of exposure can behave like rate, that's what you see that. So it's a little bit of both to the degree that workers are being added to the payroll that brings with it additional risk, higher wages bring higher exposure, as well.\nDan Frey: And obviously, as volumes go up, regardless of which of those it comes from, you get some expense leverage.\nBrian Meredith: Makes sense. And then can I just focus a little bit on the premium in Business Insurance. Worker's comp, I understand also saw CMP continue to be down. Is that just purely related to what's going on from the economic activity? Or are there other things that are going on right now there where you're calling your portfolio underwriting initiatives to stuff that are potentially pressuring that top line? And perhaps are there any kind of programs in place to kind of recharge that growth at some point?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, Brian, this is Greg. Really its two drivers in that. The first one, I mentioned in my prepared comments. We've really been trying to prove the profitability of that book and you can see that with the RPC increasing five points over the last five quarters. And so that's the primary driver. But we are still feeling the COVID impact, flow overall, and in terms of submissions from the volume from our agents is down also. But I would also say that's a secondary driver.\nBrian Meredith: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Good morning, everybody. My first question is in personal lines. Can you talk about the uptick in the expense ratio, considering that premiums aren't for up quite a bit where if that maybe it would remain a bit flatter? Where are you investing?\nMichael Klein: Sure, this is Michael. Particularly the expense really is volume related costs and commissions think, report ordering. We do continue to make investments in the business and increase our investment level slightly, but really, the driver of the uptick in the expense ratio was just volume related costs in the business. And I wouldn't pay too much attention to a one quarter change, in expenses we still feel good about the expense ratio, the efficiency in the business.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then my second question in Bond & Specialty. I was just curious about the comment that new business declined due to discipline. I'm just trying to read that with effect the management liability rates are near all-time highs. I would have thought that, even with discipline, you'd have more opportunities to write new business. Could you maybe talk about the dynamics there?\nMichael Klein: Sure. The new business flow is actually, when you think of some of the lines that we write, the situation we've been through economically speaking, can create more risks. So think of things like employment practices liability, think about some of the trends that have been in place for public company, D&O. So there are a number of things going on that at this point in time, it makes sense to really be prudent about the risk you're selecting. And we really actually feel quite comfortable with where our new businesses coming in.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Appreciate the responses. Thank you.\nMichael Klein: Thank you.\nOperator: Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on BI rates. Is there seasonality in your first quarter business mix, I realized that workers comp renews on one on one. So I'm just wondering if that might be impacting your wage story for this quarter versus last.\nMichael Klein: There's a little bit more workers comp in this quarter typically, but not a meaningful amount.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. And then we also talk about the child victim more broadly than just the Boy Scout Association that's getting a lot of attention. In our research, we saw that 31 states introducing fact sheet [ph] of limitation reform bill, and you commented in the past on New York, but wondering how you feel about this strength in you reserve light at potentially higher reviver cases, beyond New York.\nDan Frey: Tracy, its Dan. I think we were very early to tackle Child Victims Act stuff. Remember, we took our charge related to New York, in the first quarter of 2019. So I think, pretty far ahead of the market, we've been very cognizant of abuse, molestation and CVA type exposures. We are, as you would imagine, staying very up to speed on developments and potential developments, not only across the state, but with stories like Boy Scouts, where we're very cognizant of our exposures and what the latest news may mean for those exposures. And we continue to be quite comfortable with how those things are reflected in our reserves.\nTracy Benguigui: If I could just sneak in. Would you be willing also to enter into a settlement on the Boy Scouts, similar to one of your competitor?\nDan Frey: I think will comment on any specific matter.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks, Tom, in your comments you mentioned, I guess, other losses of the category within the segment that are at play [Indiscernible].\nTom Kunkel: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the last part of the question.\nMeyer Shields: I am sorry. I hope you could flesh out what you were talking about the underlying loss ratio in Bond & Specialty. You mentioned something about other losses, but I'm not sure what you were referring to?\nTom Kunkel: Yes. So the other losses, we are having some elevated COVID losses versus the first quarter last year. And so that's a significant piece of it. And then you typically have various miscellaneous things, as well as things like mix issues. And so in this particular case, we had some cyber claims this quarter and those actually hit our numbers a little bit, but generally it was COVID and a variety of other things.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that's helpful. And then question for Michael, if I can. I know there's been some news about California's Insurance Commissioner, looking for more data and possibly more rebates. How you think about that for Travelers?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Meyer, good question. And I would say certainly, California is one of a number of states that continue to examine rate levels and premium relief. First and foremost we're working closely with state regulators across the country and continue to remain in contact and respond to requests for information. For the most part, our approach to balancing rate level of woodlots experience has been to manage it through rate and I've mentioned it before, but since the onset of the pandemic, we've actually now filed decreases in about 20 states across the country. California doesn't happen to be one of those. You may recall in later half of 2020, we actually provided an additional premium refund to California policyholders, partly in response to the ongoing dialogue with State of California. But broadly speaking, I would say remaining in contact in conversation with the Department of Insurance, including California and are working to be responsive to, again request for information and or requests for level adjustments, et cetera. So we just continue to monitor and manage the situation.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: This finishes the time allotted for the Q&A session. It is now my pleasure to turn the call back over to Abbe Goldstein for closing comments.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you all for joining us this morning. We really appreciate your time. And as always, if there's any follow-up, reach out to Investor Relations. And have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the Travelers first quarter 2020 results conference call.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded January 24, 2023. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report this morning a solid bottom line for the quarter, exceptional results in our commercial businesses, with higher full year core income and another quarter of attractive margins and strong growth, continued progress addressing the industry-wide loss pressures impacting the Personal Insurance business. Very strong production in all three of our business segments, resulting in consolidated net written premium growth of 10% for the quarter and another quarter of successful execution on the number of important strategic initiatives. Core income for the quarter was $810 million or $3.40 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 12.3%. These results include $362 million of after-tax catastrophe losses. Core income benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.8 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year period. Our solid underlying combined ratio of 91.4% reflects very strong performance in both of our commercial segments. Looking at the two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI/BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 88.3% for the quarter. You will hear from Michael shortly about the progress we are making in Personal Insurance and the roadmap to improve profitability. For the full year, core income of $3 billion or $12.42 per diluted share benefited from higher core income in our commercial segments that was driven by record net earned premiums and strong profitability, including our best ever underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance. Our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to return nearly $3 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including more than $2 billion of share repurchases. At the same time, we grew adjusted book value per share and made important investments in our business. Turning to the top line, thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners. We grew net written premiums by 10% this quarter to $8.8 billion with all three segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 11% to $4.4 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at an historically high 10.1%. In the property line, which has received a lot of attention post-Ian, renewal premium change accelerated month-by-month in the quarter. Even with continued strong pricing across the board, retention in BI reached a record high 88%. As you have heard us say before, strong retention is a sign of a stable and rational pricing environment. New business in the segment of $558 million increased 10% from the prior year period. Given the attractive returns in the segment, we are pleased with the very strong retention of our high-quality book of business and the strong level of new business. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by excellent production in our market leading surety business, where net written premiums were up 18%. Production was also strong in our management liability business, with renewal premium change of 6.3%, retention of 90% and new business, up 23% from a year ago. In Personal Insurance, top line growth was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was meaningfully higher both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to address the industry-wide loss pressure. Renewal premium change alone contributed more than $1 billion of written premium to our portfolio over the past year. With another quarter of impressive production in each of our segments, we feel very well positioned for the new year. You will hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Our 2022 results cap off a decade of strong and consistent performance. We posted a double-digit return on equity in every year over the last decade with the exception of 2017, a difficult CAT year for the industry in which we posted a 9% ROE. In every one of those years, we comfortably covered our cost of equity. And over the last six years, we have significantly increased our rate of top line growth. We have accomplished all of this with industry low volatility. Successfully investing in differentiating capabilities has been a significant focus for us and an important contributor to our success. As you can see on Slide 24, over the past five years, we have meaningfully increased our overall technology spend. At the same time, through our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency, we have significantly reduced our expense ratio. In addition, we have improved the mix of our technology spend, increasing our spending on strategic initiatives by nearly 70%, while holding routine, but necessary expenditures about flat. The consistency of our results also benefits from the diversification of our business across our three segments. If we look back at the combined ratio over the last 10 years, in five of those years, Personal Insurance outperformed business insurance. In the other five years, Business Insurance outperformed Personal Insurance. And our Bond & Specialty business delivered spectacular results in every one of those years. The depth and breadth of our diversified businesses is a key advantage and would be very difficult to replicate. Speaking of our business profile, given the economic instability and geopolitical risk around the world, we feel very good about our concentration in North America, the largest, most advanced and most stable economy in the world, where we have the pole position and plenty of room to grow. With uncertain economic conditions ahead, I will also note we have a strong track record of performance through a variety of challenging environments over many years. We have got the experience, the know-how and the capabilities along with an efficient operating model and a rock solid balance sheet to manage through whatever comes our way. To sum things up, I am grateful to my more than 30,000 colleagues for all they have accomplished this year and over time. Given our strong foundation, our track record of successful innovation and our ambitious roadmap, we are very confident in the outlook for Travelers. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $810 million, a very strong result considering the significant impact of CAT 73, the winter storm that occurred in late December. Core income for the full year was $3 billion. For the quarter, core return on equity was 12.3%, including the 5.9 percentage point adverse impact of CAT 73. For the full year, core ROE was 11.3%. As you heard from Alan, our consistently strong performance has delivered double-digit core ROE in nine of the past 10 years, averaging 12.6% over that timeframe and our adjusted book value per share has nearly doubled over the past decade. For the quarter, underlying underwriting income of $723 million pre-tax reflected higher levels of earned premium in all three segments and a consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. Terrific underlying combined ratios in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by results in Personal Insurance. Results in all three segments reflected the benefit of earned price that exceeded loss trend. One additional comment on underlying underwriting income. Prior to 2020, the highest level of full year underlying underwriting income we had ever reported was $1.5 billion after-tax. Despite the significant adverse impact of elevated inflation on profitability in Personal Insurance, 2022 marks the third consecutive year with underlying underwriting income above $2 billion after tax. Simply put, our increased premium volumes and diversified portfolio of businesses are generating underwriting profit dollars at a completely different level than where we were just a few years ago. The fourth quarter expense ratio of 27.9% brings the full year expense ratio of 28.5%, our lowest full year expense ratio ever. As we have discussed previously, the improvement in the expense ratio has not been achieved through cutting corners or artificially managing expenses for the short-term. Rather, we have made and continue to make significant investments in technology and other strategic initiatives that we believe will drive our continued success. Our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency has improved our operating leverage. Looking ahead to 2023, we are very comfortable with an expected full year expense ratio in the range of 28.5% to 29%. Our fourth quarter CAT losses were $459 million pre-tax. Activity in the quarter was driven by $512 million from the large winter storm in late December, which impacted most of the U.S. as well as Canada while our losses from this event were significant, but were not outsized relative to our modeled estimates for a storm of this size and intensity. Turning to prior year reserve development, we had net favorable development of $185 million pre-tax on a consolidated basis. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $127 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers\u2019 comp across multiple accident years, partially offset by increased loss estimates for general liability coverages, primarily umbrella, where year-over-year inflation has resulted in more losses reaching excess layers of coverage. The Bond & Specialty segment saw a net favorable development of $51 million, while in Personal Insurance we recorded net favorable PYD of $7 million. After-tax net investment income of $531 million reflected another quarter of improving returns and higher invested assets in the fixed income portfolio and modest returns in the alternative portfolio, which we expected given the downturn in the broader equity markets that occurred during the third quarter. Looking forward to 2023, we expect after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities to average about $535 million per quarter with an estimated $515 million in Q1, growing to an estimated $560 million in Q4. Page 21 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 CAT Treaty renewals. Our longstanding corporate CAT XOL Treaty continues to provide coverage for both single CAT events and the aggregation of losses from multiple CAT events. Consistent with the increase in our annual net written premium volume for property, we increased our retention level to $3.5 billion from the prior $3 billion level. The Treaty provides 100% coverage for the $2 billion layer above the $3.5 billion retention. The per occurrence loss deductible remains unchanged at $100 million. We did not renew the underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL Treaty, which was only 45% placed in 2022. As we have said previously, we believe that hardening a reinsurance market provides a relative advantage for Travelers. Our consistently strong underwriting results give us an advantage in terms of reinsurance pricing and capacity. That, combined with the fact that we buy less reinsurance than most of our peers, gives us a cost of good sold advantage. We can let that fall to the bottom line or reflected in pricing without compromising our return objectives, making us more competitive for attractive new business opportunities. Overall, while property reinsurance pricing was higher when we consider the level of price increase as well as changes in terms and conditions we are obtaining on our direct written business, we do not expect a noticeable impact on our net underlying loss ratio for property. Also related to the overall reinsurance market as well as the E&S market, you will recall that in 2021 we took a minority ownership stake in Fidelis. Effective January 1, 2023, we have separately entered into an agreement with Fidelis, whereby Travelers will take a 20% quota share on policies issued by Fidelis with effective dates in 2023. The market for Fidelis products is probably as favorable as it has been in 20 years or so and the market was impacted by 9/11, dot-com collapse and Hurricane Katrina. This quota share arrangement allows us to participate in the hard market, while also accelerating our understanding of this marketplace. While strategically valuable and expected to be accretive to earnings, the quota share deal is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results. Our portion of net written premiums from Fidelis is expected to be around $550 million to $600 million for the full year and those premiums will be reflected within the international results of Business Insurance. Detailed terms of the quota share have not been disclosed, but we can share that there is a loss ratio cap to ensure that even a worst case underwriting scenario is boxed to a very manageable impact on Travelers. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flow for the quarter of $1.3 billion was again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. For the full year, operating cash flow was once again very strong at $6.5 billion, reflecting the benefit of continued increases in premium volume, strong profitability and paid losses that for the full year were once again less than 90% of incurred losses. As we have said previously, we are assuming that this lower level of payment activity is ultimately a timing issue. In establishing our reserves and pricing our products, we assume that elevated severity related to social inflation has not abated at all. Our substantial cash flows give us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio, which increased to $86.7 billion, excluding net unrealized losses at year end. Interest rates increased slightly during the fourth quarter, but spreads narrowed. And accordingly, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $6.3 billion after tax as of September 30 to $4.9 billion after tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $114 at year-end, up 4% from a year ago. We returned $721 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $220 million and share repurchases of $501 million. For the year, we returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of share repurchases. Overall, we had another very good year with strong top line growth in all three business segments, excellent and improved margins in our commercial businesses, our best ever expense ratio and a very strong balance sheet that has us well positioned for whatever economic conditions the future may bring. And now, I will turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter rounding on a terrific year in terms of financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. We are firing on all cylinders. Segment income for the quarter was $725 million with an all-in combined ratio of 89.5%, both great results. We are once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio, which was also 89.5%, an all-time best fourth quarter result. The underlying loss ratio increased by a little more than 0.5 point as the benefit of earned pricing was more than offset by the comparison to the prior year quarter, which benefited from both a particularly low level of property losses and the favorable impact associated with the pandemic. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was more than offset by a lower expense ratio that benefited from our ongoing strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 11% from the prior year quarter to a fourth quarter record of $4.4 billion, benefiting from strong renewal premium change, high retention and an increase in new business levels. Turning to domestic production for the quarter, renewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.1%, with renewal rate change of 4.5% and record growth in exposure. Retention reached an all-time high at 88%. New business of $558 million was the strongest fourth quarter we have ever produced. At the product level, in addition to what you heard from Alan about pricing in the property line, terms and conditions and the line tightened over the course of the quarter, further improving the price per unit of risk. While not reflected in our production metrics, this improvement in the price per unit of risk will contribute to our profitability over time. In workers\u2019 comp, renewal rate change was a little more negative than we have seen in recent quarters, which is a reflection of the strong profitability in the line and the benefit of continued strong exposure growth. Overall, workers\u2019 comp renewal premium change was positive in the mid single-digit range and actually a little higher year-over-year. We are pleased with these strong production results and the excellent execution by our colleagues in the field. Given our high-quality book as well as several years of segmented rate increases, together with improvements in terms and conditions, we\u2019re thrilled to continue to achieve this historically strong retention levels. The pricing gains we achieved in the quarter reflect our deliberate execution, which balanced the persistent headwinds and uncertainty in the current environment with the improvement in profitability across our portfolio after several years of strong pricing. As always, we will continue to execute our granular pricing, careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sublimits and exclusions to maintain profitable growth. As for the individual businesses, in select, both renewal premium change of 10.8% and retention of 83% were strong. New business was up 6% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product as well as growth in other lines. We\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in improving the profitability of this business over the last couple of years, while continuing to invest for future growth. In middle market, renewal premium change remained historically strong at 8.8%, while retention of 91% reached an all-time best. New business was up 13% from the prior year quarter. As for full year results, segment income of more than $2.5 billion was exceptional, benefiting from record earned premium in our best-ever underlying combined ratio. In addition, the top line of $17.6 billion and full year retention were both record highs, while new business premiums were near in all-time high. These results were driven by the successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies. And while delivering these financial and production results, we\u2019ve also continued to invest in strategic capabilities that will enhance our many competitive advantages, designed to enable us to continue delivering profitable growth over time. For example, during the year, we advanced our already state-of-the-art product and service capabilities by continuing to roll out our BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 46 states as well as launching our new commercial auto product in a handful of states. Both products contain industry-leading segmentation. In addition, we continue to make progress on developing industry-leading user experience capabilities to make it easier and more efficient for our distribution partners and customers to do business with us. In particular, in our middle market business, we advanced our capabilities around digitizing the underwriting transaction for our agents and brokers. And in our Small Commercial segment, we launched our new front-end rate quote and issue interface platform to make it faster and easier for our agents to write business with us, all while maintaining the underwriting discipline and specialization behind the scenes. And finally, we continued to improve our operating leverage through our relentless focus on productivity and efficiency, as I referenced earlier. I\u2019ll note that our full year expense ratio of 29.7% is down more than 2.5 points from the 2016 level. We\u2019re proud of these results and the team that produce them. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty ended a terrific 2022 with another great quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $221 million, up 30% from the prior year quarter, driven by strong and higher earned premium and an exceptionally strong combined ratio, which benefited from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio was also strong and improved about 1.5 points from the prior year quarter to a terrific 81.7%, driven by the benefit of earned pricing. Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 5%, excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Domestic Surety grew an outstanding 18% in the quarter, driven by an increase in the number of bonds issued and higher average bond premiums. In domestic management liability. Given the strong returns, we\u2019re very pleased that we increased retention of point from last quarter to a near record 90%. That\u2019s a 4-point improvement from the prior year quarter. Renewal premium change was solid at 6.3%, and we\u2019re also pleased that we increased new business 23% from the prior year quarter. Excluding FX, net written premium in our international business contracted modestly from the exceptionally strong fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to the impact of the significant decline in merger and acquisition activity on our transactional liability book of business. For the full year, Bond & Specialty produced record earned premiums and an outstanding combined ratio of 75.3%, driving segment income above $900 million for the first time ever. So for both the quarter and year, our results were terrific, driven by excellent execution, returns from our ongoing strategic investments in our competitive advantages and the market-leading value proposition that we offer our customers and distribution partners. And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, the fourth quarter loss of $61 million and a combined ratio of 105.3% were negatively impacted by the weather event in late December as well as elevated underlying loss activity in both automobile and homeowners and other. While our results aren\u2019t meeting our target returns, we are encouraged by our strong marketplace execution as we continue to respond to the loss environment with both increased pricing and non-rate actions. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 13%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both domestic automobile and homeowners, reflecting our focus on improving profitability. In automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 111.4%. As a reminder, while there is some seasonality in auto every quarter, the fourth quarter typically has an elevated loss ratio driven by things like holiday driving in Northeast winter weather. Over the last 10 years, the fourth quarter underlying loss ratio has been approximately six to 7 points above the average for the first three quarters. Seasonality aside, the underlying combined ratio of 110.5% increased 6.7 points from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily related to the continued inflationary impact on vehicle replacement and repair costs, as well as increased claim frequency, which returns to pre-pandemic levels in the quarter and higher bodily injury severity. These loss impacts were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing and a 1-point reduction in the expense ratio. Separately, the current quarter results included a modest impact for the reestimation of prior quarters. We continue to factor our latest view of loss experience into our pricing actions going forward. In Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 99.4%. This was 21.6 points higher relative to the prior year quarter, driven by catastrophe losses that were 13 points, 2 points higher than the prior year period and a higher underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 82.2% increased 8.8 points. This increase was primarily driven by higher loss severity related to continued labor and material price increases as well as higher non-catastrophe weather losses. This loss pressure was partially offset by the current quarter benefit of earned pricing. Turning to production. Quarterly results reflect our rate and non-rate actions as we seek to manage growth and improve profitability. In domestic automobile, retention moderated this quarter as renewal premium change increased 3 points from the third quarter to 11.4%. New business written premiums declined 3% prior to the prior year compared to the prior year, and policies in force were essentially flat with last quarter as our additional rate and non-rate actions are taking effect. In domestic Homeowners and Other, we achieved renewal premium change of 14.5% in the fourth quarter. The retention remained strong at 84%. Slide 17 provides a graphical representation of renewal premium change in domestic automobile and homeowners and other. We added this view to highlight our progress with respect to renewal premium change over the last several quarters. The magnitude and speed of our pricing actions simultaneously across both lines of business is significant. As Alan mentioned, we have added over $1 billion of written premium to our portfolio in 2022 as a result of the high levels of renewal premium change. The benefits of this increased pricing will continue to earn into our results over time. Looking ahead to 2023, renewal premium change in both lines of business will increase above these already very strong levels as we continue to take action to improve profitability. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we expect written pricing in auto to be adequate in states representing the majority of our business by midyear 2023. In 2022, our team met a challenging environment head-on and took action to address rising costs. We are confident that the actions we have taken and will continue to take will drive improved profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks very much, and we\u2019re happy to open up for your questions now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s Greg Peters. I guess I\u2019ll start with the first question on Business Insurance and the growth. You produced some outstanding results in all of your segments and for \u201822. And there is a bunch of factors that we\u2019re considering as we think about the outlook for \u201823 and \u201824. We\u2019re watching, obviously, as you are the renewal premium change. We\u2019re also watching the rate change on renewals. And I\u2019m curious, when you look about \u2013 when you think about \u201823, what are some of the factors that you think might influence your top line results in Business Insurance?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Greg, good morning. And thank you for the question. Let me just go back to basics and just talk about how we approach this business because we don\u2019t approach it with a grower shrink mentality, we approach it with an overall approach to the marketplace. So we look at our business and we want to keep our best business, and you can see our retention this quarter was off the charts, which is a reflection of how we feel about that book of business. We want to improve the returns on the business that need it, and so we want to execute at a very granular, very thoughtful, very strategic level in terms of price and rate in RPC and then by investing in franchise value and through a lot of hustle in the marketplace. We want to make sure that we\u2019re generating attractive new business opportunities. And we\u2019re going to \u2013 we did that in \u201822 and the results have been fantastic. We\u2019re going to do it again in \u201823, and we\u2019re very confident about that. And let me spend just a second on the pricing environment because that seemed like it was part of your question, and I\u2019ve seen a number of you write about it this morning. So I think it\u2019s hard to characterize this pricing environment as anything other than very strong. At 10.1% that RPC is spot on an eight-quarter average. So incredibly stable and near record levels. Small movements between pure rate and exposure, but I would emphasize small movements between rate and exposure. The breadth of the pricing gains across our book is very strong and very consistent. I don\u2019t think you can assess the pricing environment without looking at retention and given where that is literally record levels and given the profitability very strong. The pricing gains that we achieved were broad-based, led by property, auto, umbrella and CMP. And then you take all that against the margins that we printed and we just \u2013 we feel fantastic about the pricing and the overall execution this year. And again, we\u2019re going to go out and do it again in \u201823.\nGreg Peters: Just a point in your answer, you mentioned the renewal premium change. Can you talk about your perspective on what\u2019s going on with the renewal rate change, which seems to be trending down?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Again, we\u2019re executing at a very granular level, looking at what it is we need to do by account. And you look at that 10.1% overall renewal premium change, very strong near-record levels. And the fact that there is a little bit of movement back and forth between rate and exposure to us almost inconsequential. So you can look at that 0.5 point of change in isolation and try to make something out of it. We look at the overall production picture, and it just looks fantastic. So \u2013 and again, Greg made a really important comment in his remarks, which is we\u2019re \u2013 the execution you see is balancing a bunch of things going on. On the one hand, there is headwinds and some uncertainty. We\u2019ve got inflation in the marketplace, supply chain is \u2013 hasn\u2019t returned to pre-pandemic levels. We\u2019ve got weather volatility. We\u2019ve got reinsurance. We\u2019ve got social inflation we\u2019ve talked about over the years. So on the one hand, that continues to be a headwind for us, and we take that into account. But on the other hand, we\u2019ve got a bunch of years of very strong pricing and look at where the margins are today. So the rate change of 4.5% and the overall RPC doesn\u2019t happen to us. That\u2019s a very deliberate execution on our part, taking into account everything that we see in front of us.\nGreg Peters: Great. And just the last clarification point, you talked about the inflation factors. And I think in the comments, you mentioned there are some issues in umbrella, minor issues. What\u2019s your view on inflation trends as it might affect the reserve levels for \u201823 relative to what your assumptions may have been last year? That\u2019s it.\nDan Frey: Hey, Greg, it\u2019s Dan. So I don\u2019t think anything terribly surprising. And I guess I\u2019d step back and look at reserve development over the course of 2022 and say, full year number, $650 million of favorable reserve development. Of course, there are some lines that are going to develop a little better and some that are going to develop a little worse, but $650 million over the course of the year, favorable development in all three segments of the business. Umbrella, not really different than our overall thesis, but sort of the degree to which severity moved was a little more than we expected. So as we usually do, we\u2019re trying to look at the data as quickly as possible and react as quickly as possible and all of that inside of a net favorable PYD. So we\u2019re feeling very good about where the balance sheet is.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. First question, just around the excess capital position. Historically, the company has been able to easily return operating earnings and in some years, even more than debt of shareholders. We\u2019ve never seen this level of first of all, exposure growth and also just seeing the retention go up on the property CAT Treaty, are we at a point yet where I guess the growth and the risk of the business could start to impact capital return decisions?\nDan Frey: Hey, Ryan. Good morning. It\u2019s Dan. Yes, look, I think we\u2019ve talked even a couple of years ago about the fact that we were seeing an increase in the level of top line growth. We knew we were going to need to hold more capital to reflect both a bigger top line book of business, which brings with it a higher level of reserves on the balance sheet. And so we said at that time, look, don\u2019t expect us to continue to be able to return nearly 100% in terms of operating earnings between buybacks and dividends. I think what you see in 2022, in particular, is the fact that we had a good strong capital position coming out of 2021. Remember, earnings in the fourth quarter of last year were tremendously strong. So we probably exited last year with a little more capital than we might have forecasted we were going to end the year. So what we\u2019re doing in 2022 with capital management and as we go into \u201823 is considering all the things that you just said, that continued outlook for top line growth, where the balance sheet is from a reserve perspective, what our reinsurance programs are and what our property exposures look like. And we were very comfortable returning what we just did in the fourth quarter.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then a follow-up for Michael, just thinking about the rate you are taking on the homes side, is there a way to kind of compartmentalize that in terms of how much of the rate is toward attritional type losses versus how much is budgeting for higher caps? I am not sure if there is, but I would be curious if you had any perspective on that?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Ryan. Thanks for the question. I would say, broadly speaking, it\u2019s sort of hard to compartmentalize because the majority of the rate we are taking is base rate. Now again, the numbers that we give you are renewal premium change. So, just to clarify, right, renewal premium change is rate and values, and we have talked about the fact that the RPC numbers that you see certainly include both. And our outlook for 2023, where we indicate that renewal premium change is going to go north from here, is driven by further increases in both rate and values. But in terms of attritional loss versus CAT loss, again, it\u2019s fairly broad-based rate across the book. So, there is not really a significant differentiation there.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Thanks. Good morning. Michael or actually, Dan, sorry about that. Dan, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the financial impacts of non-renewing the aggregate reinsurance outside of a higher potential catastrophe load? I think when you put it on, there was a 50 basis point headwind to the underlying combined ratio, which obviously was offset by lower CAT load, but that was back in 2019, so I am sure it\u2019s changed. It doesn\u2019t sound like you expect a noticeable impact on the property loss ratio or the total company expense ratio. So, just wondering if you could just sort of talk through the puts and takes of non-renewing that aggregate?\nDan Frey: Sure, David. So, a couple of things, in 2022, we did not attach the treaty, right. So, we didn\u2019t hit the underlying, so it didn\u2019t have any beneficial impact in 2022\u2019s results. You are right that when we first entered into the treaty, which was at the beginning of 2019, we said at the time that the impact of the incremental ceded premium from that treaty was going to have about 0.5 point adverse impact on underlying results because of the impact on the denominator. In 2019, we told you that we placed \u2013 it\u2019s the same $500 million layer in all four years. In 2019, we have told you that we placed 85% of the layer. In 2022, we only placed 45% of the layer. So, in sort of broad sweeping terms, you could expect that the absence \u2013 the impact in 2022 on the underlying would have been about half as much as it was in 2019. And so that\u2019s what the year-over-year comparison will look like in 2023. So, maybe somewhere around 0.25 (ph) of a point.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And then just following up on that, is that something and you also mentioned just the relative cost of goods sold advantage from buying less reinsurance. Does that benefit something you are looking to price or just allow to flow through in pricing as opposed to falling to the bottom line just based on your commentary, it sounds like that might be the case, but maybe elaborate on that as well.\nDan Frey: Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really big enough to impact the way we think about the pricing on the property book overall. I mean \u2013 so again, we placed 45% of the $500 million layer. We didn\u2019t attach it. If you look across the business, we have got $8 billion or $9 billion worth of property premium. It goes into our consideration of how do we think about pricing in our underwriting appetite. But we said sort of from the first day we bought that treaty and we sort of would have been happy if we bought it or almost as happy if we didn\u2019t buy it, it was sort of on the margin. So, the absence of it is not really going to have any impact on the way we view pricing adequacy and property.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thank you. And then coming back to Michael, just wondering, I think in the past, I have heard you guys talk about mid-90s combined ratio in auto. And you said you thought you could get to written rate adequacy still by \u201823. Maybe just one, is that still the right combined ratio to think about you guys are targeting? And then any sort of view on timing of when you think you can get there?\nMichael Klein: Sure, David. I think in terms of the target, obviously, it\u2019s impacted by a lot of things. I think we have said mid-90s or even a range on the upper end of the mid-90s is actually, I think what we have talked about historically. Certainly, investment yields are better than they were when we talked about that. But I think broadly speaking, you can think of that range as where we are trying to get to. And again, as I have described last quarter and reiterated this quarter, we think that written pricing will get to adequacy on the majority of the business by midyear. So, again, that\u2019s a leading indicator of what you are going to see in GAAP results, right. So, I have also talked about the price we are taking will earn its way into our results over time. This morning, I have said you will see the benefit sort of throughout \u201823 and beyond. I think what\u2019s important to note is the comment we made this morning about the growing impact of earned rate on the auto results this quarter, that impact will grow through 2023 as we have taken \u2013 you see more and more written RPC in the book of business as the year goes forward this year. We have talked about higher levels of written RPC in 2023 that paves the way for increased earned rate impacting the book of business quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter as you go into 2023. So, I think those are the breadcrumbs we are trying to give you in terms of how to lay out your expectations for next year. Obviously, the million-dollar question for everybody in \u201823 is what happens to loss experience and where the loss trends go from here. And that\u2019s the \u2013 if you sort of lay out your own view of earned rate versus what\u2019s going to happen to loss trend that will sort of help you figure where you think the lines are going to cross.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Michael, maybe picking up on your last comment, I mean you say that you guys are going to reach within rate adequacy in personal auto. So, what are you guys assuming for frequency and severity from here when you make that comment?\nMichael Klein: Yes. Elyse, I think we are not going to get into specifics on frequency and severity assumptions for next year. I think what we have talked about pretty consistently is we have been booking to the loss experience that we have seen, those booked trends remain double digit as we talk \u2013 as we sit here today, talking about the fourth quarter. And again, we have pretty consistently talked about observing double-digit severity trends in the book. Frankly, that\u2019s a property comment and an auto comment. And is the severity and loss pressure that we are contending with. And we have also said that we have been factoring those increased costs into our expectations, both in terms of the actual experience and our outlook. But I don\u2019t think we are going to put a number on the forecast severity and frequency trends beyond that.\nElyse Greenspan: Then on the reinsurance program, can you give us a sense of \u2013 an absolute sense of how much your reinsurance costs went up? And then on the capital side, as you guys have added more volatility right by retaining additional CAT losses in \u201823, how could that affect your capital allocation? Should we expect lower buyback in the second quarter and third quarter? And could this even impact the excess capital that you would have for new business growth?\nDan Frey: So, a couple of things, Elyse, it\u2019s Dan. We are not going to go into the details of reinsurance pricing. What I was trying to communicate in my comments was when we consider the pricing that we are getting on the direct business that we are writing in our management and terms and conditions. We don\u2019t expect the higher pricing for reinsurance to have much of an impact on our margins. And again, the change in the overall treaty, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a significant impact on our capital position, I really think of it as sort of business as usual. We made the comment that the attachment employee increase is sort of in line with our increase in property premiums. So, the attachment point went up 16% or 17%. Our premium volume in 2022 compared to 2021 was up 15% or 16% or 17% in both business insurance and personal insurance I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a dramatic impact on \u2013 it does not have a significant impact on our view of capital adequacy now. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a significant impact on the way you see us behave from a capital perspective in 2023.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Meyer Shields from ABW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning all. A quick question on, I guess the quota share arrangement. Can you talk about \u2013 and I am putting this as binary, and it\u2019s probably not. But can you talk about why Travelers is going through sort of quota share arrangements to capitalize on the hard property market as opposed to your own excess and surplus science paper?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Meyer, it\u2019s we have got all the flexibility in our property business and in our other businesses with E&S paper and otherwise to do whatever it is we want to do. This was an opportunity for us to work a little bit more closely with Fidelis. We think they are interesting in what they do and wanted to understand it a little bit better. And they are in some businesses that we just haven\u2019t historically been in. And so in cases like that, it\u2019s not the only place we have done it. But in cases like that, we look to leverage the capabilities of other talented underwriters and this is just one of those opportunities.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. No, that makes sense. And then a quick question for Michael. You talked a little bit about, I think un-quantified the impact of accident year \u201822 loss take increases in the fourth quarter, did that change have a meaningful impact on the indicated rate need?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Meyer. Again, I would say every quarters of additional experience where we see double-digit loss increased experience impacts our rate need, it impacts our loss experience. The good news is it factors into the evidence we have to go to regulators to ask for rate increases. So, it certainly, the additional quarter of sort of double-digit severity did put additional upward pressure on our rate indications and that\u2019s what we are factoring into the indications were taken to the department in early 2023.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Prefect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Scott: Hi. Good morning. I had one follow-up on the personal auto. We saw a peer of yours that\u2019s had severity sort of picking up maybe faster than they even were expecting earlier in the year and as well as bodily injury that\u2019s sort of being settled at this point. Just wanted to see, is that something you have looked at harder in your book, how confident are you that you are fully capturing the severity in the way you are reserving on the auto? Do you feel comfortable with where that is headed into 2023 and the starting point here?\nMichael Klein: Sure. This is Michael. Maybe I will start and Dan can speak to the reserving element of it. Certainly, as I talked about the prior period comparison in auto, we are seeing severity across auto physical damage coverages and bodily injury coverages. We have talked about both auto physical damage and bodily injury and either prepared remarks or Q&A sort of throughout the year. We have certainly spent more time talking about auto physical damage, but bodily injury severity trends have been elevated throughout the year. I think we have talked about them being elevated, but consistent with our expectations. They were a little worse in Q4, which is why we call them out. But we have booked to that in our Q4 results. They were also an element of the prior period \u2013 current year prior quarter development that I called out in the prepared remarks as well. So, they are in the loss estimates that we booked for the quarter and the full year.\nDan Frey: Alex, it\u2019s Dan. Just in terms of the balance sheet, I think we made this comment last quarter as well. We were pretty consistent in 2020 and 2021 in saying that we felt we were being appropriately cautious in allowing for the elevated level of uncertainty in the environment at that time when we were making our loss picks, including in personal insurance. And I think that\u2019s continued to proven to hold up. As Michael said, our expectation was always that bodily injury severity, not only was elevated, but the trend slope was upward moving on that. And so I think when you take into consideration the fact that we were sort of intentionally reflecting an elevated level of uncertainty in \u201820 and \u201821 and trying to continuously react to the most recent data as it comes in to this point all the way through the end of 2022, our reserves for prior years have held up just fine.\nAlex Scott: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then my follow-up is on workers\u2019 comp actually. We were just looking at some of the NCCI stuff out there. I mean it looks like in \u201823, maybe there is a bit more pressure on workers\u2019 comp pricing than even in the recent years. I appreciate though that there is also an improving starting point for ultimate loss ratios just based on the way that the development has been trending. So, when I think about all those things, I mean can you help me think through what that means for accident year loss ratios in \u201823, just at a high level and whether we should be thinking about that as a pressure point?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Alex, let me start, and I will look at Greg, if I missed something here. So, renewal price change was mid-single digits positive, as you heard from Greg. Given the durations of the liability, we take a pretty cautious view on how we think about loss trend and the outlook for that. And so you would say pricing is a little bit positive, you would say loss trends negative. And the net of those two things would probably be a little bit negative as we think about next year. I think the question is going to be what\u2019s loss trend going to do because it has \u2013 over the last few years or more than that surprised us to the benign side. And so we will just have to see where the losses come in and then take a look at the calendar year results. But again, I would just say workers\u2019 comp has been a fantastic line for us. And we think the outlook for it is positive as well.\nAlex Scott: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: Good morning everybody. First question, just going back to the CAT load. So, I think we are seeing a non-renewal of the property ad cover, a shift up in XOL retention, maybe some additional CAT coming in from Fidelis the quota share as well. How should we think about that kind of in aggregate as we think about 2023, does that essentially mean that we should think about maybe a lower aggregate loss ratio, but maybe some additional volatility?\nAlan Schnitzer: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where I would go Yaron on that. Tell me what you would look at that would lead you to look for a lower aggregate loss ratio?\nYaron Kinar: Well, I would think that more cat-exposed business would have a lower attritional loss ratio coming with it, provide retention rates, we have a lower return on additional loss year as well.\nDan Frey: Yes. I think you are really talking on the margins. I don\u2019t think we are very \u2013 we are significantly changing the mix of the property book we write in terms of what its cat-exposed profile is. Fidelis, again, at those levels and a portion of what they write is going to be cat-exposed. But at that level, that\u2019s going to have a very small impact on our overall base of premiums. We look at the CAT results over the last few years. And I think like everyone sort of continually update our view of \u2013 and for us, it\u2019s importantly \u2013 it\u2019s weather losses, not just what falls into the catastrophe bucket, right, because we have got sort of a more restrictive definition of what CAT is than most other folks. But it\u2019s really not a significant change. So, we don\u2019t see a significant change in the relative percentage of the book that\u2019s CAT exposed. We don\u2019t see a significant change despite some changes in reinsurance, I would describe those changes in reinsurance relative to the property book as a whole as pretty modest. So, I don\u2019t think it dramatically changes our CAT profile. So, I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s going to have a significant impact on the way we think about the property book going forward.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe shifting to Michael\u2019s world, were there any entry year catch-ups in personal auto this quarter?\nMichael Klein: Yes, Yaron, it\u2019s Michael. I think to your question, we did have a modest impact from re-estimation of prior quarters. And I talked about the auto physical damage, the frequency and the bodily injury as the drivers of the period-to-period change. There was really some prior year re-estimation sort of across a number of factors in the book, but again, it was modest.\nYaron Kinar: And is it something you can quantify or not at this time?\nMichael Klein: Yes. I mean it was, I would say, about a point, a point or two points kind of \u2013 and again, it varied a little bit by coverage, but call it around one point or so.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you very much.\nOperator: That concludes the Q&A session. I now turn the call over to Ms. Goldstein.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much. I appreciate your time this morning. I know there were several people left in queue. So, as usual, please feel free to follow-up after. Thanks so much. Have a good day."}, {"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 3, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-10-19 13:41:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 19, 2022. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2022 results. We released our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by acknowledging the devastation and loss of life caused by hurricanes Ian and Fiona. We're thinking of all those who have been impacted and are supporting the Red Cross's disaster relief efforts. In addition, as always after events like these we're focused on taking care of our customers. We're on track to meet our objective of resolving 90% of our property claims arising out of the storms within 30 days. My thanks to all our claim colleagues who are working hard to make that happen. Moving to our results, we're pleased to report this morning a solid bottom line for the quarter particularly in light of the significant industry wide catastrophe losses. Strong and improved underwriting profitability in our commercial business segments. Progress addressing the environmental headwinds facing the personal insurance industry. A meaningful contribution from net investment income, including positive returns from our alternative investment portfolio, notwithstanding the challenging equity market. Very strong production in all three of our business segments, resulting in strong growth in net written premiums, and another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. Core income for the quarter was $526 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 7.9%. These results benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.6 billion up 10% over the prior year quarter, and a solid underlying combined ratio of 92.5%. The nine months core to non-equity was 10.9%. Given the challenging environmental issues impacting the personal insurance industry, these consolidated results once again demonstrate the benefit of our diversified portfolio of businesses. We're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying results in our commercial businesses. Looking at the two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI-BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 88% for the quarter. As expected results in personal insurance were impacted by elevated severity in both auto and home. As you'll hear from Michael, we're continuing to make progress addressing the environmental loss cost issues. In terms of catastrophe losses, as I've described before, strategic efforts we have undertaken in recent years have enabled us to more effectively manage our exposure to catastrophes and more efficiently mobilize our claim response. And while there is always the potential for us to have outsize exposure to an event, those efforts contributed to losses for us from hurricane Ian that based on current estimates are favorable relative to our corresponding market share. That's consistent with our experience over the past five years. Odd share of the industry's property CAT losses over that period has been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share. Our capabilities position us well for a kind of increasing frequency and severity of losses from natural catastrophe. Turning to investments. Our high quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $505 million after-tax for the quarter, reflecting high returns from our fixed income portfolio and positive returns in our non-fixed income portfolio. Our strong operating results over the past few quarters together with our solid balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 7% over the past year, after making important investments in our business and continuing to return excess capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $722 million of excess capital to our shareholders, including $501 million of share repurchases. Turning to the top line. Thanks to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners. We grew net written premiums by 10% this quarter to a record $9.2 billion. In business insurance net written premiums grew by 9%. Renewal premium change was very strong at an historically high 10.2%, while pure renewal rate change of 5% was higher than in the first half of the year. Retention remained very strong at 86%. And new business increased 9% in the prior year period. Underneath the headline numbers, execution in terms of rate and retention at a segmented level continued to be exceptional. In Bond & Specialty Insurance net written premiums increased by 8% driven by excellent production in both our surety and management liability businesses. Surety net written premiums were up 18%. Management liability premiums were up 4%, driven by renewal premium change of 9%, retention that increased to 89% and 20% growth in new business. In Personal Insurance, renewal premium change was meaningfully higher both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to address the environmental headwinds. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to comment on a public policy issue. Hurricane Ian puts a spotlight on the troubled condition of the Florida insurance market. Other states may be headed for similar challenges. As policymakers consider how best to address the availability and affordability of insurance, we would urge them to consider the impacts of the unhealthy tort environment, fraud and abuse by a few that impact too many and regulatory practices that undermine free market principles. I believe those factors are at least as consequential as the weather itself to the industry's ability to provide our communities with effective and efficient ways to manage risk. We're looking forward to being a participant in constructive conversations about solutions in the days ahead. Something's up building on our strong results so far this year, we're confident about our outlook. Our commercial lines businesses are generating terrific results for achieving meaningful price increases in personal lines. And our high quality investment portfolio is poised to generate meaningfully higher levels of fixed income NII going forward. When we combine that and the success we've had with our performance transform called action. We're very confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $526 million and core return on equity was 7.9%. On a year-to-date basis, core ROE as a healthy 10.9%. Our after-tax underlying underwriting gain of $478 million was once again very strong. We generated the record earned premium and reported an underlying combined ratio of 92.5%. In both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty, the underlying combined ratios were particularly good and improved from the prior year quarter. While in personal insurance, the underlying combined ratio was elevated. Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segments results in a few minutes. The expense ratio for the quarter of 28.1% was our best ever quarterly results, having improved 1.3 points from last year's third quarter. As a reminder, the expense ratio has improved even as we continue to increase our significant investment in strategic initiatives. With the improvement driven by our focus on productivity and efficiency coupled with strong top line growth. In our earnings call last quarter, we told you that we expected the expense ratio to be around 29% for the full year. And with the year-to-date expense ratio at 28.7%, it looks like we'll do a little better than 29%. Our third quarter results include $512 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses with $326 million related to hurricane Ian. We hold ourselves accountable for managing our CAT exposures over time. And Ian is another illustration of our industry leading expertise. As you heard from Alan, based on available industry estimates for Ian, Travelers share of losses looks to be well below our weighted average market share in the affected states. The investments we've made in talent, technology and sophisticated peril-by-peril modeling are paying off in terms of risk selection, pricing segmentation, risk mitigation, and our industry leading claim response capabilities. Regarding CAT losses and reinsurance on a year-to-date basis through September 30th, we've accumulated $1.4 billion of qualifying losses for the aggregate retention of $2 billion on our property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty. A couple of additional comments on reinsurance. Based on what we're hearing from the reinsurance community, it sounds like the market is in for higher pricing and capacity constraints. In terms of primary carriers, that's going to impact some much more than others. For two reasons, we would expect to be less impacted than others. First, as a disciplined gross line underwriter, we just don't buy that much reinsurance compared to many others. Second, we have a long track record of strong underwriting performance, consistently outperforming the industry. The upshot of those factors is that we generally expect to be able to obtain the reinsurance coverage we need at acceptable prices. Also, because we're less reliant on reinsurance, we should be less affected by price increases and capacity constraints. With less of an impact on our cost structure, we should have the option to expand our margin advantage or to reflect that cost advantage in our pricing, making us more competitive for attractive new business opportunities. Turning to prior year reserve development, we had total net favorable development of $20 million pre-tax in the third quarter. In Business Insurance net unfavorable PYD of $61 million was driven by a $212 million charge related to our annual asbestos review, largely offset by better than expected loss experienced in workers comp across a number of accident years, as well as favorable development in property. In Bond & Specialty net favorable PYD of $63 million was driven by better than expected results in fidelity and surety as well as the management liability plug. Personal Insurance had $18 million of net favorable PYD with modest movements in both auto and home. One additional comment on asbestos. Loss activity and the level of deaths related to measles silioma [ph] did moderate somewhat in the most recent data available for review, but not to the degree we had projected. Nonetheless, the long-term trend is that measles silioma mortality rates are declining. After tax net investment income decreased by 22% from the prior year quarter to $505 million. As expected, returns in our non-fixed income portfolio were below last year's excellent results. Although we were pleased that the alternative portfolio generated positive income, despite the significant downturn in the broader equity markets. Fixed maturity NII was higher than in the prior year quarter, reflecting both the higher level of invested assets and the impact of higher yields. With interest rates having moved higher during the third quarter, we are again raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short term securities to approximately $500 million after tax in the fourth quarter, and approximately $540 million on average per quarter in 2023, with an estimated $515 million in the first quarter, growing to an estimated $570 million in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of September 30th, were about a 150 basis points higher than what is embedded in the portfolio. And with rates having moved up again in October, a difference is now around 200 basis points. As it relates to our non-fixed income investments. Let me take this opportunity to remind you that results for our private equities, real estate partnerships and hedge funds are generally reported to us on a one quarter lag. Since our non-fixed income returns tend to directionally follow the broader equity markets, we expect the downturn experienced by the broader market in the third quarter to impact our fourth quarter results. Turning to Capital Management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.5 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than our target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of more than $1.4 billion. Interest rates increased and spreads continue to widen during the quarter and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.8 billion after tax at June 30 to $6.3 billion after tax at September 30. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We regularly hold fixed income investments to maturity, the quality of our fixed income portfolio is as always very high. And changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on the expected cash flow from those investments, our statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $111.90 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end and up 7% from a year-ago. We returned $722 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $501 million and dividends of $221 million. We have approximately $2.5 billion of capacity remaining under the most recent share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. To sum it all up, we had another very good quarter in light of the impact from Ian, but strong premium growth in all three segments, terrific underlying underwriting profitability in our commercial businesses, and further improvement to our outlook for fixed income NII. All of that, combined with another quarter of progress on important strategic initiatives has us well positioned to continue to grow at attractive returns. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for discussion of Business Insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had an excellent quarter with segment income of $471 million. We're particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio, which improved to 90% for the quarter. This result is a testament to our execution and focus on achieving our target returns. The underlying loss ratio increased by about a point as the benefit of earned pricing was more than offset by the comparison to both the low level of property losses and the favorable impact associated with the pandemic in the prior year quarter. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was more than offset by a lower expense ratio that benefited from our ongoing strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. Net written premiums of $4.4 billion were up 9% over the prior year quarter, with growth in all domestic markets and lines of business. Premiums benefited from strong renewal premium change and retention, both of which were once again historically high, as well as higher levels of new business. Turning to domestic production for the quarter, renewal premium change of 10.2% was once again exceptionally strong. RPC included renewal rate change of 5%, a tick up from the second quarter and strong exposure growth. Retention remained very strong at 86% and new business premium was more than $500 million, up 9% over the prior year. We're pleased with the strong production results and the excellent execution by our colleagues in the field. Given our high quality book, as well as several years of segmented rate increases, and improvements in terms and conditions, we're thrilled to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. The rate gains we achieved in the quarter reflect our deliberate execution, which balanced the persistent headwinds and uncertainty in the current environment with the improvement in profitability across our portfolio after several years of strong pricing. As always, we'll continue to execute our granular pricing, careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sub-limits and exclusions to maintain profitable growth. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remains healthy at 10.6%, while retention of 83% was up two points from the prior year quarter. New business was up 8% from the prior year quarter, driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In middle market, renewal premium change remained very strong at over 9%, while retention was higher year-over-year and sequentially at an excellent 89%. New business premium of $271 million was up 5% over the prior year. To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution and driving strong financial results while continuing to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty had an outstanding quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $242 million, up 39% from the prior year quarter, driven by record underlying underwriting income, and a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio was a terrific 78.4% and improvement of five points from the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of earned pricing and about a two point impact from the favorable re-estimation of losses for the first two quarters of 2022. Turning to the top line, net written premiums grew 8% in the quarter to a record high with contributions from all our businesses. Domestic Surety grew an outstanding 18% in the quarter driven by larger average bond premiums. Domestic management liability renewal premium change remains strong at 9% while we improve retention by a point to a terrific 89%. We're also pleased that we increase new business 20% from the prior year quarter, as we leverage the investments we've made and continue to make in our competitive advantages to grow these profitable businesses. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were again terrific this quarter, reflecting continued excellent execution across our business and the value of our market leading products and services to our customers and distribution partners. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Personal Insurance reported a combined ratio of 107.2% up approximately two and a half points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by a higher underlying combined ratio. The four point increase in the underlying combined ratio reflects the continuing environmental challenge of elevated loss severity in both automobile and homeowners. The loss impacts were partially offset by a two point reduction in the expense ratio. For the quarter, catastrophe losses were $285 million and included losses from Hurricane Ian, most of which are Florida automobile losses. Catastrophes were two points lower than the prior year quarter, which included Hurricane Ida. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 13% primarily driven by very strong price increases in both domestic automobile and Homeowners & Other. In automobile, the third quarter combined ratio was 112.2%, including nearly eight points of catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 103.9%, an increase of 6.9 points relative to the prior year quarter. The increase reflects another quarter of elevated vehicle replacement and repair costs, and to a lesser extent the continued return toward pre-pandemic driving and claim frequency levels. Our primary response to these environmental challenges is higher pricing. We were pleased with our progress this quarter building out our actions to increase rates over the past few quarters. While pricing continues to gain momentum, it will still take some time for rate actions to fully earn into our results. In Homeowners & Other, the third quarter combined ratio was 102.3% and improvement relative to the third quarter of 2021 as catastrophe losses in property were lower. The underlying combined ratio of 94.9% increased about a point and a half from the prior year quarter. We continue to experience higher loss severity related to a combination of labor and material price increases in the quarter. But that loss pressure was largely offset by the current quarter benefit of earned pricing, lower non-catastrophe weather losses and a lower expense ratio. Turning to quarterly production, we continue to make excellent progress and achieving pricing increases. I'll discuss Homeowners & Other production first this morning before spending a bit more time on automobile. For Domestic Homeowners & Other, renewal premium change increased to 14.1% and retention decreased slightly to 83% both consistent with our expectations. We expect renewal premium change to continue at these levels for the remainder of 2022. Looking ahead to 2023, we expect renewal premium change to increase above these already very strong levels, as we implement additional insured value increases. For domestic automobile, renewal premium change increased to 8.1%, while retention was 83% also consistent with our expectations. During the quarter, we implemented price increases in 26 states at an average of about 8.5%. We expect that domestic automobile renewal premium change will get into double-digits in the fourth quarter and be in the mid-teens throughout 2023. Written pricing should reach adequacy in most states representing the majority of our business between now and mid-2023 and that pricing will earn into our results over time. In addition to increased pricing, we're also implementing additional non-rate actions, including further tightening underwriting criteria, restricting binding authority for certain agents in certain states, and removing our auto product from comparative riders in California and Florida. These actions will help us manage growth and improve profitability. Personal Insurance has a strong track record of financial performance demonstrated by over 40% net written premium growth and 97% combined ratio for the five-year period from 2017 to 2021. While we and the industry continue to face near-term environmental headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive returns over time, while continuing to build the business for the future. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. And we are ready to open up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'm going to start out with the expense ratio improvement. Dan, you talked about it being a combination of top line productivity and efficiency. And now the target is a little bit below 29 for the year, maybe you could give us a breakdown of where the improvements are coming from? And more importantly, it seems like the trend is going to continue. The trend of improvement should continue beyond just this year. Maybe you can comment a little bit on that.\nDan Frey: Sure, Greg. It's pretty broad based and it's sort of the continuation of the theme that we've seen, really now for the past three, or four, or even five years of making important investments in strategic initiatives. At the same time, we focus on productivity and efficiency, and grow the top line in all three segments. So what you see is just a consistent pattern of expense increases at a rate that's well below the rate that we're growing, growing the top line. In terms of, whether we expect that continue or providing outlook going forward, we'd said probably a year and a half ago or so that we've gotten down to 30. And we were pretty comfortable at that level, then we said we got down to 29. And we were going to be pretty comfortable with that level. At 28.7 on a year-to-date basis, I'd still put that in the around 29 bucket. As Alan has talked about many times what we liked about our focus on productivity and efficiency and expenses is it gives us optionality, we can continue to make important investments, which we will, we could let it drop to the bottom line, we could reflect it in more competitive pricing, and there's no reason for us. And we're not going to declare at this point, what we think that's going to look like next year or a year or two out. So I'd suffice it to say that in the 29 neighborhood is a number that we're still pretty comfortable with and 28.7 through the first nine months feels really good.\nGregory Peters: Thanks, thanks for the answer. I guess the second question will be just on reinsurance. And I know you're pretty upfront in your record of being a gross line underwriter stands out, stands by itself. So I guess when I think of the treaties you do have in place like the aggregate XOL treaty, and whatever access loss property cover you have in place, you mentioned that pricing is probably going to change for the market next year. What are you hearing about how those particular programs for The Travelers might evolve? And I guess what I'm getting at is, should we expect increased retentions for The Travelers in '23 and '24's result?\nDan Frey: I think Greg, too early to say. We'll talk about the one-one renewals when we know how things turned out, which we'll do probably at the -- in the fourth quarter call. I like the point of the comments today, we're really to just reinforce for folks that one, we're not a big user of reinsurance, especially relative to some other parts of the market; and two, our track record and our long tenure with a lot of our trading partners, as is pretty confident that we're going to be able to place what we want to place at appropriate prices, the CAT aggregate XOL treaty, specifically, we've said -- I think we've said, every year we had it. We'd either buy it or not, depending on what we thought the pricing level was relative to our own appetite. And you've seen us place anywhere from 55% of that treaty to 85% of that treaty, depending on the pricing environment. And if there's a year where we decide to not place any of it, we'll be perfectly fine with that. But that's a decision we'll make as we go through the renewal process.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Greg it's Alan. I would just add to that, to Dan's point, whether retentions go up or they don't go up who knows. But I think the important point is, given the strategic way we think about reinsurance and given the strength of our underwriting, we're going to have the flexibility to make the right decision for our business.\nGregory Peters: Makes sense. Thanks, Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, so hurricane Ian, right seems like it's going to be a pretty large event. I know you guys talked about below market share, but insured losses, probably $50 billion to $60 billion, which I think really as the impact to move pricing. So I was hoping to get your view there, Alan. And then, if you can tie that back, you guys did make a comment about right being a little less reliant on what's happening in the reinsurance markets who can be more competitive on the pricing front? So how do you think price plays out given this large event and in the reinsurance dynamic as well?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, good morning, Elyse, and thank you. Just to start with basics, pricing is a function of rate adequacy. And given what we all expect to happen to reinsurance, there's going to be a rate need. On top of that, certainly as it relates to property, there's going to be capacity constraints that are -- that will be significant, I suspect across the market. And I think on top of those things, which are probably largely quantifiable, it was just a big storm, maybe rivaling Katrina. And that's just going to impact the way that the market thinks about risk. So we would expect that constellation factors to put certainly upward pressure on property pricing and potentially extended to other aspects of the market as well, we'll see. But certainly, as it relates to property, we would expect there to be upward pressure on pricing.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, you guys called out the impact of the favorable accident, your adjustment within management liability? Could you give us more details on what drove that the specific lines? And was that better frequency or severity driven?\nDan Frey: Yes, Elyse, it's Dan. I don't think we're going to parse it out finer than that. We have a loss pick at the start of the year, we'll look at it as we get to the midpoint of the year. And then each of the bad couple of quarters of the year the short answer is things have just come in a little better than we would have expected based on the plan. And so that's what we're reflecting in this quarter's results.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nDan Frey: Thanks Elyse.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Just a couple for me. So the -- Dan, you're talking about the NII guidance and our rates have moved since 930. Is that guide trued up for where we are today in terms of rates or is that just as of where new money was at 930?\nDan Frey: You're getting a little fine there Ryan, in terms of whether we're going to change it every two weeks. We've seen rates move up and down a little bit. It's been fairly volatile in the last 30 days. I would say, generally speaking, it's reflective of the current environment, and I wouldn't put a specific date on it.\nRyan Tunis: Okay. And then I think the CAT number in auto was higher than we've seen. How much of that $133 million auto CATs is from Ian? And I guess I'm just curious how certain is that estimate at this point? Is that pretty much a ground up loss or in a lot of that IBNR kind of based off of like an industry view, if that makes sense?\nDan Frey: Sure. So it's Dan, I'll start and Michael can chime in if you want. I think we feel pretty good about that number. We watched it very closely and very carefully, as you would imagine, given the unfortunate timing, not only the unfortunate event itself, but the unfortunate timing for those of us who are accountants and actuaries trying to come up with an estimate at the end of the quarter. But we watched it all the way through the first week of October made our best estimate. At this point, a lot of it's unpaid. We look at the data, the way it continued to develop all the way through, frankly, the time we're getting ready to push the button on reporting earnings. And what came in was pretty consistent with what we'd expected before. But to be clear, we're doing it based on what we think our exposure is in the footprint of the event, and the weight claims have actually come in a couple of weeks. Since then, it's not the blunt instrument have just taken an industry estimate and ours expected market share.\nMichael Klein: Yes. And Ryan, it's Michael. I would just add part of the question might be the number relative to some of the external estimates that have been floating around for auto. And frankly, given our footprint inside Florida, we weren't surprised. And I mean, strategically, we for a while have been avoiding Southern Florida. So that means you're going to push your market share to a more -- a higher level than your statewide average in the places that you're still riding. So in the context of that in our local market share and our strategy in Florida, the numbers not surprising.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on the business insurance underlying loss ratio, and there was definitely some noise in last year's quarter. So it's -- just wondering if you could clarify, if we look at the underlying loss ratio and business insurance, how much of a benefit earned pricing was during the quarter? And then maybe just talk about your view of that going forward? I know, Alan, you mentioned some uncertainty in the environment. So maybe just some high level comments around that as well.\nDan Frey: Sure. David, it's Dan, I'll start. So as Greg gave you in his script, last year there was some good news from non-CAT property losses, and a little bit of what we felt was favorable impact related to the COVID environment. So we don't have that in this year. We do have some benefit of price versus trend, as you've seen over the last year or so and rate number come down, that number has trended down, it's now something less than a point. We're not really going to put a -- put an outlook projection on it. But you can see what rates done and exposure have done in the last few quarters. And that's been pretty steady. The only other comment I'd make related to that is, while there was noise in last year's quarter, we don't think there's a lot of noise in this year's quarter. So that's why Greg didn't really call anything out as unusual in terms of what's in this year's underlying loss ratio.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And then maybe, if you could just talk about Alan, and maybe Greg, just talk about how your view of the rate environment in BI has changed over the last three months. And I know you guys don't typically do this, but I'm wondering if you could just give some color around rate movement by line sort of high level. I know, Alan, you just spoke about on the property side. But maybe just wondering some of the other lines and sort of how you're thinking about that going forward. Do you think we continue to see an acceleration here?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, David, let me start. And then I'll look to Greg to add anything he'd like to add. I would describe the pricing environment as strong. Overall commercial pricing is near record levels. The breadth of the pricing gains are very good. We always look at retention to give us a sign on the strength of pricing retention, really hasn't budged, it's hanging in there at very high numbers. The strong pricing led by property auto umbrella be on primary GL. So it's broad based in it at overall pricing levels that we would say are near records. You heard me say that that from here, we would expect there to be some upward pressure on pricing and property. The other end of the spectrum, you've got workers comp, where we'd expect more of the same. And the other lines will fall in between those two, reflecting the two factors that Greg mentioned, on the one hand, we continue to have headwinds from inflation and supply chain disruption and whether social inflation, reinsurance et cetera. And on the other hand, we've had pretty good pricing for a number of years that that has improved the overall returns of the portfolio. So I would say those other lines in between will reflect the balance of those two dynamics.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thank you.\nDan Frey: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. Your line is open.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, Greg, good morning. First question regarding capital management, if I look at kind of year-to-date dividends and repurchases. It looks like you've given back on a 100% ish of operating income, despite very strong top line growth. I feel like I recall, maybe it was a year ago or more, you talked about kind of making us kind of take into account that you needed to support that strong top line growth, which just continued to accelerate. So any thoughts there on whether you can continue to buyback at such a high ratio?\nDan Frey: Mike, it's Dan. Thank you very much for listening to me two years ago, appreciate it. That's still the theme, I think that we -- that we'll follow here we're going to be very strongly capitalized. Nonetheless, the business does continue to generate excess capital. We'll look to deploy that excess capital if we can in a way that generates attractive returns. And when we think we've exhausted all those opportunities, we're going to do what we've done for the last 15 years and continue to give it back to shareholders. It is hard to look at, any one year or in this case, less than a year and do the ratio of buybacks and dividends relative to core income and draw a conclusion. We have said historically, and I would repeat here, it will not and cannot be a 100% going forward. We are going to need to hold on to some capital to support the business growth. What we've done this year is partly a function of where we ended 2021 with really strong performance, especially in the third and fourth quarters of 2021. That put us in the position that we started the year with probably a very robust capital position.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay, that's helpful. My last question, just kind of back to the David's question and your remarks on just the overall kind of competitive environment. How does Travelers think about the dynamic of meaningfully improved new money rates on investment income? I mean, does that kind of allow you to The Travelers or you have to fill up maybe the industry to allow that kind of let off the gas on pricing? Or is it just kind of rates have been so volatile over the last many, including today that it's tough to kind of bake in the expectation that rates stay? They so high, stay at current levels? Any thoughts there? Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure. So the rate levels do impact our view of the outlook for net investment income, which you have heard from Dan. And there is some judgment involved in how much of that we put into our pricing model. But there's two things you got to keep in mind in terms of the impact of interest rates on pricing. One is that earns in overtime into the investment portfolio, because you got such a small portion of it turning over in any one year. And two, our -- what we've got mid-teens return equity objective over time. When we think about the near term, it's really we think about it as a margin over the risk free rate. And so as those interest rates go up, certainly as a function of the risk free rate, we're also increasing our return objectives. And so it's just not as simple as looking at it saying GI, investment incomes going up, pricing is coming down. It's a little bit more of a complicated assessment. And I would say the takeaway is, certainly in the short term, we wouldn't expect a very significant impact.\nDan Frey: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple of them here. First, Michael, I'm just curious in your comments you talked about -- it sounds like reducing kind of your appetite on the personal auto line of business by getting off of some comparative riders et cetera, et cetera. Is that kind of where you're alluding to, because I look at your PIF growth continued to grow in personal auto. Should that kind of you think reverse trend here, as you really focus on getting profitability back in that area, that line?\nDan Frey: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. I think what I would say is again, we're really focused on improving profitability. We're working to manage growth as we do that. That said in the majority of jurisdictions, we have a pretty good line of sight to rate adequacy. And so in those jurisdictions, while we're renewing accounts and writing new business for the most part we're comfortable with what's going on. The couple of jurisdictions that I did spike out are a little bit challenging in that regard. In Florida, there's currently a moratorium on file and use for a price increases, which is a change in their regulatory approach to rate filings. And in California, the Department of Insurance is still not considering auto rate increases. And so in those two states in particular, that really was what drove our decision to come off the comparative riders. Other than that, most of those actions are things that we do in the normal course that we're being a bit more aggressive on in places where profitability is challenged. But again, in most jurisdictions, we're comfortable, we're either getting or going to get the rate we think we need and focused on that and letting the growth come through. So that's really what I was trying to trying to reflect there, if that makes sense.\nBrian Meredith: Got you. Yes, that makes sense. And then Alan, a bigger picture question. I may have asked this before, but just maybe remind us, Travelers is obviously a phenomenal standard commercial lines carrier. But just looking at what happened with Hurricane Ian and the complexities of risks that continue to emerge. Give us your thoughts on whether Travelers needs to be more active, or in the Excess & Surplus lines market, if there's opportunities for you all there to maybe grow or do something?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, thanks for that, Brian. So two different questions do we need to be? No, I think we've got, all the tools in the toolkit to be successful. So there's something we need to do there, is it an opportunity, sure it could be. And I would just start by saying we already have meaningful E&S capabilities. So we've got our Northfield business. We've got Lloyd's franchise, we've got E&S capabilities in our core business, we probably write a quarter of our national property business on E&S Paper, we're doing a lot in our management liability business through E&S. So we've got a lot of E&S capability. And the ability to be creative inside our many of our admitted products, too. And so we've got a lot of flexibility to do what we want to do. So, often if we lose an opportunity to the E&S market, it's often because we don't like the risk reward equation, not because we can't do it. Having said that, over time, could there be opportunities for us to strategically expand in E&S, sure there could be. It's not anything that we feel like we can't be successful in creating shareholder value. We've got a terrific business model, and we're very comfortable with it, but sure there can be more opportunity.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Shanker: Yes, changing gears a little bit, maybe a question for David and Daniel. Is there any thoughts about crystallizing some investment losses for an opportunity redeploying the capital at a higher yield? Is there any penalty for doing that? How do you think about redeployment prematurely selling a bond at this point in time?\nDan Frey: Josh, it's Dan, I'll start and I think Dave Rowland is on the line. And Dave could jump in as well. Other than really selectively, selling individual securities that we think are at a position where it would make sense to sell them and we could redeploy the money in a new preferable instrument that's not really been part of our strategy. We're taking a long-term view of how we manage a very high quality asset portfolio. Again, the unrealized loss doesn't cause us any concern. If we think there was significant economic value available, that's where you're going to see us make some trades, but for us, that's a very small percentage of the portfolio. I would simply say don't expect to see us make a wholesale turn over in the portfolio to realize a bunch of losses and then take higher yields on the money going forward and think economically, that's sort of a wash. And we're looking at what's best for the company from an economic perspective.\nJoshua Shanker: All right. And another easy question. Historically, you guys have a wonderful job of being fairly conservative about your catastrophe picks early on, and they've generally matured favorably, as time has gone on. When you have prior year favorable reserve development on a catastrophe, does that show up in your P&L as a negative CAT or as prior-year development?\nDan Frey: It shows as prior year reserve development.\nJoshua Shanker: Okay, that's it. Thank you very much.\nDan Frey: Thanks, Josh.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thanks. Good morning. First question, I think is for Michael, where you've talked about states where you're either at adequacy or you have line of sight. When you talk about anticipating double-digit premium increases in 2023, and we combined that with the policy enforced growth that we've seen so far this year. Can we infer that you'll underwrite business that's not adequately priced now, if there is line of sight to adequate pricing?\nMichael Klein: Yes, thanks, Meyer. Good question. I mean, I think the way I would just describe it, let me parse it out right. So you're looking at RPC numbers in the production highlights that reflect the written impact of the rate that we've taken on the renewal book, as the policies renew. And so the first point I'd make is when you're looking at those numbers, they're a bit of a lagging indicator of the price that we've actually gotten filed and approved with the Departments of Insurance. And so when I describe the outlook that says that we believe we're going to be adequate in most states that reflect the majority of our business by mid-year, next year, I'm talking about that written price level, at the point in time, we get that rate approval. And again, what I would say is, if we're confident that we're going to get the rates to where we want them to be, then yes, we'll renew business in the ordinary course. And we'll continue to be open for new business. Again, in most jurisdictions where we have that confidence, and by the way in most jurisdictions, that next rate increase is a single-digit number. So it's not that we're talking about a significant number of places where we're double-digit rate away from adequacy. In fact, the 8.5% increase in the 26 states that average increase across 26 states that I talked about this quarter, most of those states are additional increases on top of increases we've already gotten. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a flavor for our both our philosophy but also in places where we aren't necessarily adequate for how far away we think we are.\nMeyer Shields: No, that was very thorough, very helpful. Thank you. And then question for Alan, I know it's early in the process of Florida getting its act together, is there any receptivity to having the legislative reforms that you've talked about?\nAlan Schnitzer: Receptivity in the State of Florida?\nMeyer Shields: Yes, among the legislature?\nAlan Schnitzer: I'm probably not the right person to speak on behalf of the Florida Legislature. I do think that there's recognition that there's an issue there and in recent months, they have made some progress, I think, probably not enough. But I suspect they're getting to a point where something's got to give, but I certainly shouldn't speak on behalf of them.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, no, asking from your perspective, but I understand. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: The answer is, I hope so.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that's fair.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Meyer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is open.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Good morning. Dan, following up on your comments about reinsurance pricing and capacity constraints. So on a speeding perspective, when you were choosing reinsurance partner, I assume you're looking at balance sheet strength, in doing so are you excluding unrealized losses on investments? Are you looking through that as you determine who participates on your panel and also to determine their related participation?\nDan Frey: I would say Tracy, we're looking at the long-term economic viability of our trading partners and the likelihood and confidence that we're going to get collected. So, to the degree that if someone else's in an unrealized loss position for a similar reason that we're in an unrealized loss position, meaning it is not credit driven, it is not investment portfolio property driven, it is nothing other than a function of the change in interest rates, which will definitively will reverse itself over time, then from an economic value perspective, I think for the most part, we're going to look through that.\nTracy Benguigui: Very helpful. When I first heard of your objective of closing 90% of your property claims within 30 days, I was thinking, Gee, that could really contain loss creep. But is there anything in the litigation side or regulatory side in Florida, given Alan your public policy announcement that can impede your ability to meet that objective as it relates to Ian specifically?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think right now, Tracy, we feel pretty good about our ability to get to that level. And in fact, we had that objective in place for several years. And we're routinely successful in meeting that objective, and there's always litigation of one sort or another. And so I don't, I would expect that we'll get there. I mean, we're not there yet. So who knows, but I would expect we'll get there.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. My question is, I guess, a little color on the Bond & Specialty outlook would be wonderful. Is there any reason why either business mix change or anything that's changing that business, the underwriting performance shouldn't somewhat track sort of economic and credit quality? I think of that as a credit business. But maybe things have changed.\nJeffrey Klenk: Yes, this is Jeff. Paul, thanks for the question. We don't give a lot of outlook relative to the Bond & Specialty business. But I would re-emphasize what you said it is a credit business, we feel really good about the underlying profitability of both the Surety and the management liability components of that business. And we continue to invest for growth. So I probably leave it at that. And thanks for the question.\nAlan Schnitzer: I guess probably the other thing I would add is you could go back to the 2008 financial crisis, you could go back to the pandemic, I mean, this portfolio has been challenged in other difficult credit environments. And it's performed extraordinarily well. And it's the same underwriting philosophy. It's the same tools, it's the same et cetera. And so, we don't look at this, if you're thinking, we could be in for bumpy economic times ahead. We agree with that. But we're confident in this business and the way we manage it.\nPaul Newsome: No, I agree. It's extraordinary track record, I'm just wondering in your profitability that is unique, even for what Travelers have seen in the past. So I'm not actually suggesting that that could be a horrible quarter. I'm just thinking whether or not the current sustained, extraordinary profitability is sustainable. But second question, I wanted to ask about the just CAT exposures in general, as kind of looking back over many years, and it looks like there was, it looks like there might have been a reduction in kind of your general view of exposures of CATs. And what you want to take on relative to your business in total, but there's been so much noise over the last three years, that's hard to tell if that's really the case. And obviously, we have to have sort of an expectation to normalize CAT load. But are you essentially not changing this stuff, is your sort of appetite for CAT exposure. And I really want to talk about just next quarter, but over the years has the appetite changed at all for Travelers?\nAlan Schnitzer: Not really, Paul, when we think about our -- we write plenty of CAT exposed business and there hasn't been a really significant overall portfolio level shift. I mean, certainly, we found some geographies more attractive than others, and we've moved capital around from that perspective. But we haven't in a meaningful wholesale way withdrawn from CAT exposure, nor do we feel the need to do that going forward, we've been, I think going back probably five years taking a very thoughtful approach to taking a step back. And we've put dedicated teams in place for every peril and our objective was to be the leader and understanding the science behind that peril and the underwriting around that peril, and also to develop extraordinarily claim handling capabilities for those events. And I think that's really what's paid off for us. I don't think it's been a meaningful withdrawal from the exposure.\nPaul Newsome: Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats on the quarter.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for putting me in. I guess in this question given all the comments that Dan made in the opening comments about property CAT and reinsurance pricing. Maybe answers here would be more of an industry level what you think industry does, but if you want to put in what you do that that's fine, too. But theoretically, if we're paying more for property CAT reinsurance, will that translate into us charging more for our BI casualty business? Is it no, because that they're separate businesses? Yes its cost of doing business? Or is there is kind of some threshold that maybe we can make spills over into our casualty primary book that what we charge there. I know you downplay the impact on profit CAT reinsurance for you guys. But maybe your own views there or what you think the industry might do there?\nAlan Schnitzer: I'm looking at Greg, I do think that every product or the exposure sort of stands on its own. But at the same time, I think there's overall psyche in the market, and a reaction to the overall level of risk that that we perceive in the marketplace. And so is there some of that that carries over? And to what extent that the reinsurance pricing carries over, we'll find out, but it may be that that's a contributor to casualty pricing, moving up a little bit, but I think on the whole I would expect these lines to stand on their own grant.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes, I think that's the case so Alan. And that really will be reinsured by reinsurer if they think about account pricing or individual line, but balance point I think most are so discipline, they're going to be looking at the line. And just as a reminder, casualty has its own headwinds with social inflation and the reinsurer certainly had been addressing some of that incremental risk as we have on the growth side also.\nAlan Schnitzer: That's a good point, Greg.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, yes. Thanks. That makes sense. And second, I guess there's been so much talk, obviously on the headlines from personal auto. But I guess, could you say what you're seeing on the commercial side for auto in terms of just loss trends there and kind of where rate adequacy is today?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes, sure, Michael. We're making good progress that overall on the auto in terms of your question relative to personal auto, we're certainly not immune from some of the severity challenges Michael and his team are experiencing. And you can think of two cohorts of vehicles on commercial private passenger light vehicles, think light trucks, vans and that sort. And then you have the heavy vehicles. And so we're seeing a little more of that severity pressure on that first cohort that has some of the same supply and demand dynamics that that Michael's feeling, but we're continuing to make good progress on pricing and underwriting and as I share that at the recent Investor Day, we're bringing out a new auto product that we think is going to be really segmented and help us with our prospects even more.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Scott: Hey, thanks for putting me in here. First one I have for you is just a high level question on loss costs. And I've been just interested in your updated views on how you know what we're seeing in CPI inflation and how that translates to actual insurance claims inflation for the business insurance business. And just as that's evolving, things like medical costs inflation not running away from us or something, but beginning to take up a little more. Are you having to evolve your view of those things in a bigger way or do you still view that as CPI prints getting worse, you're not really fully translate into insurance claims costs?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Alex, we are always evaluating that. Practically on a daily basis, and we did increase our severity trend assumptions back in the first quarter. And then we did that with a degree of caution, knowing that there was a fair amount of uncertainty out there. And what we've seen subsequent to that in the second quarter, and again, this quarter was consistent with those expectations. So it's not that we're not seeing or feeling that severity coming through. We are, but it's within the expectations that we established back in the first quarter. Now, as it relates to medical inflation, you can't really focus on the medical CPI. Because, workers comp is different, right? We're treating workplace injuries, we're not treating chronic diseases. So the components of medical inflation, that impact workers comp are probably inflating it at a lower rate than the overall medical CPI. And my comment on overall workers comp loss trend is it continues to be benign.\nAlex Scott: Got it. That's helpful. And follow-up question I had is on the unit exposure increases, I'd imagine that the sort of real unit exposure increases the economy strength and maybe help you a little more than, just the insured value and inflation sort of impact. I think through price rate acting, or the unit exposure acting is rate. I mean, can you help me think is, is we've approach periods of time where you're lapping pretty strong economic growth. I mean, do the benefits that you get from unit exposure increases begin to erode. And is that still far enough out in the future that it's not a concern for now as we head into next year? Or is that something we need to think harder about as we get to sort of 1Q, 2Q next year?\nAlan Schnitzer: So I'm not sure that I exactly get the question, Alex, but I'll make a few comments. And if I don't get to the answer that you're looking for, let me know. But as we shared many times over more than a decade, exposure growth does contribute to margins. And there's two types of -- really two types of exposure growth, there's true unit growth, and then there's inflation. And in particular, the inflation side of exposure is a more meaningful contributor to margin than true unit growth, because that unit growth does come with some risk content. I do think the unit growth also contributes to margins, by the way, but not at the same level that inflation does. And so to the extent that continues to come in, and we'll see what happens with the economy, and we'll see what happens to exposure over time. But to the extent that does come in, it will continue to contribute to margins. Is that helpful?\nAlex Scott: Yes, that does clarify. Thank you for entertaining the question. Appreciate it.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Ward: Hey guys, thanks. Just last one on workers comp. Growth tailed off a bit in 3Q, just wondering if there was anything to read into there from a macro perspective? And I guess, wondering along those lines, to what extent did -- would you say mix contributed to your rate acceleration in 3Q? Thanks.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Michael, it's Greg. Yes, there wasn't really any material change in workers comp for this quarter across business insurances. As Alan said, it has continued to be the laggard in terms of pricing, but again driven based on industry and certainly Travelers profitability of that line. So no real material change there. Obviously, we're getting some strong exposure growth. And that's why we're getting an overall lift in written premium there. So nothing to look into other than where the run rate has been.\nAlan Schnitzer: And on your last question, the overall mix was not a contributor in any meaningful way to the overall rate number. It was broad based.\nMichael Ward: Thank you, guys.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: And this brings us to the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Abbe Goldstein for some final closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much. We appreciate your time this morning. And as always, if there is any follow-up, please reach out directly to Investor Relations. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 2, "year": 2022, "date": "2022-07-21 13:05:21", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the second quarter results teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 21, 2022.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2022 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.  Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, CFO; and our 3 segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeff Klenk of Specialty Insurance and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions.  Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation.  Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.  We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials in the Investors section on our website.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report a very strong second quarter, including an excellent bottom-line result, double-digit top line growth in all 3 segments, strong and improved profitability in our commercial business segment, progress addressing the rental headwinds facing the personal insurance industry, a meaningful contribution from net investment income and another quarter of progress on a number of important strategic initiatives.  Core income for the quarter was $625 million or $2.50 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 9.3%. These results were driven by record net earned premiums of $8.3 billion, up 9% over the prior year quarter and a solid underlying combined ratio of 92.8% -- environmental issues impacting insurance industry, consolidated results reflect the benefit of our diversified portfolio of businesses.  For the 6 months, core -- was ahead of the prior year at $1.66 billion, an excellent first half result. We're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying results for our commercial businesses. Looking at the 2 commercial businesses together, the combined BI-BSI underlying combined ratio of 2.7% for the quarter, an improvement of 1 point from the prior year quarter.  Results in Personal Insurance were impacted by elevated severity in both auto and home. As you'll hear from Michael, we're on the right track in addressing the environmental issues. Excellent operations together with our balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 8% over the past year after making important investments in our business, turning excess capital to shareholders.  During the quarter, we returned $725 million of excess capital to our shareholders, including $500 million of share repurchases.  Turning to the top line, thanks to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners, we grew net written premiums by 11% this quarter to a record $9 billion with, as I mentioned, each of our 3 segments growing double digits. In Business Insurance, net working premiums grew by 10%. Renewal premium change was 10.3%. That's the fourth highest quarterly renewal premium change going back more than 15 years. Renewal premium change included renewal rate change of 4.9%. Both measures moved up from the preceding quarter.  Retention remained very strong at 86%. We have a high-quality book of business and keeping it as a priority. Also, as we've shared previously, strong retention is a sign of a rational and stable pricing market.  Underneath the headline numbers, execution in terms of rate retention at a segmented level was excellent. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 13%, driven by excellent production in both our Surety and Management Liability businesses. Surety net written premiums were up 24%. Management Liability premiums were up 7% and driven by a rental premium change of 8.8%, retention that increased to a very strong 88% and strong new business.  In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12%. We know a premium change was meaningfully higher, both year-over-year and sequentially in auto and homeowners as we continue to execute to improve returns. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.  Turning to investments. Our high-quality portfolio generated net investment income of $595 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting reliable results from our fixed income portfolio and another quarter of strong returns from our nonfixed income portfolio.  Speaking of investments, given the potential for a difficult economic environment ahead, we've included on Page 19 of the webcast presentation a slide breaking down the composition of our investment portfolio. Consistent with our long-time focus on risk-adjusted returns, we're underweight compared to most in terms of risk assets as a percentage of shareholders' equity.  Our investment philosophy has served us well over many years and through many different market cycles. It starts with asset allocation. More than 90% of our $80 billion portfolio is invested in fixed income securities. That sets us apart.  Inside that, we also have relatively high allocation to municipal bonds where the default rate has been meaningfully lower as compared to corporate bonds. Even within munis, we're discriminating. We're invested in only about 1,000 municipal issuers out of an estimated 80,000. Virtually all of our municipal bond holdings are rated AA- or higher.  Our corporate bond portfolio is curated with the same level of discipline. Virtually all of it is investment grade. And within that, we are meaningful overweight AA and A credits and meaningfully underweight BBB credit.  During times of economic distress, credit quality is key and in the sometimes foreseeable and sometimes unforeseeable lead up to those times, when spreads widen and volatility increases, the market doesn't allow for a graceful repositioning of a portfolio. So we stay true to the strategy that has served us well over decades.  Our level of actual impairments over a long period of time has been remarkably low. In 2008 and 2009, with the Moody's default percentage reached 2% to 2.5%, our default rate never reached 1%. In the COVID charge turmoil of 2020, when the Moody's default rate at 1%, our portfolio default rate was around 10 basis points.  And given the credit quality of our portfolio, the fact that we hold the vast majority of fixed income investments to maturity, decreases in market value due to rising interest rates as the market is experiencing now have little to no impact on how we run the business or how we view the strength of our capital position.  In terms of our investments in alternative asset class, we don't reach for yield. Our private equity portfolio is well diversified across strategies, sectors and general partners. Our own real estate is high quality and entirely unlevered. And we have little in the way of hedge funds and higher risk assets.  Although we see potential short-term headwinds from recent declines in the equity markets, we also see near-term and potentially ongoing tailwinds from higher interest rates that will benefit our returns going forward. You'll hear from Dan shortly about how the recent rise in interest rates positively impacts our outlook for fixed income NII.  Like everything we do, all starts with our tower. We have a world-class investment team that is responsible for executing on our investment philosophy. Those with position-making authority have worked with us and with each other for an average of around 20 years. That reinforces the long-term perspective we bring to our investment portfolio.  I'm always grateful for their excellent work. But particularly at times like this, I'm reminded of the wisdom of our approach. It has contributed to a long history of industry-leading returns and industry-low volatility.  To sum things up, building on our excellent results in the first half of the year, we're confident about our outlook, benefiting from years of strategic investments as part of our performance transform called action, guided by our decades of experience successfully executing in a variety of macroeconomic conditions and supported by an outlook for improving fixed income returns. We remain well positioned to deliver industry-leading returns and shareholder value over time.  With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDaniel Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the second quarter was $625 million and core return on equity was 9.3%. These results were very strong, especially considering the high level of cat losses, which is typical seasonality for us in the second quarter. While core income declined from the prior year quarter, remember that the prior year quarter included a very benign level of cat losses and record returns from the non-fixed income portfolio.  Our second quarter results include $746 million of pretax catastrophe losses. And while cats were higher year-over-year, they were not outsized relative to our modeled estimates for the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've accumulated $935 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention of $2 billion on our property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty.  Our after-tax underlying underwriting gain of $444 million was down slightly from the prior year quarter. We generated record levels of earned premium and reported an underlying combined ratio of 92.8%. Improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were more than offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in personal insurance. Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes.  At the same time that we continue to make significant investments in strategic initiatives, the second quarter expense ratio improved 70 basis points from last year to 29% driven by the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency and strong top line growth. We had been expecting the full year expense ratio to be around 29.5% but now expected to be more like 29% this year, getting down to that level a little sooner than we had expected.  Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $291 million pretax in the second quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $202 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across a number of accident years and favorable movement in CMP partially offset by an increase in general liability reserves, including for runoff operations.  In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $73 million was driven by better-than-expected results in Fidelity and Surety. Personal Insurance had $16 million of net favorable PYD with modest movement in both auto and home.  After-tax net investment income decreased by 13% from the prior year quarter to $595 million. We were pleased that returns in our nonfixed income portfolio were strong, but as expected, they were less favorable than last year's record quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than in the prior year quarter as the benefit of higher invested assets more than offset the impact of lower average yields during the quarter.  With interest rates having moved higher during the second quarter, we are again raising our outlook for fixed income NII including earnings from short-term securities to approximately $470 million after tax in the third quarter and then to $495 million in the fourth quarter.  New money rates as of June 30 are about 100 basis points higher than what is embedded in the portfolio. So NII should continue to improve as the portfolio gradually turns over and as the portfolio continues to grow. Recall that results for our private equities, real estate partnerships and hedge funds are generally reported to us on a 1-quarter lag. While not perfectly correlated, our non-fixed income returns directionally follow the broader equity markets, which were down significantly during the second quarter.  Through the first half of the year, the S&P 500 was down 21% with about 3/4 of that decline occurring in Q2. Accordingly, we expect that to impact our nonfixed income results next quarter.  Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.4 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. Interest rates increased and spreads continued to widen during the quarter. And as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $1.4 billion after tax at March 31 to $3.8 billion after tax at June 30.  As we've discussed in prior quarters, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We regularly hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains, as Alan discussed, very high. And changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on our statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.  Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $112.37 at quarter end, up 2.4% from year-end and up 8.2% from a year ago. We returned $725 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of $500 million and dividends of $225 million. We have approximately $3 billion of capacity remaining under the most recent share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.  It's also worth noting that in June, we early renewed our $1 billion credit facility for a 5-year term. While the size of the facility and the group of participating banks was unchanged, we reduced our annual cost of the facility primarily through lower undrawn pricing while also improving other terms and conditions. In a time of rising borrowing costs and tightening credit terms, our financial strength, strong operating performance and consistent fiscal discipline still enable us to obtain very favorable terms. You can see all the details in our 10-Q.  Similarly, during the second quarter, we issued a new 4-year cat bond, providing uninterrupted coverage upon the expiration of our prior cat bonds. The new bond, Long Point Re IV Ltd increases the amount of coverage available to $575 million. The recently expired cat bonds had provided $500 million worth of coverage. Specific terms are shown on Page 20 of the webcast presentation, and we're very pleased with the results.  Here again, our disciplined underwriting and consistent outperformance in the property line enabled us to increase our coverage and attain a reasonable rate online at a time when some parts of the market are finding reinsurance capacity harder to come by.  Also on Page 20 of the webcast presentation, you'll find a summary of our July 1 reinsurance renewals. The structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the expiring program. And while as expected, we did see some price increase. It was in line with the price increases we're obtaining on the direct property premiums we're writing. So there's no adverse impact on margins.  It's also worth noting that we increased the coverage under our Northeast property treaty by $150 million to $750 million, part of $850 million, above the same $2.25 billion attachment point.  So to sum it up, we had an excellent quarter with double-digit premium growth in all 3 segments, solid underwriting profitability and an improved outlook for fixed income NII, all of which bodes well for our future returns.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance continues to have a strong 2022 with another terrific quarter in terms of both financial results and execution in the marketplace. Second quarter segment income was $666 million, up about 4% from the prior year quarter driven by higher net favorable prior year reserve development and higher underlying underwriting income.  The quarter's very strong underlying combined ratio of 92.4% was about 1 point better than the second quarter of 2021 driven by improvement in the expense ratio resulting from the combination of the leverage from higher earned premiums and the benefits of our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. The underlying loss ratio was about flat to the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher earned pricing as well as elevated property loss activity in the current quarter.  Net written premiums were up in all domestic markets and lines of business, reaching $4.4 billion for an increase of 10%. Premiums benefited from strong renewal premium change and retention, both of which were once again historically high.  Turning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change of 10.3% was once again exceptionally strong. RPC includes renewal rate change of 4.9%, which was up 0.5 points from the first quarter and exposure growth of almost 6%. Retention was very strong at 86%. New business premium was about $500 million for the quarter.  We're pleased with these production results and our strong execution in the marketplace. Given our high-quality book as well as several years of segmented rate increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're thrilled to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. The rate gains we achieved in the quarter reflect deliberate execution given the significant improvements in profitability across the portfolio while continuing the price for the persisting headwinds and uncertainty in the current environment.  As always, we will continue to execute our granular pricing, careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sub-limits and exclusions to achieve profitable growth. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was strong at over 9% while retention of 83% was up 3 points from the prior year quarter.  New business was up 8% from the prior year quarter driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In addition to contributing to growth, the new BOP product is also contributing to improved margins in this business through industry-leading segmentation. Overall for Select, we're pleased with the improvement in profitability levels as well as the continued momentum in new business growth.  In Middle Market, renewal premium change remained very strong at over 10% while retention remained historically high at 88%. Underneath the RPC of 10%, renewal rate change of 4.8% was up 0.5 point from the first quarter while exposure growth was nearly 6%.  To sum up, Business Insurance had a terrific first half of the year. We continued to deliver strong results while investing in capabilities to enhance our data and analytics leadership, digitize the commercial transaction and develop sophisticated and relevant products to drive profitable growth for the future.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty had a terrific quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $228 million, up 22% from the prior year quarter driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development and higher underlying underwriting income. The underlying combined ratio was an excellent 82.2%, an improvement of 1.2 points from the prior year quarter.  Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew a very strong 13% in the quarter to a record high with contributions from all our businesses. Domestic Surety posted exceptional 24% growth in the quarter driven by larger average bond premiums.  In domestic Management Liability, we are pleased that we drove a 2-point improvement in retention while renewal premium change of 8.8% remains strong following 6 straight double-digit quarters. We're also pleased that we increased new business 16% from the prior year quarter.  So both top and bottom-line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, reflecting excellent execution across our business and the value of our market-leading products and services to our customers and distribution partners.  And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Personal Insurance reported a combined ratio of 111%. While it's not unusual for us to generate an underwriting loss in the second quarter, it typically has the highest weather-related loss activity, this quarter's results were also impacted by the inflationary pressure that we and the industry have been experiencing for the past few quarters.  In total, the combined ratio increased 11.5 points compared to the prior year quarter and included a higher underlying combined ratio, higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior year reserve development. The 5-point increase in the underlying combined ratio reflects elevated loss severity in both automobile and homeowners and other, and in comparison to a low level of automobile losses in the prior year quarter.  Catastrophe losses were nearly 5 points higher than in the prior year quarter but not out of line with our assumption for second quarter catastrophes. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 12% driven by higher renewal premium changes in both domestic automobile and Homeowners & Other.  In automobile, the second quarter combined ratio was 104.3% and the underlying combined ratio was 101.8%, an increase of about 10 points relative to the prior year quarter. The increase reflects elevated vehicle replacement and repair costs. To a lesser extent, the increase is also a result of a comparison to a prior year quarter that still reflected lower loss -- lower claim frequency related to the pandemic. Our primary response to the environmental challenge of inflation is higher pricing. We are pleased with our actions to increase rates over the past few quarters and remain confident in our ability to achieve further increases. As we have indicated in past quarters, it will take some time for rate actions to fully earn into our results.  In Homeowners and Other, the second quarter combined ratio was 118% and included 29 points of catastrophes primarily from severe wind and hail events across several regions in the U.S. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 90.3%, comparable to the prior year quarter. We continue to experience loss severity related to a -- higher loss severity related to a combination of labor and material price increases, but that was largely offset by various items, including a comparison to a prior year quarter that included elevated non-weather losses as well as the current quarter benefits of earned pricing.  Turning to quarterly production. We continue to make excellent progress in achieving pricing increases. For domestic automobile, renewal premium change was 6.3%, up a full 3 points from the first quarter of 2022. We continue to increase renewal premium changes and expect RPC to reach double digits by the fourth quarter.  For domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change increased about 1.5 points from the first quarter to a record high of 13.5%. The increase in renewal premium change was from both higher insured values and increased rate. While our primary focus is on improving profitability, we're not distracted from continuing to invest in capabilities to sustain our success. For example, in the quarter, we introduced new artificial intelligence-enabled aerial imagery to enhance our property underwriting and risk selection while simplifying the quoting process for agency customers. This is just one example of how we continue to advance our sophistication and risk expertise as part of our innovation agenda.  With our focus on performing -- on both performing and transforming, we remain confident in our ability to improve profitability over time while continuing to build the business for the future.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you, and we are ready to open up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Michael Phillips from Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: I guess first question on auto, for personal auto. It feels like your rate activity has been a little bit later to take hold than peers and maybe still a little bit below loss trend. I just wanted to see if you agree with that. And then if so, kind of 2-part question of that. Just how do you view your profitability of the current book in auto? You're taking on some good new business there. So how is the profitability of the current book?  And then I guess just -- we've seen some actions from others in prior period development. And I guess just confidence that that's not going to be the case for you guys.\nMichael Klein: Sure. So I'll take the rate activity question. This is Michael Klein, and then Dan will probably talk about prior period development.  So Michael, I think we've talked about rate pretty much every quarter for the last 3 or 4. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're pleased with our progress. There are certainly some peers who have reported bigger headline rate numbers than we have. Although when we look at the overall marketplace and compare our rate filing activity and our rate levels -- and our rate increase levels with the broader marketplace, we're largely in line with the overall industry, if not a little bit ahead of the industry average.  Again, there's a couple of peers in particular that have talked about bigger headline numbers than we have. But in aggregate, we continue to be very active in the -- on the rate filing front, continue to incorporate new data into our indications. And as I mentioned, our outlook is we're confident in our ability to continue to increase pricing to the point where we think RPC for personal auto will exceed double digits or get into double digits in the fourth quarter.  So we continue to drive to improve profitability and make progress. And in terms of the new business, the 318 this quarter is up about 6% from the prior year quarter. More of that increase is from RPC now than it was a quarter before. And as you look at the PIF growth, it is starting to decelerate responding to the rate we're putting into the marketplace. So that's sort of the trajectory we're on. And again, the priority is to continue to drive pricing to improve profitability.  Now I'll turn it over to Dan to talk about PYD.\nDaniel Frey: Mike, it's Dan. So on the PYD question, I guess I'd bring you back to accident years '20 and '21 when we were talking about seeing favorability largely frequency driven but we are seeing favorability in personal auto. We are seeing favorability in commercial auto. We're seeing favorability in non-COVID claims in the workers' comp line. And we said at the time that we were recognizing some of that favorability in our results, but that there was also uncertainty in the environment.  And one of the things we talked about was uncertainty around what the ultimate severity of some of those claims might be. And in PI, we talked specifically about the fact that claims were happening at higher speeds and we were seeing some more severity.  And so we said pretty consistently in 2020 and in 2021 that we were being cautious in our reserving in order to make sure that we were allowing for the additional level of uncertainty that we felt was possible. And so at least so far, the way things are playing out seems to bear that out.\nMichael Klein: Yes. And Michael, this is Michael Klein again. I just want to add one other comment on the pricing conversation, which is we get a lot of conversation about the headline rate number that people are getting today. It's also important, and we've talked about this in the past, to look back at the history. And our renewal premium change in personal auto never went negative. And we didn't talk about that as much back then when some other carriers had renewal premium change that was negative. So the starting point matters, I guess, is the point that I would add. Thanks for the question.\nMichael Phillips: Yes. Okay. Yes. Perfect. That's very helpful. Second, switching gears -- completely switching gears then on comp. Has there been any change in mix of the type of claims you're seeing recently in comp, either mix by permanent versus temporary or partial sources so that kind of mix change that might in fact impact the closure rates of your claims either faster or slower the past year?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Michael, this is Greg. We haven't seen any real material mix change. Of course, as we went through the pandemic, we had a certain mix of claims. And so as you normalize that, if we look at our claim mix today to pre-pandemic, there isn't any real material change.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Scott: I was hoping you could just comment on just the overall outlook for business insurance margins and for further underwriting margin improvement. Certainly, we can look at your renewal rate changes and then we can think about loss costs, which I think you've got to be getting impacted at least some by the CPI inflation that we're seeing. But there's obviously parts that aren't quantifiable for us and we'd just be interested in understanding some of those pieces and how you see it unfolding.\nAlan Schnitzer: Alex, it's Alan. Let me start and then I'll turn it over to Greg. And let me just start with -- we're starting from a pretty good place. The underlying loss ratio and the overall underlying combined in BI is starting at a very good place. And we don't give outlook on those measures. But let me just make a broad comment, which is if you look at where our overall pricing is today, we would say all other things being equal, it's ahead of loss trend.  And so as that earns in, we would expect some improvement from there. Let me just caveat that with all things are never the same. And so this quarter, for example, we're calling out some elevated level of property loss activity. And it was just a couple of quarters ago when we were calling out favorable property loss activity.  So that kind of stuff is always going to be a little episodic. But when we look at the factors that we would consider to be run rate for lack of a better word, and we look at where pricing is and where we think loss trend is, we think the outlook, again, from a pretty good place is positive.\nAlexander Scott: And for my follow-up question, I think you mentioned higher invest -- sorry, higher insured values when you're talking about the personal lines business. But I'd just be interested on the business insurance side of things. The growth is coming in pretty nicely there as well. We can see the exposure units going up. I mean how impactful are sort of the audits around the insured values for the growth? And how much do you expect that to be helping the top line here?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes. Alex, this is Greg. Yes, clearly, our underwriters are looking at terms and conditions and insured values in this environment and constantly trying to get the right insurance to value on the exposure to the right both new business and renewal. And so that's been an active lever very similar to the personal insurance side. That's more on the transactional side.  And on the flow side of Select, we do have an inflationary protection guard that we're actively managing to make sure that, that keeps up with the inflation environment. So very much an active management lever for us on the business insurance side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: The first question I had is around what the market seems to be projecting or anticipating a recession either later this year or next. And I was wondering if you could talk about how you might think business insurance and domestic bond and specialty might perform and where the areas of pressure might be if there is indeed a recession?  And then related to that, I'm just curious as you sort of strategize how you might change your approach to management of the company if this were to come to pass.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks for the question. And let me just make a couple of general comments and feel free to follow up if I don't scratch the edge. But in a recession, we're going to do what we do. We serve our customers. We serve our distribution partners. We take care of our communities. We take care of our employees. And so from that perspective, it's business as usual for us.  Now we ensure the output of the economy. So we'd expect some impact to the top line, and that's going to impact everybody. But we're pretty well positioned. The work we've done to improve productivity and efficiency positions us well. And we've got the resources and financial strength continue to make investments in our business without interruption.  In terms of credit sensitivity, as I shared in my prepared remarks, the investment portfolio is very high-quality -- high credit quality, as is our surety business. So I guess the only other point I would make in a recession again, you'd expect some maybe pressure on the top line. But if history is any guide, at least in the commercial businesses, maybe you get some relief on loss trend.  So we run the business for the long term. We say that all the time. So there's really not a lot we need to do differently. And you can just look and see how we perform through various economic cycles over the years, including recession, financial crisis, et cetera. We think we're very well positioned and we'll do just fine.\nCharles Peters: Got it. Well, Dan, in your comments regarding investment income, you talked about the nonfixed income piece. And you mentioned the fact that the market was down, the S&P is down 21% year-to-date. Is it conceivable that the actual marks in this area of your portfolio might turn negative in the third and fourth quarter, considering the dramatic performance of the market? Or I guess, in a broader sense, versus saying it's just going to be worse, can you just give us some sort of context of what you think it might look like in the second half of this year?\nDaniel Frey: Yes. I think it's very hard to predict. And we've got a portfolio that is individually underwritten. And so that's why we say it's not going to be perfectly correlated. But directionally, if you see weakness in the equity markets, we'd expect to see at least some slowdown in the level of strength. We have, although rarely, seen negative returns in the alternative portfolio in times of extreme disruption like we did in the first or second quarter of 2020 at the onset of COVID.  But over a pretty short period of time when the markets came back, we got all that back and then some. So we're not really in a position to give a forecast of whether we expect alternative NII to be less robust than it has or how low it might go. But again, we're doing this for the long term. And if you look at our results over a long term, even in really significant downturn for the broader markets, we've done probably better than most.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, I'm looking to get color on the BI margin. You guys called out higher earned pricing. You also called out elevated property losses. Could I get the impact of both of those on the current quarter?\nDaniel Frey: Yes. Elyse, it's Dan. So directionally, without going down to a very fine level of reconciliation, we've been talking about in recent quarters, the benefit of earned pricing being somewhere around 1 point. That's not going to change all that quickly. As written premium -- as written price over the last few quarters came down, you'd expect the earned basis to come down, but that takes time to come down.  So that's still sort of the ballpark. And with the margins relatively stable from a year ago, that would sort of imply that the property piece going the other way relative to what we expected was about 1 point.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my second question. You guys had talked about higher inflation on last quarter's call and said that inflation within Business Insurance was probably in the range of 5.5% to 6%. Did you guys see any movements in your loss trend assumptions in the second quarter?\nAlan Schnitzer: No, Elyse, we didn't. We -- I'll say two things. One, the loss activity you saw in the quarter was generally consistent with that. But two, loss trend is something we evaluate over a long period of time. So not typically -- doesn't typically gyrate around in a particular quarter. But I think to be responsive to your question, the loss activity we saw was consistent with what we expected.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous.\nRyan Tunis: Just in BI, how should we interpret the acceleration of written rate from 43 to 49?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Ryan, it's Greg. Yes, I'll give you a little bit of color from the prior quarter. It was broadly based across many lines led by auto, property and our primary GL lines. And our underwriters look at every account that come up for the renewal in that quarter. And they're focused on making sure that they've got the right price to risk, terms and conditions just to get the right rate adequacy.  So in terms of -- on one hand, we feel great about that increase in pricing and returns are in a much better place based on the industry and our pricing over the past few years. But those headwinds that we've talked about, inflation and weather, et cetera, are still out there. So it's a headline number at an aggregate level. Our underwriters are going to continue to be focused on making sure that the accounts that come up renewal have the rate adequacy on it. And that -- hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color for the quarter.\nRyan Tunis: And then for Michael, just curious from a frequency perspective, what are you observing, I guess? It's the summer, gas prices are lower. There's been some discussion of that impacting frequency trends. But just curious sort of like how are you thinking about frequency? What are you seeing right now?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Ryan. Thanks for the question. I would say two things. One, specific to your question on gas prices, and I think we talked about this a little bit last quarter, we don't see huge sensitivity in our miles driven data to gas prices. We actually think employment has a bigger impact on miles driven than gas prices do. So really, the impact of the price upswing we saw 2, 3 months ago and the slight relief we've seen over the last month or so isn't really driving change in driving behavior based on the data we're observing.  And then in terms of frequency, again, I think two comments are important about this quarter. One, second quarter of last year still showed favorable frequency because driving levels were still depressed. And so they'll return towards pre-pandemic normal is a bad guide quarter -- or year-over-year. But in terms of driving behavior and claim frequency, we would say it remains in that space of approaching pre-pandemic normal levels.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW.\nMeyer Shields: I guess first question overall. I was hoping you could take us through how you're thinking about medical inflation potentially lagging the really high overall inflation that we've seen broadly and how that impacts loss trend selection?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Meyer, a couple of comments on medical inflation. So given that it impacts long-term lines like workers' comp and GL, you can imagine when we watch it very closely. And two, as we've shared before, we take a very cautious approach to reserving those long-term lines.  Having said that, while medical inflation certainly isn't immune from the broader inflationary environment, the recent trends on the whole continue to be, I'd say, relatively benign. The other thing is you got to make a distinction between medical inflation and the types of inflation that impact loss costs. So workers' comp and GL, for example, are driven by a subset of medical costs. We're treating workplace injuries. We're treating accidents. We're not treating chronic diseases. And those components of medical inflation that impact workers' cost -- workers' comp and GL are increasing at lower than the headline medical CPI. Also in terms of workers' comp, for example, we've got fee schedules and other medical management practices that mitigate the types of inflation that could impact those loss costs. So there's a little bit of a narrative on medical inflation. Hopefully, that's responsible.\nMeyer Shields: No, that is very helpful. And then a quick question for Michael. Within -- specifically on the home side, other than actual rate changes, how do average premiums per policy respond to rising replacement costs?\nMichael Klein: Yes, Meyer. So in the home, really, RPC is a combination, right, of operate and those insured values. And so in terms of how they respond, that renewal premium change number that we share with you is a blend of the rate change we're getting on renewals and the impact of increased value.  And I guess just one step deeper into the process. We evaluate replacement cost data on a regular basis and typically update our annual inflation -- our annual increased limit factors, what we call AIL on an annual basis. In this environment, we're actually looking at it more frequently and have actually updated it a second time this year, which is part of why you're seeing that RPC in home continue to rise. And that's why I mentioned in my prepared remarks that the increase in RPC in home is a combination of increased rate and increased limit.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. So that sounds like it's broadly margin neutral, if I'm understanding it correctly.\nMichael Klein: What I would say is both the rate and the increased limit are responsive to the inflation that we're seeing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Just first, one quick clarification. Dan, on the business insurance kind of non-cat weather losses in the quarter, you kind of said about 1 point better than last quarter. I think last second quarter, you said it was 150 basis points below trend. Would that imply that this quarter was maybe 50 basis points below typical second quarter?\nDaniel Frey: No. Brian, if we think about the non-cat property losses that are in underlying last year, we said the -- as you pointed out, last year we said they're about 1.5 points better than what we would have expected in the second quarter. This year, what we actually said that it's about 1 point worse than what we would have expected.  So there was actually a bigger swing in the underlying property losses, I think, north of 2 points. And then there's -- as there are frequently in other quarters, a number of other things, none of which were individually big, think mix, think segmentation that actually benefited the loss ratio in the quarter. And that got us back down to the neutral number.\nBrian Meredith: Got you. That makes sense. And then just one other just quick one. Workers' compensated insurance continue to see a nice improvement in premium growth there. Is that all just exposure growth that you're seeing at this point?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Brian, it's Greg. Yes. For the most part, that is absolutely some of the strong exposure growth. You can certainly relate to the increases in payrolls across the economy. So that's one of the key drivers of that in that line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Shanker from Bank of America.\nJoshua Shanker: I was looking at the 10-K, and you guys have duly warned us about the variable investment income in the back half of 2022. Obviously, the markets were not so strong in the first quarter this year. I would have thought that the 2Q results would have been weaker. And when I look at you saying, hey, the back half of the year be careful, is there more than a 3-month lag when we think about these things? Do we have any reason to think that 4Q should be particularly weak at this point in time?\nDaniel Frey: No, Josh, it's Dan. I don't think there's any change to our sort of historical commentary. We say generally, things are on about a 1-quarter lag. Second quarter was pretty strong from an alternative, if you consider it in the context of the broader market. But again, we're not necessarily going to follow that in lockstep. We've got individual investments within the quarter.  Real estate did pretty well. We had some energy holdings that did pretty well. We had some transportation holdings that did pretty well. So it's going to be a function of what's actually inside of our portfolio. And that's really what you're seeing as opposed to any change in the live pattern.\nJoshua Shanker: All right. And then the renewal premium change is obviously a lagging indicator of what you're doing on rates. When you look at the -- I guess for Michael. When you look at the auto book or maybe even auto and the home book and you know what kind of rates you were getting, when do you hope that you are getting rates in excess or at least matching the loss trend? And I guess when do you think that a renewal rate trend will sort of be matching that on the net premium earned line?\nMichael Klein: Yes. Great question, Josh, and a really hard one to answer in this environment. I mean I think -- there's one conversation we could have around what those numbers are relative to a relatively long-term view of trend. Unfortunately, the environment that we're in and -- you can pick your statistic. I mean it's really a pretty unprecedented environment in terms of loss cost inflation in the personal lines of business. You can look at body work CPI, I think, is the highest it's been since 1980 in low double digits. You can look at shingles prices, lumber prices. The Manheim Used Vehicle Index right, was up 30-plus percent last year and it stayed there.  So it's really hard to put a point on when the rate will exceed loss trend until we fully understand how long this elevated inflation is going to last. And so from that standpoint, that's why our focus really isn't on picking that point. Our focus is on continuing to incorporate the latest data into our pricing and underwriting processes, and continuing to raise rate as we see that evidence of further need.  To your point, and it's a good one, the 6.3 RPC as an example that we reported in auto is the written impact of the rate we've taken essentially over the last 3 or 4 quarters as it hits renewals. And so one important point to make is even if we didn't file for any additional rate, which we are, that number would rise next quarter because we haven't yet seen the full written impact of the rate that we've already gotten filed and approved.  But again, importantly we've gotten -- that rate already in the pipeline that will drive that number higher. And we are continuing to seek additional increases, which will continue to drive that number higher and, again, drive it into the double digits by the fourth quarter of this year, speaking specifically to auto.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: I'm just trying to reconcile your deteriorating underlying loss ratios in both BI and PI on a sequential basis in your premium growth achievement. I mean, is the idea that you're happy with your risk-adjusted returns, so you don't feel like you need to withdraw underwriting capacity just yet? I guess I'm just trying to figure out if you're trying to be more discerning where you're growing from here, even if it's just pockets of your business.\nDaniel Frey: So Tracy, it's Dan. I'll start. And I think we've done this before. But again, I think there's a reason that we don't look at combined ratio on a sequential basis. And part of that is what you see in the second quarter in particular because whether it's cat losses or underlying property, we expect more activity in the second quarter than the rest of the quarters of the year.  To go back to the comments that Alan was making and that Greg made, if we look at where the underlying combined ratios are and the returns are coming out of 2021, in which we had north of a 13.5% core ROE in the first half of the year this year, that's 12.4% through the first 6 months of the year. We feel like the business as a whole is in a pretty good place. We've got a balanced portfolio. Some parts of the portfolio are going to be stronger than others at certain times. But we're managing the business for the long term. And we're not thinking about withdrawing capacity at this point. We've got plenty of capital. And we think there's plenty of good business in the marketplace to write that's going to serve us well in the long term.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. Could you maybe unpack your favorable prior development in specifically within CMP? Was that liability or nonliability? And the reason I'm asking is because you experienced unfavorable development in GL. And I noticed the releases from CMP came from recent accident years, which would make more sense for short tail lines.\nDaniel Frey: Yes. It's not a big number, Tracy. I'm just not going to break it down any further than that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Motemaden from Evercore.\nDavid Motemaden: Just a question for Michael on personal auto. Could you talk a little bit about how you're handling closing claims quickly and just claims resolutions? I would think that your book has more preferred business and newer cars that are more complex to repair, which -- it sounds like you guys feel like you're on top of that potential issue. But maybe you could just talk about how you're approaching closing claims in a timely fashion on the auto book?\nMichael Klein: Sure, David. So I would say yes, we're on top of it. Our claim team is top-notch. They're terrifically talented and capable. And we've got great discipline and process inside the claims organization. They're really just terrific partners in support of the business. That said, we're not immune from the environmental pressures that you read about and you've seen and heard others talk about. So while we are on top of things and while the way you described our portfolio makes sense, it is taking longer to get parts. It is taking longer to get a time slot in a body shop. That is putting pressure on the length of time it takes to make repair. That is putting pressure on average rental days for nondrivable repairs.  We're doing a lot in really all we can to work with customers to help manage that. One example is being in dialogue with the customer and ensuring, for example, that if their vehicle is drivable, that they wait to take until the shop until we and they have verified the parts of the labor are available. So doing a lot of things to try to manage that. But the length of time to repair on average is extending.  And it's really -- that's one element of the process. Salvage and subrogation takes longer these days for total vehicle availability remains a challenge. I mean those -- we're faced with all those challenges. But I think our claim organization is doing a terrific job of managing and navigating those.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. And then just a question for Dan. I think you had mentioned that the expense ratio getting down to 29% for the full year, a little bit ahead of schedule. Should we be thinking about a lower expense ratio than 29% as we think about '23 or '24? Or are we -- do you feel like 29% is a good level to operate at going forward?\nDaniel Frey: Yes, David, we're not going to give '23 or '24 outlook here. I'd just say a couple of years ago, we were talking about being pretty comfortable with the 30. And then a quarter or 2 ago, we were talking about being more comfortable with the 29.5. We're not really setting a target expense ratio. We're managing the business as a whole to overall combined ratio and returns. We're making all the investments that we want to make. What we find is that we've been able to do that inside the still improving expense ratio. I think last quarter, we said we might get down to 29 sometime in the next year or 2 -- another quarter of success. It looks like we'll probably be there this year. I'm not really inclined to give an outlook beyond that.\nOperator: And we have time for just one more question coming from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: I guess first question for Michael around the loss trends in personal auto. I heard you talk a lot about physical damage. Are you also seeing a bodily injury component there? Because it's something that we've certainly heard from a lot of the other auto insurers as of late. So maybe you could quantify or qualify that?\nMichael Klein: Yes. Yaron, thanks for the question, and I'll qualify it probably and not quantify it. But similar to the comment I made last quarter, we haven't spiked out bodily injury loss trend as a driver in the sort of year-over-year comparisons and relative to expectation. Not because it hasn't been elevated and not because we haven't seen elevated bodily injury loss trend. But -- and in particular, we've seen elevated inflation in bodily injury. There's been a little bit of favorability in bodily injury frequency, offsetting some of that severity. And we had a pretty healthy assumption around what the bodily injury loss trend was going to be. And so it just hasn't jumped out as a delta relative to our expectation. But that doesn't mean we don't see pressure. It doesn't mean we're not observing it. It just means it's not a significant difference from what we had anticipated.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. And then -- and this is probably a broader question maybe for Greg or for Alan. You guys are essentially the insurer of the U.S. economy, if you will. And with all this talk about a potential recession, fears of recession, is there any indicator that you're seeing in your conversations with clients today that would lead you to see that actually materializing? And if so, are there specific sectors or industries that you're seeing maybe pressure emerging in?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yaron, I'd say not yet. The business underlying fundamentals we're seeing from our customers are strong. I think the economic -- the macroeconomic data you see confirms that as the time continues to increase interest rates in an effort to bring down demand, I think we're all reading those tea leaves and imagining it's coming. But we're not seeing it in our data, not any significant degree.\nOperator: I will turn the call back over to Abbe for closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much.

Welcome to the first quarter results teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 19, 2022. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.  Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2022 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning.

There's a lot of terrific background and other content in this document. I would encourage you to take a look at it, whether you're familiar with Travelers or new to our story.  And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to report excellent results this morning. But before we dive into the quarter, I want to acknowledge the geopolitical crisis and humanitarian nightmare unfolding in Ukraine. Our thoughts and prayers are with those under attack, the millions of refugees seeking life\u2019s most basic necessities and the loved ones of those who have lost their lives. Turning now to our results. We're off to a terrific start for the year with an excellent bottom line results, growth in all 3 segments, strong and improved profitability in our commercial business segments, progress addressing the environmental headwinds facing the personal insurance industry and another quarter of progress on a number of important strategic initiatives. Core income for the quarter was $1 billion or $4.22 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 15.5%. These results were driven by net earned premiums of $8 billion, up 9% over the prior year quarter and an excellent combined ratio of 91.3%. We're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying results in our commercial businesses. Looking at the 2 commercial segments together. The combined BI, BSI underlying combined ratio was 90.2% for the quarter, an improvement of nearly 2 points from the prior year quarter. Underwriting results in Personal Insurance were impacted by auto loss frequency returning to more normal levels as miles driven has increased as well as elevated severity in auto and property. Against this challenging backdrop of environmental headwinds, PI results for the quarter were nonetheless solid, with a 95.3% all-in combined ratio. Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $539 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting reliable results from our fixed income portfolio, and strong returns from our nonfixed income portfolio. As you'll hear from Dan shortly, the recent rise in interest rates positively impacts our outlook for fixed income NII. Our excellent operating results, together with our solid balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 11% over the past year, and that's after making important investments in our business and returning excess capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $773 million of excess capital to our shareholders, including nearly $560 million of share repurchases. In light of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a 6% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.93 per share, marking 18 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 9% over that period. Turning to the top line. Thanks to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners. We grew net written premiums by 11% this quarter to a record $8.4 billion. Each of our 3 segments made strong contributions.  In Business Insurance, renewal premium change was 9.1%, remaining near all-time highs. At the same time, retention of 87% was an all-time high. We have a very high-quality book of business and keeping it as a priority. Also as we've shared previously, strong retentions are a sign of a rational and stable pricing market. Underneath the headline numbers, execution at a segmented level is excellent, with higher retentions of our best business and more rate in those segments that need it. New business levels were also strong, up about 17% over the prior year quarter. All in, BI net written premiums grew 9%. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 22%, driven by strong production in both Management Liability and Surety. In Management Liability, renewal premium change was up 12% while retention remained high and new business was up 12%. In Surety, production was terrific with net written premiums up 29%. Notwithstanding some severity pressure from the inflationary environment, we're pleased to see continued written margin expansion in both of our commercial businesses, which, of course, will earn in over time. In Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12%. Renewal premium change -- renewal premium change increased in both auto and homeowners as we execute to improve margins. As we expected, retention in new business growth moderated a little bit in response. We'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Notwithstanding our terrific results and an economy that, in many respects, feels pretty good at the moment, there's a fair amount to pay attention to in terms of the macroeconomic outlook for the world in general and our industry in particular. There's a wide range of views on the outlook for economic growth and headline inflation is at a 40-year high. Geopolitical risk is at a decade high as war wages in Eastern Europe, tensions rise elsewhere, and the world nationalizes reversing a trend of globalization. Between the plaintiffs bar, regulatory uncertainty and weather severity, loss costs are as challenging as ever to predict. The global pandemic reminds us of the risk of unknown unknowns. And the one thing we know for sure is that the pace of technological change is accelerating. Travelers is built for this environment. For starters, a culture of unmatched underwriting and investment discipline positions us for nearly any environment. That's been the foundation of our success through the 2008 financial crisis, the most severe natural and man-made catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, a major inflection in liability loss cost trends, the pandemic and now the war in Ukraine. Through all the twist and turns foreseeable and otherwise, we've consistently delivered industry-leading returns at industry low volatility. We didn't exactly predict any of those events, but managing our business for long-term success by carefully balancing risk and reward on both sides of the balance sheet positioned us to successfully manage through all of them. In terms of the economic outlook, if the economy continues to grow, we'll benefit from higher insured exposures, as you've seen in our results over the past few quarters. If we head into a recession, we're very well positioned having made significant progress and improving productivity and efficiency in recent years. In terms of higher inflation, there are several things to keep in mind. First, with respect to our fixed income portfolio, we would expect to benefit from higher net investment income as higher inflation is typically accompanied by higher interest rates. Second, on the underwriting side, we have a favorable business mix. Our domestic commercial GL and workers comp lines account for about 1/4 of our premiums, both have an audit mechanism for retroactive premium adjustment. And as we discussed, higher exposures, particularly from wages and sales, contribute to improved margins. The short-tail personal insurance lines and commercial property account for almost half of our premiums. In short-tail lines, we can identify and price for the impact of inflation reasonably quickly, and the reserves on the balance sheet are significantly less exposed to changes in loss inflation. Finally, we take into account the inflationary environment and the related uncertainties when we establish our loss picks and set our balance sheet reserves. When assessing inflation, we're generally cautious, especially during periods of elevated uncertainty. We're also well positioned in terms of geopolitical risk. We're primarily U.S.-based with more than 95% of our premiums coming from North America. And we have a focused international footprint with strong partnerships that provide us with the ability to place our customers' business all over the world. Consequently, our business is, to a significant degree, insulated from the heightened geopolitical risk environment. With our leading franchise in the U.S., we have the pole position in the largest, most advanced and most stable economy in the world. Given the size of the U.S. economy, even a modest rate of growth, generates substantial growth in dollar terms and therefore, substantial growth opportunities for Travelers. With our footprint, we have opportunities to continue growing through geographies, products, classes of business and distribution partners that we've known and understood for decades. And given our concentration as a primary insurer in Middle Markets, there are meaningful barriers to entry. Importantly, within the largest insurance market in the world, our business also benefits from significant diversification. We offer 9 major lines of insurance to personal and commercial customers. Our portfolio is balanced across these lines of business and further diversified across regions by distribution partner and by class and customer size. In this business, the one constant is if the loss costs are going to change, what's important is having the ability to quickly identify and react to the changes, and we do. We have an advantage in terms of the quantity and quality of our data and the sophistication of our analytics. We spent decades fostering a culture that knows how to balance the art and science of underwriting. We have a strong orientation towards risk-adjusted returns, and we have an incredibly tight feedback loop among our underwriting, claim and actuarial disciplines. All of that contributed to our early recognition of social inflation, positioning us to respond early in terms of underwriting and claims handling strategies. We've been similarly forward leaning indeveloping underwriting and claims strategies to address weather severity. As we've discussed a few times, over the last 5 years, we've outperformed our market share in terms of cat losses. Another thing that's crystal clear is the rapid pace of change in the world. While the current conditions require us to be laser focused on the here and now, and we are, the dramatic pace of change, together with our scale, industry leadership, deep domain expertise and talent advantage presents us with the opportunity to lead in transforming the way business is done. We have a well-defined innovation strategy and have demonstrated success over the past half dozen years or so in innovating with desired outcomes, growth, industry-leading returns and industry low volatility. In short, we feel very well positioned for continued success no matter what environment comes our way. In the meantime, we're innovating on top of the foundation of excellence to transform our business to competitive advantages that are relevant, differentiating and difficult to replicate.  And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $1.04 billion, up from $699 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 15.5%. The increase in core income resulted primarily from a lower level of catastrophe losses, partially offset by a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development and strong but lower returns in our nonfixed income portfolio. Underlying underwriting income was strong in both periods. Our first quarter results include $160 million of pretax cat losses, much lower than last year's record high first quarter of $835 million pretax. Our after-tax underlying underwriting gain of $580 million was consistent with the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio of 91.2%. Improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were more than offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes. The first quarter expense ratio improved in all 3 segments, with the consolidated expense ratio of 29%, nearly a full point below last year's 29.9%. We continue to make significant investments in strategic initiatives, while the combination of a strategic focus on expense discipline and strong top line growth, delivered a lower expense ratio. As we indicated in our fourth quarter earnings call, there will inevitably be some variation in any given quarter. We're still planning for a full year expense ratio for 2022 of around 29.5%. And we're on a path towards a full year expense ratio of around 29% in the next year or 2. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $153 million pretax in the first quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $113 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp and also includes an environmental charge of $45 million. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $35 million was driven by better-than-expected results in the surety book. Personal Insurance experienced $5 million of net favorable PYD with modest activity in both auto and home. After-tax net investment income decreased by 9% from the prior year quarter to $539 million. Returns in our nonfixed income portfolio were strong, but as expected, were less favorable than we experienced in last year's quarter. Fixed maturity NII was higher than in the prior year quarter, as the benefit of higher invested assets more than offset the impact of lower fixed income yields. With the recent increase in interest rates, we are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities to approximately $440 million after tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $460 million in the third quarter and then to $480 million in the fourth quarter. Remember, only about 9% of the portfolio turns over each year, so the higher new money rates will take a while to fully impact run rate NII. Recall that results for our private equities, hedge funds and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a 1-quarter lag. While not perfectly correlated, our non-fixed income returns directionally follow the broader equity markets, which were generally down during the first quarter. Accordingly, we expect that to be reflected in our non-fixed income results next quarter.  Regarding reinsurance, as discussed during our fourth quarter results call, we renewed our underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty for 2022 and providing aggregate coverage of $225 million, part of $500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of $2 billion. Through March 31, we've accumulated $175 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter benefited from the favorable completion of an income tax audit for 2017 and 2018, which resulted in the release of $47 million of tax accruals related to those years. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.3 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. As interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, we moved from a net unrealized investment gain of $2.4 billion after tax at year-end to a net unrealized investment loss of $1.4 billion after tax at March 31. Remember, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on our statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.  Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $112.19 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end and up 11% from a year ago. We returned $773 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $559 million and dividends of $214 million. And as Alan mentioned earlier, our Board authorized a 6% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.93 per share.  Sticking with the topic of capital management, you're likely aware that Standard & Poor's has proposed changes to its capital adequacy model. Without final guidance and the actual proposed models from S&P, it would be premature to draw a conclusion as to the potential impact. What I can say is that, as always, we are most interested in our own view of the appropriate level of capital to ensure our financial resilience, As we have consistently demonstrated, including with our excellent results in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, our disciplined approach to risk selection, asset management, prudent reserving and thoughtful capital management come together to deliver profitable growth while ensuring that we have the financial strength to navigate even the most challenging of circumstances. While we believe it's important to remain very well capitalized and continued growth in the business will require higher levels of capital going forward, we will not maintain a level of capital beyond what we consider to be appropriate simply to obtain a certain rating level. Finally, as related to the hostilities in Ukraine, we don't have any direct exposure to Ukraine or the Russian Federation in our investment portfolio. And given the current scope of hostilities our insurance exposures in the impacted areas are not significant.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance is off to a terrific start in 2020 with an exceptionally strong first quarter. Segment income of $669 million was well over double the first quarter of 2021, driven by lower catastrophes and higher underlying underwriting income. The quarter's underlying combined ratio of 91.8% was almost 2 points better than the first quarter of 2021. The loss ratio improved by about 1 point, driven by higher earned pricing despite elevated severity, reflecting the inflationary environment. The expense ratio also improved by about 1 point, resulting from the combination of the leverage from higher earned premiums and the benefits of our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. Net written premiums increased 9% to an all-time quarterly high of $4.5 billion, benefiting from historically high renewal premium change and retention as well as an increase in new business. All lines of business were up over the prior year quarter. Turning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change of 9.1% included renewal rate change of 4.4% and at an all-time high for exposure growth of 4.9%, reflecting continued improvement in our customers' outlook for their businesses. Retention of 87% was also a record high. And finally, new business of $544 million was up 17% from the first quarter of last year, driven by our success with large accounts in Middle Market as well as our continued success with our innovative BOP 2.0 product in Select. We're pleased with these production results and our superior execution in the marketplace. Given our high-quality book as well as several years of meaningful rate increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're thrilled to have produced record retention levels. The rate gains we achieved in the quarter reflect deliberate execution given the significant improvements in profitability across the portfolio and through the benefit of higher exposures. Rate in workers' comp was a little more negative than we've seen over the past year, which is consistent with the strong profitability of the line. Having said that, overall renewal premium change in the workers' comp line was well in the positive territory, as exposure growth was at the highest level we've seen since 2006. Given the headwinds and uncertainty in the current environment, we will continue to execute our granular pricing, careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sublimits and exclusions to achieve profitable growth. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change was a strong 9%, while retention of 83% ticked up 1 point sequentially and was up 4 points from the prior year quarter. New business was up 16% from the prior year quarter, driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product, as I mentioned earlier. With improved margins in this business, we're pleased with the higher retention levels and continued momentum in new business growth. In Middle Market, renewal premium change remained strong at 8.8%, while retention reached an all-time high of 89%. New business was up 20% from the prior year quarter, driven predominantly by our success with large accounts, as I mentioned earlier. To sum up, Business Insurance had a great start to the year. We continue to improve the profitability of the book while investing in capabilities to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty started the year with a terrific quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $217 million up 58% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher underlying underwriting income, lower cat losses and a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 82.2% improved by 2 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. Also, the prior year quarter had about 1 point or so from some large cyber loss activity that didn't recur. Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew an outstanding 22% in the quarter with strong contributions from all our businesses. In domestic management liability, renewal premium change remained in double digits and improved by a little more than 1 point from the fourth quarter. Retention remains strong, despite the impact of our ongoing strategy to nonrenewed cyber accounts that do not meet our minimum cybersecurity protocols, including multifactor authentication. That change in our underwriting is having a meaningfully favorable impact on cyber claim frequency. We expect to complete the execution of this strategy across our renewal portfolio by the end of the second quarter. Notably, domestic management liability new business increased 12% from the prior year quarter. We were also pleased with the strong production this quarter from our domestic surety and international businesses. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, reflecting both excellent execution across our business and the value of our market-leading products and services to our customers and distribution partners.  And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Personal Insurance began 2022 with solid profitability in the context of an ongoing challenging environment. First quarter segment income was $225 million, down $89 million from the prior year quarter, as lower underlying underwriting margins and lower favorable prior year reserve development were partially offset by lower catastrophes. The total combined ratio was 95.3% for the first quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 92.8%, which was 7.4 points higher than the prior year quarter. This increase was driven by higher losses in both automobile and homeowners, which I will discuss in further detail in a moment. Partly offsetting this increase was a reduction in our underwriting expense ratio, which continues to reflect the benefit from higher earned premiums. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 12% and included higher renewal premium changes in both automobile and homeowners. In automobile, the first quarter combined ratio was 99.3%, an increase of 17.5 points compared to a prior year quarter that reflected low loss activity due to the pandemic. In the current year quarter, automobile loss levels increased due to a combination of coin frequency returning to more normal levels and higher loss severity as vehicle and replacement and repair costs remained elevated. During the first quarter, we increased rates in 23 states in response at an average rate of approximately 7%. Rate actions in additional states are scheduled to take effect in the coming months and quarters. As we indicated last quarter, although it will take time for these rate actions to earn into our results, we remain confident we're on track to address the near-term profit challenges. In Homeowners & Other, the first quarter combined ratio improved by 8 points from the prior year quarter to 91.2%, primarily driven by 17 points of lower catastrophes. As Dan mentioned, the prior year quarter had elevated catastrophe losses from winter storms and freeze events. Results for last year's first quarter also included higher net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9%, was 3 points higher than the prior year quarter, as we continued to see higher severity related to a combination of labor and material price increases. We will continue to seek increased pricing and response. As a reminder, for Homeowners, we expect the upcoming second quarter to be the seasonally highest quarter for weather-related loss levels.  Turning to production. We were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter in both Automobile and Homeowners. For domestic Automobile, retention was strong, and as we expected, down slightly to 84% as renewal premium change increased by about 2 points from the prior quarter to 3.1%. We expect renewal premium changes will continue to accelerate in each of the next 3 quarters and approach double digits by the end of the year. In domestic Homeowners and Other, retention was 84% and renewal premium change was 12.3%. The increase in RPC was primarily due to increased insured values in response to the inflationary environment.  Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a minute to address the important issue of increasing motor vehicle fatalities. More than 46,000 people lost their lives on U.S. roads in 2021, the highest total in more than 30 years, a grim reminder of the human cost of the increasing frequency and severity of auto accidents. Most research points to higher speeds and increased distraction as the most prominent drivers of the rise in fatalities. Recent data published by Cambridge Mobile Telematics, the partner that helps power our IntelliDrive program, showed that phone-related distractions in February of this year increased to the highest level they have ever recorded. Our own IntelliDrive data are aligned with this result. Further, the most recent addition of the Travelers risk index continues to show evidence of higher levels of distracted driving among those surveyed. In light of these observations and given April is distracted driving awareness month, I wanted to highlight a couple of ways Travelers is working to make a difference. In partnership with the Travelers Institute, we continue to support our Every Second Matters initiative, which empowers drivers, passengers, cyclists and pedestrians to speak up set positive examples and play an active role in changing roadway behaviors to help prevent injuries and save lives. Additionally, the inclusion of distraction as a rating variable in our IntelliDrive offering shows some promise in terms of changing behavior. We've seen a reduction in distracted driving events for drivers enrolled since introducing this variable. Of course, we all play a role in keeping our roads as safe as possible. These are just a couple of examples of how we're raising awareness and trying to make a difference. Before I turn the call back over to Abbe, I'd like to welcome the Trove team to Travelers. We were pleased to be able to acquire technology assets and hire a team of talented people from Trove earlier this year. We look forward to applying their expertise and capabilities to meet our customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael. And operator, we are ready to open up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips : Alan, I guess just first high-level question for you, just about the cycle. It's obviously a different cycle just in terms of its longevity for a number of reasons. But we're pretty clearly at the tail end of that. And I think we're at the tail of end that at a time when there's pretty specific nuances that could possibly make somebody concerned that loss trends accelerate faster than they otherwise would at the tail end of a cycle. Things you mentioned in your opening comments, demand surge, voluntary policy, demand, demographic shifts, inflation, the list goes going on, and it seems to be added to on a daily basis. I guess, so -- the question we get, and I know you've heard this question before is, will those things that are kind of unique to the current situation make for pricing to kind of tick back up again, if you will? And it's not, I guess, for your book of business is different. So maybe you can talk to -- are you concerned about that? Are you surprised by that? Any concerns at all that BI pricing is indeed continuing to decelerate at the time when there's a lot of risk out there for low stress?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Thanks for the question. And let me paint a picture for you. So the pricing environment, despite what you're focused on, which I suspect is the right number, the pricing environment is actually quite strong. And you see that in BI and BSI with overall pricing near record levels, for earned and written continued debt -- our earned and written continues to exceed trends. Our margins on a written basis are expanding. When we look at the breadth of pricing gains, very good. The significant majority of our accounts continue to get positive rate And you look at retentions at near all-time high is that -- I mean, that tells you that the overall market is pretty stable. And what we're doing is deliver, right? That's -- you look at that retention and that tells you what we're doing is deliver. If we weren't able to achieve what we wanted to achieve, retention would be lower. You got to add to that, the pretty good progress we've made over -- actually, at this point, many years of very, very strong pricing gains. So you've got improving margins. And so that's sort of where we are right now. So having said that, as you point out, there are some clouds out there that we are very well aware of, I think the industry is very well aware of them. And as we price the marginal product, we're looking at what the expiring rate is, we're looking at what loss trend is, we're looking at what other factors that impact margins, and then we're putting a price on the product. And so we're not troubled by anything in this production environment that you see or the outlook, frankly.\nMichael Phillips : Okay. Appreciate that. Maybe a little bit more drill down question for my second one, and possibly for Michael. On personal auto, a lot of attention obviously on severity for physical damage side, but medical inflation has been kind of one of the best performers in the CPI index and yet there's concerns that it might tick up, but it hasn't yet. And I think BI liability is trending pretty high. Can you talk about that disconnect? And what you're seeing in your BI liability book?\nMichael Klein : Sure, Michael. Great question. I would say your assessment on medical inflation is right. I mean it's ticked up slightly, but from a low level. So something we pay attention to, but not a particular concern. It is interesting, we haven't spent a lot of time talking about bodily injury liability trend in PI, not because bodily injury liability trend isn't high but because it's not really high in excess of our expectation. So we've got a relatively -- I'll say, a high view of what model severity is. I think our views on it are consistent across commercial and personal lines. But again, we haven't been talking about it because it's not the item that's been the surprise, right? The vehicle severity items have been the ones that had the unexpected inflection point in the middle part of last year and remain elevated.\nMichael Phillips : Okay. Does that mean, Michael, that your BI liability is what we're seeing for the industry, it's above 10%?\nMichael Klein : I wouldn't put a specific number on it, maybe, Michael, but I would say we're in that neighbourhood.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Question on Business Insurance margins. We improved year-over-year. I realized the past couple of quarters, we've been benefiting from some favorable non-cat weather. And I guess also some frequency related items and things like commercial auto. Could you just give us --pin is a picture of sort of like to what extent did those come back this quarter into the results that we saw?\nDan Frey: Ryan, it's Dan. Yes, so not real big movements there. I think Greg gave you what's a pretty straightforward story to the quarter, about a point better in the loss ratio really tied to earned pricing being ahead of what we're seeing in the loss environment and about 1 point of improvement in the expense ratio. To your point, there are other things that will impact quarters differently and there's some variability from quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, the net of those things when we compare to what we saw in the first quarter of a year ago, it was just about a wash.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then a follow-up on the Bond & Specialty side, just trying to get a feel for how the re-underwriting of that cyber book, like what type of tailwind that could be for underwriting margins? Can you just give us an idea of maybe what percentage of the Management Liability book has a cyber component?\nJeff Klenk: Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Jeff Klenk. I think first and foremost, I'd remind you  that we do have a significant reinsurance treaty on the book of business. And so that's something that's important to remember. We do feel really confident that the focus on the cybersecurity protocols is having an impact. Still early for us, right, because we started it effective in June, but we're seeing it on the frequency. And so more to come, but we definitely feel good about the results we're seeing so far.\nDan Frey: Ryan, it's Dan. I'd just add, and I think you were getting to it in the tail end of your question. Cyber, it's not a huge percentage of the premium base within Bond & Specialty. So it's an important line of business that everybody is paying attention to, It's not a huge component of the book.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: I guess I would like to focus in on the expense ratio. And I know you've spent some time recently with investors talking about some initiatives. Dan, in your comments, and I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seemed like you were suggesting that the full year expense ratio might move to around 29.5. And then a year out, maybe 29.  And assuming that I correctly, I also noted in Jeff's comments that -- or excuse me, Michael's comments that the expense ratio benefited from higher earned premiums. So I guess I'm trying to bridge the gap between the expense ratio improvement that's coming from the higher than normal or typical premium volumes versus what the true underlying improvement in expenses is, if that makes sense?\nDan Frey: Yes, Greg, it's Dan. I'm not sure that I would try to break it into its pieces. We're managing to a total return. And within that, we're trying to manage to what we are comfortable with from an expense ratio perspective. So we made a lot of progress in improving the expense ratio from where we were 5 or 6 years ago. We're pretty -- we said when it got down to the 30 level a couple of years ago, we were pretty comfortable somewhere around 30. Coming out of last year, we signaled that we thought this year would be around 29.5. And all I was really trying to give you in my comments was that's still sort of what we're planning for, for this year. I don't know exactly where it's going to come up, but that's the neighbourhood of where we would expect it to come out A little better than that in the first quarter of the year, that's partially due to the fact that premium volumes were a little stronger than we would have expected. It's also partially due to the fact that there's some timing from quarter-to-quarter in terms of what's going to come through expenses. But we are managing the strategic investments we're making to move the business forward balanced with expense discipline to make sure that we're continuing to improve productivity and efficiency, also balanced with what our view is of where the top line is going.  So we're looking at all those -- all 3 of those things together and saying, we were in the 32s a few years ago, we got down to 30. We told you this year, we think that will go down to about 29.5 and then the next step will be to go down to 29. But it's really balancing all those 3 things together.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Makes sense. The second question I have would be just around the commentary on investment income. And I guess with the upward movement in interest rates, just trying to understand just within the fixed income component of your portfolio, where the new money yields are relative to expiring? And I know that you did raise your investment income guidance for the balance of the year. So just trying to understand some of the moving pieces behind that.\nDan Frey: Sure, Greg. It's a good question because this is the quarter in which we actually flip from new money rates being below what's embedded in the portfolio as has been the case for the past several years. By the time we exit the quarter, we're -- and you see that in the fact that the portfolio is now in an unrealized loss position as opposed to an unrealized gain position. But exiting the quarter, we think that new money yields are somewhere between 50 and 70 basis points higher than what's running off. And so as the portfolio slowly turns over, and that is contributing to our increased view compared to the outlook that we had provided at year-end in terms of what will happen to fixed income NII increasing now as we get to the latter part of 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan : My first question, a couple of times, you guys mentioned elevated severity in this inflationary environment. So just curious, within Business Insurance, you guys had been running at a 5% loss trend assumption. Where did you guys take that to, this quarter?\nDan Frey: So Elyse, it's Dan. I'll take that one and I'll say that we're thinking about, especially in this environment with exposure near all-time highs, you've got to compare what we're doing on the total pricing side, including the piece of exposure that behaves like rate with what's happening in the overall loss environment. So as you heard in Greg's comments and in Alan's comments, we have reflected a higher level of severity tied to inflation in our view of what we're booking for losses in business insurance. That's largely tied to higher levels of inflation. Higher levels of inflation also bring with it really an offsetting benefit as you think about what we'll earn in on a go-forward basis from higher exposures. So things like higher wages paid to the same workers. So we're going to get a higher exposure and a higher premium on the same risk as opposed to increases in exposure related to things like more workers where we're collecting more premium, but there's more risk because you've got additional workers. So our view of the loss environment is higher. Whether you put that in loss trend or whether you leave your loss trend unchanged and book a medium-term over-the-top severity on top, mechanically, you're going to get to the same answer. If you believe that the inflationary impact is going to be somewhat persistent at least over the medium term if you'd put it in loss trends, that's reflected in the numbers that Greg talked about in terms of a point of margin expansion in the quarter and in the commentary that on a written basis with the production results we saw this quarter, we expect margins to continue to expand going forward.\nElyse Greenspan : Okay. I don't want to -- I get that it impacts both sides of the equation. I mean it seems like it probably went up maybe to 5.5%, maybe even 6%. Do you want to -- can you provide the magnitude of the increase? Or do you rather just talk through the components of the positive and the negative aspects of exposure and loss trend?\nDan Frey: I think, directionally, that's the way to think about it, Elyse. But keep in mind, as you said, there is both sides of the equation, and we're going to and are seeing the benefit on the exposure piece as well.\nElyse Greenspan : Okay. And then Alan and Greg, both of you guys also talked, right, about strong retention, just showing the stability of the market, and you guys saw pretty good growth in all of your businesses. But sticking with BI, if we're talking about elevated loss trend pricing getting close to that loss trend, can you just help us think through why now it seems like a good time to kind of show higher premium growth?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Elyse, just as a reminder, we've had this conversation over the years. We go out and hold up a sign that says grow or shrink. We execute one account at a time. And when there's an account out there and the pricing turns, we want to put in the portfolio we do. And this quarter, Greg and his team did a fantastic job. And the result of that, again, the accounts we want -- the pricing turns we want resulted in that growth. So it's not -- there's no sort of overall coaching message other than go out and execute the next account.  Greg, you want to --\nGreg Toczydlowski: I think that's exactly right. I think through this cycle, we've been -- had the benefit of -- have a high-quality book of business. So we haven't really had to remediate broadly from an underwriting point of view. It has been just fun being for some of these perils that we've talked about. So we're very pleased with when we add up all the numbers and see the execution at a very granular level from our most profitable accounts to our least profitable what that retention slope looks like, and we're very comfortable with that.\nDan Frey: And keep in mind, Elyse, we're talking about very strong margins at the time and saying, even at this level, we continue to expect that we're expanding margins. I mean these are some of the best underlying combined ratio that Business Insurance has seen in the last 14 or 15 years. So to have retention at all-time highs when margins are as strong as they are, feels great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: A couple of questions on ROEs. So I think you had a 13% operating ROE last year. You have 3x investment leverage. So if you got another point of interest rates increases coming in through the portfolio, you get another 2 points of ROE. So you're essentially at the ROE target, I think, for the cycle with higher interest rates. So with that in mind, would you kind of expect to take the foot off the rate and terms and conditions pedal to achieve greater growth? Or do you think there is more for the underwriting side?\nAlan Schnitzer: I -- well, first of all, I think it's hard to talk with -- with such a broad brush. We've got -- I assume you're directing your comments to BI. It's a $16 billion book of business with lots of different products. So it's hard to paint with a broad brush. We will -- as you heard, this quarter, written margins continue to expand, that will earn in, and we continue to execute from here and to continue to improve margins. If we're going to try to be mid-teens over the cycle, that means at some point, ideally you get above it. Having said that, we got a 10-year treasury that it's on the move, but it's still not near sort of historical norms. It's even at 28 or 29, by historical standards is relatively low. So that does impact our earn rate and what we're trying to achieve. And then the last thing I'd say is, from here, the price change is going to increase in some lines of sub-businesses, its going to go sideways in some and it's going to go down in other. So it's -- that's just a function of granular execution.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question on returns. I think the stock is currently at 1 6 book ex-AOCI, which I think would suggest that you need a roughly 16% ROE to breakeven on buybacks here. So with that, maybe you can talk a little bit about your preferred avenue of capital deployment at this time? Is it to really achieve more growth as margins are expanding? Or do you expect to do more buyback?\nAlan Schnitzer: Let me start, Yaron. So on the -- way we think about it -- and I think it's important to go through the whole chain here. We generate more capital than we need to -- that we can profitably deploy back into our business. And so when we have more capital than we need, we're going to get it back. And that is sort of a philosophical principle that we've operated under for a pretty long time. And so we've got a couple of options on how we're going to get it back. And we know we've got certain segment of our shareholder population that's looking for a dividend yield, and we're going to make sure that we're paying to be competitive. And then beyond that, we're going to buy our stock back. And we're not investing in our stock. We're not trying to time the market, we're trying to rightsize capital. And we've bought back plenty of stock at these levels over the years. And we started our stock buyback program in 2006, I think. And the average price per share, which we bought back the stock, is about $70. So I really to think about it in that broader context, it's been -- it's been an exercise in capital management for us, but it's been a fantastic investment over the years. And I think when you look back at this moment in time, years from now, you're going to say the same thing.\nDan Frey: Yes, I echo those exact same thoughts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays.\nTracy Benguigui: Just one question for me. It's a follow-up to Dan's comments about holding assets to maturity, reminding us on a statutory perspective that unrealized losses on investments doesn't really matter for regulatory capital purposes. I just wanted to ask if the same is true on your internal economic capital model and how you think about capital allocation?\nDan Frey: Yes, pretty much, Tracy. I mean we -- which is one of the reasons why when we talk about book value per share, we almost always talk about adjusted book value per share, the unrealized gain or loss position in the portfolio, we think of as we have duration in the portfolio, interest rates are going to move, we're going to have an unrealized gain or loss, it's not really driving the economics of how we think about the capital position of the company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: I was hoping to start with a question for Michael. I understand that we're ramping up rate increases and they going to earn in going forward for personal auto. But I guess I was surprised with the level of new business growth and retention, and I'm wondering whether the strategy now is to write a fair amount of business as competitors dial down advertising and count on overall market rates rising and therefore, the ability to retain some of that business? In other words, are you writing business below target margins right now in auto with the expectation that probably it picks over time?\nMichael Klein : Yes. Thanks, Meyer. It's Michael. I would say the strategy is to get the rate we need to improve the profitability. And the growth that you're seeing is a byproduct of how our rate shows up in the market relative to that of our competitors. And actually, when you look underneath it, on a state-by-state basis, you actually see quote volumes moving around based on industry rate level, I think more industry rate being taken in the state drives quotes into the market. You also see our close rate varying in one state versus another based on the rate level that we've taken and how that compares to our competitors. So it's really less about looking for growth on a tactical basis, it's really all about looking at the rate indications, recognizing that we need to make progress on pricing and filing the indications and the rate request with the states and getting them in as quickly as we can and the growth you're seeing is a byproduct.  I would say, to your point, retention dipped a bit from 85 to 84, again, relatively consistent with what we would have anticipated given the change in RPC. And while new business production, the dollars were up 4%, which is the same number, they were up in the prior quarter, in the fourth quarter of 2021. More of that 4% is now represented by price change than was in the prior. So there's some slight deceleration kind of in the underlying growth. And we anticipate as we continue to push for rate, we'll probably see some more of that.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. No, that makes sense. I guess, bigger picture question, so maybe for Alan. Unlike last quarter, there was no mention at least that I could catch the pandemic have any impact on the underlying loss ratio. Is that a correct read? In other words, that that particular component doesn't seem to be relevant anymore?\nAlan Schnitzer: I would say, Meyer, and I'm looking at Dan, very small.\nDan Frey: Yes. And it also gets, Meyer, sort more and more difficult. So in terms of did we have any sort of directly COVID-related charges that become a very -- it was never a big story for us in the first place, and it's certainly not a big story now. Then in terms of the underlying loss environment, other -- things that were indirectly impacted by COVID, I think it just gets sort of harder and harder to parse out what is a change in COVID and what is just the new normal in terms of whether it's people working from home or things like that. So I think your reading is right. There's not a big story in the quarter related to COVID.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJosh Shanker: A couple of questions. Can we speak to fourth quarter and first quarter? Obviously, there's a big change in the loss ratio underlying. Were there specific items? And if I read through the queue as quickly as I could, it didn't seem like you're calling out anything unusual there. And making the sequential comparison, is there anything that you want to point out between the 2 quarters? Anything we should think about?\nDan Frey: Josh, are you talking about on a consolidated basis or one of the segments.\nJosh Shanker: I'm sorry, Business Insurance, of course. Yes, Business Insurance.\nDan Frey: Okay. So I think there is seasonality in different parts of the segments. Greg did call out in his fourth quarter comments, whether property losses, not related to cat, were a little better than our expectations. And I think we've had this conversation, Josh, before. We really don't think about the think about that sort of sequential quarter-to-quarter reconciliation. There are different things that occur in different quarters. So I think the most apples-to-apples comparison in our view is Q1 versus Q1, and that's the way we do it.\nJosh Shanker: That's fine. And then on workers' compensation, obviously, a big part of the favorable development in Business Insurance in the quarter. Can we talk about what you're seeing in the segments? Or I should say, the lines of business other than worker\u2019s comp on prior year development and whatnot?\nDan Frey: Sure. So in BI for the quarter, we -- so again, the pieces I gave you, $113 million in total for the quarter for BI, the largest piece being comp, that was $80 million to $85 million. I gave you the -- we had $45 million of a charge for environmental related to the older years. So that leaves you with the other things. So the general liability lines, a fair amount of favorability spread across many accident years property, a modest amount of favorability spread across many accident years, CMP, net favorability from a number of accident years, and the international business showed some favorable development in PYD as well. None of those things were sort of individually significant, which is why I didn't call them out in my comments, but we saw favorable development in those lines as well.\nJosh Shanker: So it's fair to say universally favorable across all lines, the takeaway I would come with?\nDan Frey: Yes. The one line I didn't mention was auto and not because it was a huge outlier, but I don't think that the net result of auto is much more than a wash within Business Insurance.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Scott: First one I had was just a follow-up on cyber. And I was just interested in, if you could provide any commentary on the kind of war exclusions you have. And I know this is a real big business for you, but I'd just be interested in that. And any claims experience you're seeing so far from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, if at all?\nJeff Klenk: Thanks, Alex. This is Jeff Klenk. Relative to the second part of your question, no active experience relative to the current situation. And there has been, obviously, a little more dialogue on this topic recently. Relative to our offering, we're comfortable with the cyber offerings exclusionary language, have no immediate plans to change it. As always, we'll continue to monitor our policy language in the context of evolving risks. But thanks for the question.\nAlex Scott: Got it. And maybe just one more follow-up on frequency. I think Josh and Ryan both asked about this a little bit. But any way you can quantify at all for us just any frequency benefits that still remain for workers' comp and GL specifically and BI? Just thinking through, I guess, that there's sort of a wash when you look at the items year-over-year comparison wise. But when we think about it relative to pre-pandemic and appreciate may or may not actually revert to those levels. But I'm just trying to gauge if there's still a benefit there we should be considering?\nDan Frey: Yes, pretty -- to the degree that there's any, Alex, I think it's pretty small. The other thing that we've used to describe reserving in the uncertainty of the sort of COVID environment and core closure environment is that we've tried to remain cautious. And so I think we have tried to remain cautious. So even though -- some of the data might still be indicating some modest benefits from frequency, we're making sure that we're booking losses to allow for what might come through either later or on the severity side. So not really a big benefit coming through the quarter.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Alex, I'd just add on the workers' comp comment, obviously, as the economy starts opening up again, we would start to see some of the frequency normalization, which we have seen in the workers' comp line, but certainly add expectations, nothing above that. So like what we were expecting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: I just had a question on Business Insurance and the commentary around written rate being above loss trend and really just trying to drill down and thinking about just how much exposure is acting like rate. And so if I just compare the 4.4 renewal rate change in Business Insurance with the loss trend of, call it, 5% to 6%, it implies that to expand margin, you would need around 1 point to 1.5 points of the exposure change that's acting as rate. I'm just wondering, is this the right way to think about it roughly just like 1 point of the 5 points of exposure change acting as rate?\nDan Frey: David, it's Dan. I think, mathematically, if you just took a point in that equation, that would get you to somewhere around breakeven, and we're telling you that we think on a written basis, margins are still expanding. It is difficult, and I appreciate what everybody is trying to do. It's difficult to have a rule of thumb for how much exposure behaves like rate, because as I said in the answer to an earlier question, the things that are driving exposure can vary from period to period, whether it's inflation driven or units of risk driven, the lines of business mix changes from quarter-to-quarter and that impacts it. But I think the short answer, I would say is when we're looking at the level of exposure that we wrote in the first quarter, I think more than 1 point of that, we think of as behaving like rate, but I really wouldn't try to put much finer point on it than that. The other thing I'll just add, David, is loss trend for this purpose is really a very blunt instrument. And that sort of one number aggregating loss trend across that we look at it at a very granular level. So we just don't approach it at the sort of macro \u2013 sort of level that you do, which is I think why we're all sort of looking at each other wondering how to respond to that. And I get -- just trying to get to some measure of cost of goods sold, it's just a blunt instrument, and it's hard to do. And the other thing I'll say is loss trend frequency changes in long-term view of frequency and severity, that's just a mechanic for booking losses and there are other mechanics for booking losses. And so it's just -- it's really the only thing impacting a quarter. So I just \u2013 just cautioning you against the -- looking at something that seems very simple and thinking that's the answer.\nOperator: We currently have time for one final question. Your final question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yes Alan, I want to chat a little bit about Business Insurance a little more, broadly speaking here. As we look at GDP in the U.S., as you guys look back, how closely correlated is exposure growth and RPC relative to GDP in the U.S.? Is there a lag effect? And then maybe take that also on loss trend? And what impact you typically see economic growth or deceleration having on loss trend?\nAlan Schnitzer: It's a really good point, a really good question. We do see exposure growth having a reasonably high, not 1:1, but a reasonably high degree of correlation with GDP. So I do think you're onto something there. Again, it's within a range and there's some lag to it. But -- and that's also sort of an overtime measure. I don't think you can look at GDP today this week, this month, this quarter and say that's what exposure is going to be. You do need to look at it sort of overtime as you generally get there. When you talk about the impact of economic activity and losses, that's also going to vary by line, and it's hard to paint with a broad brush. I do think probably just making an observation at a macro level, there is a correlation between an economy heating up and loss trend going up. I think there are several lines that would contribute to that. But what you do need to remember, again, to the first point is that as an economy heats up, you do get exposure growth that to 1 degree or another, offset that higher level of loss trend.\nBrian Meredith: Makes sense. And then my second question, just quickly here. You've talked a lot about the severity side on BI and inflation. I'm just curious, what are you seeing as the court system opens up in the U.S.? Are you seeing kind of a return to the old social inflation environment we were seeing back in 2018, '19? \nAlan Schnitzer: I will tell you, we absolutely expect that. I don't think the court system is opening up yet. I mean it's opening up and unwinding very slowly, and I think it's going to play out over a while. You think by now that it would be open and running at pre-pandemic levels, and it's just not. But our full expectation, Brian, is consistent with your comment, we would expect to see that pre-pandemic environment in terms of of social inflation.\nOperator: Ms. Goldstein, I will turn the call back over to you now for closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you all very much for joining us. We appreciate your time. And as always, if there's any follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations, and have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report exceptional top and bottom line results for the quarter. Core income earnings per share and return on equity were all record highs, driven by both underwriting and investment results. Our underwriting gains were broad-based in each of our three segments underlying underwriting income was higher and prior year development was favorable. Catastrophe losses were also light. Record underlying underwriting income resulted from net earned premiums of $10 billion, up more than 13% over the prior year quarter and an underlying combined ratio, which improved 5.5 points to a record 85.9%. Looking at our two commercial segments together. The aggregate BI/BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 85.9% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in personal insurance was coincidentally also 85.9%, an improvement of more than 10 points year-over-year. In addition, we are pleased to have delivered full year core income of $3.1 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.5%. Notwithstanding elevated industry wide catastrophe losses earlier in the year and a personal lines operating environment that while improving was difficult during the year. Turning to investments. Our high quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating after tax net investment income of $645 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio. Our operating results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 8% during the year, after making important investments in our business and returning nearly $2 billion of excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to the topline. We grew net written premiums by 13% to $10 billion in the quarter. For the year, we grew net written premiums by 14% to more than $40 billion. All three segments contributed to our topline success. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums in the quarter by 14% to more than $5 billion. Renewal premium change remained high at 11.8%. Our retention also remained high at 87%. The combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and a disciplined marketplace. The segment generated $672 million of new business in the quarter, which is a $118 million or about 20% higher than in the prior year quarter. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7% to $989 million, driven by excellent production in our surety business, where net written premiums were up 9%. Production was also strong in our management liability business. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 21.2% in home and 16.7% in our auto business. Renewal premium change alone contributed more than $2 billion of written premium in this segment over the past year. With another strong production -- with another year of strong production in each of our segments, we feel very well positioned for the new year. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to take a minute and put our 2023 results into an overtime context with an update to some data we shared previously. A half dozen or so years ago, we laid out a focused innovation strategy, ensure that if we were successful in this execution, we would expect to grow our business at attractive returns. A reflection of our belief that any strategy to achieve industry-leading returns over time requires a strategy to grow over time. The data on Slide 19 of the webcast presentation show the success we've achieved. Starting at the top left corner. In terms of the top line, we've grown net written premiums at a compound annual rate of 7% over the past seven years, that's 2.5 times our rate of growth from 2012 to 2016. The growth rate in each of the past two years was double-digits, the result of a deliberate and tailored strategy, stronger pricing where we need it and a combination of pricing and unit growth where we like the opportunity. In Business Insurance, we've added more than $4 billion to our top line over the past two years. The investments we've made in capabilities to enhance the franchise value that we offer to our customers and distribution partners have contributed to strong retentions and growth in new business. In Bond & Specialty, we've increased net written premiums over that period by about $0.5 billion or 14%. More than half of that growth has come from a very profitable surety business, where our market leading position has enabled us to benefit from increased demand for bonds with higher contract values and projects resulting from the Federal Infrastructure and Jobs Act and other federal programs. Across both of our commercial segments, since 2021, we have about doubled our E&S writings to around $2.5 billion. That includes organic growth from the E&S business we write in National Property, our North field business and our Lloyd's business, as well as the impact of more recent strategic efforts, which include our relationships with Fidelis and Corvus. The margins in our E&S business are quite attractive. In Personal Insurance, where margins have not been at target levels in recent periods. Net written premium growth of $3.4 billion over the past two years has been almost entirely a result of price increases. The PI team has done an excellent job of threading the needle, maintaining a strong customer base while achieving meaningful pricing gains. They've also done a great job with private product management. Our advanced peril-by-peril Quantum Auto 2.0 offering now represents more than 60% of the domestic property portfolio. And adoption of our telematics product and teledrive among new customers has been strong. With pricing gains and enhanced product sophistication, the book should contribute to our earnings power going forward as we move to our target returns. Also important is that across all three segments, we've grown mostly in products, classes of business and geographies and through distribution partners that we know well, that gives us a lot of confidence in the business we're adding to the books. Moving to the right, you can see that while we've meaningfully increased our rate of growth, we've maintained very strong and consistent underlying profitability. That demonstrates that we're not growing by underpricing the business or compromising our underwriting discipline. We've grown by investing in the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell. We've also grown through a lot of great hustle and hard work on the part of our outstanding field organization. One of the clear strategic objectives of our innovation strategy has been to optimize productivity and efficiency. Moving to the top right of the slide, you can see that over the last seven years, we've reduced our expense ratio by 3.6 points to just over 28% for 2023, which is more than a 10% reduction relative to our 2012 to 2016 expense ratio of around 32%. Enhanced operating leverage gives us the flexibility to let the benefit fall to the bottom line and/or invest further in our strategic priorities. Case in point, as you can see on Slide 21, since 2017, we have doubled our investments in strategic technology initiatives. Over that same period, we've carefully managed growth in routine but necessary technology expenditures. In other words, over a seven year period, we simultaneously and meaningfully increased our technology spend, improve the strategic mix of that spend, and lowered our expense ratio. The upshot of what we've accomplished on the top half of Slide 19 is what you see on the bottom half. On the bottom left, you can see that we've increased underlying underwriting income significantly. From 2012 to 2019, underlying underwriting income averaged $1.3 billion. In 2020, we crossed the $2 billion mark and 2023 marks the first time that we've exceeded $3 billion. We've taken our underlying underwriting income to a meaningfully higher level. We've also significantly increased our cash flow from operations to more than $7.5 billion in 2023. The fourth consecutive year it's been more than $6 billion and more than double our average cash flow from operations in the earlier part of the last decade. Cash flow isn't a metric that we or our industry talk a lot about, but it's important. It's what gives us the ability to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders and grow the investment portfolio. We've grown our investment portfolio significantly to nearly $93 billion. As we continue to reinvest our fixed income portfolio at higher rates, this is a highly reliable lever of earnings and value creation. To sum it up through a well-executed strategy, we've more than doubled our rate of growth, sustained strong underlying underwriting margins and meaningfully lowered our expense ratio. That has resulted in record levels of underlying underwriting income, cash flow and invested assets. Ultimately, of course, one number that brings everything together is adjusted book value per share. On Slide 20, you can see that we have steadily increased adjusted book value per share each year since 2006 at a compound annual rate of 7.5%. The effective management of our capital complements that result. We've increased our capital base to support the profitable growth of our business. At the same time, we've been disciplined about returning excess capital to shareholders. Over this period, we've increased our dividend at a compound annual rate of more than 8% and returned more than $40 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases at an average price of about $74 per share. These results, together with our track record of strong returns and low volatility demonstrate the strength of our business and the success of our overtime strategy. Looking ahead, we're very confident about how we're positioned for 2024 and beyond. The fundamentals across our business are in excellent shape. We're confident that we're focused on the right strategic priorities and that with demonstrated success in execution, there's plenty more opportunity ahead of us. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, and core return on equity was 24%, both all-time record quarterly results. We're pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 85.9%, a 5.5 point improvement from last year's quarter. The combination of premium growth and underlying margin improvement led to underlying underwriting income of $1.1 billion after tax, up $511 million or 89% from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio improved from the prior year in all three segments. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter improved by 0.5 point from last year's quarter to 27.4%, once again, reflecting the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. The full year expense ratio of 28.1% was our best ever. As Alan mentioned, our focus is on operating leverage. And looking ahead to 2024, we're comfortable with the annual expense ratio in the range of 28% to 28.5% for now. Our fourth quarter results include a modest $125 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses with no individually significant events impacting our book of business. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $132 million pre-tax, with all three segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $56 million was driven by favorability in workers' comp that was partially offset by adverse development in umbrella and general liability. Even after the reserve charge, the returns in both umbrella and GL remain very attractive. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $36 million was driven by better than expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal Insurance had $40 million of net favorable PYD driven by homeowners and other. After tax net investment income of $645 million was up 21% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also higher than in the prior year quarter. In terms of our outlook for fixed income NII for 2024, including earnings from short-term securities, we expect approximately $2.6 billion after tax, beginning with approximately $630 million in the first quarter and growing to approximately $675 million in the fourth quarter. Page 22 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 catastrophe reinsurance renewal. Our long standing CAT XOL Treaty continues to provide coverage for both single CAT events and the aggregation of losses from multiple CAT events. And we've increased the amount of total coverage for 2024. Despite the growth in our property book, our attachment point remains steady, and the per occurrence loss deductible is unchanged at $100 million. For 2024, we have placed coverage for $3.5 billion of the $4.5 billion layer above the $3.5 billion attachment point. We're pleased to have obtained the extra protection in light of the recent inflationary impact on insured values. With context, we've never hit this treaty. Nonetheless, this is prudent, affordable balance sheet protection for tail events. The cost of the additional reinsurance will be largely offset by the strong renewal pricing we continue to achieve on our direct written property premiums resulting in only a de minimis impact on the underlying combined ratio. On a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 23 of the webcast presentation. As we enter 2024, we thought it would be helpful to once again highlight the seasonality of our CAT losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest CAT quarter. CAT losses in the second quarter have been, on average, more than three combined ratio points higher than in any other quarter and the second quarter has been our largest CAT quarter in seven of the past 10 years. Also of interest for 2024, in light of continued strong pricing and terms in the E&S and reinsurance markets, we are pleased to share that we have renewed the 20% quota share with Fidelis. The renewal includes the same loss ratio cap we had for 2023. The written premium volume, which will again be included as part of international within the Business Insurance segment is not expected to be material to the segment. but should have a modestly favorable impact on the underlying combined ratio for 2024 as it earns in. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.1 billion were again very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. As you may have seen, S&P issued their updated capital model, and we now expect that the result of the new model will be a modest improvement in their assessment of our capital metrics. Interest rates decreased and spreads narrowed during the quarter. And as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $6.5 billion after tax at September 30 to $3.1 billion after tax at year end. As we've discussed previously, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity, the quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have a little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $122.90 at year end, up 8% from a year ago. We returned $298 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $66 million and dividends of $232 million. We have approximately $6 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Thinking about share repurchases in 2024, while there is no change in our capital management philosophy, we will factor in the need for increased capital in light of our top line growth as well as the $435 million we just deployed to complete the Corvus acquisition. Currently, we expect repurchases in the first quarter of somewhere around $250 million. Recapping our results for 2023. Core income was $3.1 billion, and core ROE was 11.5%. We delivered our highest ever levels of written premium, earned premium, underlying underwriting income and cash flow from operations. In addition, we ended the year with our all-time high in adjusted book value per share and with our largest investment portfolio ever. We've never been better positioned for the year ahead. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding on a terrific year in terms of financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. Last year at this time, I indicated that we were firing on all cylinders, and that certainly remains the case today. Segment income for the quarter was $957 million, our highest quarter ever and up well over $200 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower catastrophes. The all-in combined ratio of 86.5% was a great result, and we're once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 86.8% and an all-time best result. The underlying loss ratio improved by almost 2.5 points from the prior year quarter, with the drivers of the improvement, including the benefit of earned pricing a mix shift to the property line and an impact from non-CAT weather that was modestly favorable to both the prior year and our expectations. The expense ratio remained excellent at 28.8%. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 14% from the prior year to a fourth quarter record of $5 billion, benefiting from high retention, strong renewal premium change and increase in new business levels. As Alan mentioned, given the attractive margins in this segment, we're very pleased with this growth. Turning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 11.8%, with renewal rate change of 7.4% and continued strong growth and exposure. Renewal rate change increased from the third quarter in select and middle market, however, ticked down at the segment level, driven almost entirely by a lower mix of national property written premium in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Retention remained excellent at 87% and new business of $672 million was the strongest fourth quarter we've ever produced. We're thrilled with these production results and our field superior execution in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to be able to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change to address the persistent environmental headwinds. As for renewal rate change, during the quarter, we achieved meaningful renewal rate increases in all lines other than workers' comp. The property, umbrella and auto lines led the way. Renewal rate change in each of the casualty lines was comparable or better than the third quarter. And given our high quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remained strong at 11.9%, up more than 1.5 point (ph) from the third quarter driven by renewal rate change, which increased to 4.1% for the quarter. Even with strong pricing, retention remained very strong at 85%. New business was up $49 million from the prior year quarter driven in large part by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In middle market, renewal premium change of 10.4% and retention of 90% remained historically strong. New business of $348 million was an all-time best fourth quarter result. As we close out 2023, let me provide a little color on full year results before turning the call over to Jeff. Segment income was nearly $2.6 billion, an exceptional result. The underlying combined ratio of 88.9%, top line of $20.4 billion renewal premium change, retention and new business premiums were all record results. These results are a direct reflection of our successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies. And while delivering these financial and production results, we've also continued to invest in strategic capabilities that will enhance our many competitive advantages. For example, during the year, we continued to advance our data and analytics capabilities by leveraging evolving technologies, including AI, and new data sources to help us manage the portfolio and equip our frontline underwriters with data and insights to better enable our risk selection, underwriting and pricing. In addition, we continued to advance our already state-of-the-art product and service capabilities by continuing to roll out our BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in all but a couple of states, as well as our new commercial auto product, which is now live in 14 states. Both products deliver industry-leading segmentation and user experiences. In addition, we continue to make progress on developing other industry leading user experience capabilities to make it easier and more efficient for our distribution partners and customers to do business with us. In particular, in our middle market business, we advanced our capabilities around digitizing the underwriting transaction for our agents and brokers. In our Small Commercial business, we continued to roll out our new front end rate quote and issue interface platform to make it faster and easier for our agents to write business with us, while maintaining all the underwriting discipline and specialization behind the scenes. And finally, we continued to improve our operating leverage through our relentless focus on productivity and efficiency. We're proud of these extraordinary results in the best-in-class team that produce them. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Fund & Specialty ended a strong 2023 with a terrific quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $240 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter. delivered very strong underlying underwriting income and an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 80.6%. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 7% in the quarter. In our high quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90%, in line with the prior year quarter, while continuing to achieve positive renewal premium change. New business was up driven by a new domestic cyber capacity agreement with Corvus. Surety net written premiums increased 9%, reflecting continued strong demand for surety bonds. So we're pleased to have once again delivered terrific top and bottom line results this quarter, capping off a year during which we generated record segment income and net written premium. Finally, we're pleased that earlier this month, we closed our previously announced acquisition of Corvus Insurance. Corvus is an industry leading cyber insurance managing general underwriter, powered by proprietary technology. Corvus has developed cutting edge capabilities, including digitally integrated cyber sales, underwriting, service and support, sophisticated underwriting algorithms and advanced vulnerability scanning. Corvus also brings deep cyber underwriting and risk management expertise, and we're pleased to welcome them to the Travelers family. This acquisition affords us the opportunity to write Corvus' profitable book of business which will be reflected as new business in our production results over the course of 2024. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Personal Insurance generated $520 million of fourth quarter segment income, strong results and a significant improvement compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.9% improved over 10 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting improvements in both automobile and homeowners and other. Net written premiums grew 13%, driven by continued elevated levels of renewal premium change in both auto and home bringing full year net written premiums to a record of nearly $16 billion. In automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 103.6%, the underlying combined ratio of 102.7% improved nearly 8 points compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing. To a lesser extent, it also benefited from the year-over-year impact of a modest favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year compared to a modest unfavorable re-estimation in the prior year quarter. In Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 70.8% improved by over 28 points, reflecting catastrophe losses that were favorable to both the prior year quarter and our expectations and an improved underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio improved 12.5 points, primarily due to non-catastrophe weather-related losses that were favorable to both the prior year and our expectations and the impact of earned pricing. Turning to production. Our results demonstrate our continued disciplined execution of rate and non-rate actions to improve profitability and manage growth. In domestic automobile retention remained consistent. Renewal premium change of 16.7% remains strong and as expected, moderated from the third quarter of 2023 and as the majority of our book reached rate adequacy on a written basis. We expect renewal premium change to remain in the mid-teens through the first half of 2024 as we continue to assess the environment and seek rate on a state-by-state basis as appropriate. We're pleased to note that auto new business increased relative to the prior year quarter, as we tempered our non-rate actions in states where we've achieved written rate adequacy. We will continue to evaluate our non-rate measures as more states reach adequacy throughout 2024. In Homeowners and Other, retention remained consistent even as renewal premium change reached a record level at 21.2%, primarily driven by higher renewal rate change. As we noted last quarter, we expect homeowners' renewal premium change to moderate to low double-digits in 2024. We will continue to see great increases in response to elevated loss levels. But at the same time, our automatic increase in limit factors will return to more normal levels, reflecting the progress we've made on aligning insured values with replacement costs. Our continued efforts to manage new business flow and thoughtfully deploy capacity in the face of market dislocation drove the year-over-year decline in homeowners new business and policies enforced during the quarter. We anticipate this trend will continue as we take further actions to improve profitability and manage growth in property. In 2023, we made notable progress on improving the underlying fundamentals of our business and are moving towards our goal of delivering target returns. While the environment remains dynamic, we're confident we're on a path to generating leading returns in Personal Insurance and growing profitably over time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks very much. We're happy to open up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on the Business Insurance underlying loss ratio. And if you could seize the components of the improvement between earned pricing above trend the light non-CAT weather as well as the property mix shift?\nDan Frey: Hey, David. It's Dan. So we're not going to put numbers on them. But price versus trend has been favorable throughout the last couple of years and was favorable again -- favorable again this quarter. A little bit of a mix shift towards property, as Greg said, and modestly favorable non-CAT weather impact, not huge but worth to mention, but we're not going to put numbers on each of those.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And then I think it's been five of the last seven quarters or something like that where you guys called out the general liability and umbrella as areas of reserve increases in Business Insurance. I'm wondering if we could get a little bit more detail about exactly what you guys are seeing and reacting to, and if you think we're closer to the end of some of these true-ups?\nDan Frey: Sure, David. It's Dan, again. So not big, big movements this quarter, more of the same, more of what we\u2019ve sort of been talking about the last couple of quarters, which is no surprises in terms of the themes of the things that we\u2019re seeing come through those numbers, but the magnitude has been a little greater than we had allowed for previously, and we\u2019re just looking at the data that comes in every quarter and try to make sure we stay as current with it as we can. And so a modest reaction to keep up with that, but nothing really new.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGreg Peters: Good morning, everyone. Well, first of all, you had a great fourth quarter, so congratulations. But I wanted to focus on Slide 7, the return on equity slide and you guys have all mapped out really a pretty strong outlook. And I guess, I'm trying to reconcile what is looks to be a very pretty good outlook with the fact that your ROE is running below where I think it should be. I feel like the ROE should be running higher. So maybe, Alan, you can provide some perspectives because I know the ROE is an important factor that you guys look at.\nDan Frey: Hey, Greg. It's Dan. I'll start. So look, 11.5% for ROE for a full year, pretty good number, another year, double-digits, well above our cost of capital. and the risk-free rate, not quite where we'd like it to be. And I think the biggest contributor, and as you called out, Slide 7 is that yellow bar from the contribution from underwriting really impacted, as we talked about, especially in the second quarter and the third quarter by a very elevated level of catastrophe losses for the year, that's not what we expect to be the new normal run rate. We're certainly factoring more recent CAT experience into our view of CAT expectations going forward, but we wouldn't expect it to be elevated at that level.\nAlan Schnitzer: Greg, it's Alan. The other thing I would add to that is, I won't tell you would do, but one of the things I do every quarter is, is try to take a stab at normalizing these things. And so eliminate prior year development and put in for CATs, whatever you think is a normalized CAT number and then you get a different perspective.\nGreg Peters: Right. Okay. And then Dan, I just wanted to go back to your comments about share repurchase and uses of capital. I know you talked about the expectation for what's going to happen in the first quarter, and you talked about capital. Are there any other things you'd like to call out in terms of capital allocation outside of dividends and share repurchase.\nAlan Schnitzer: Let me start with that, and then I'll see what observations Dan has on that. So I think we've said for a very long time, our first objective for every dollar of capital we generate is to invest it back in the business when we think we can do that and achieve our objectives and contribute to shareholder value. But we think we've got a long track record that demonstrates our discipline with shareholders' capital. And so we're going to invest the money back in the business when we can and that could be keeping capital on the balance sheet to support profitable growth. It could be buying things like Corvus. It could be investing in technology or people doing the things that we think we can do that are accretive to our objectives. And when we can't do that, we're going to give the dollars back. So it's a long-winded way of saying no change at all in our capital management plans (ph). Dan, you want to add?\nDan Frey: I agree entirely. There's no hidden message in there, Greg. It's business as usual.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the Fidelis relationship. Dan, I think you called out and said you expect a modest favorable impact in 2024. Could you just give us a sense of how favorable that deal was to \u201823 margins within BI and how we should think about the year-over-year improvement you guys are expecting in '24 versus '23?\nDan Frey: Sure, Elyse. It's Dan. So really not going to put a very fine number on it. Keep in mind now that Fidelis is now a standalone public company. They haven't reported results yet. I don't think it would be appropriate for us to give an outlook of what we felt about their profitability. But it was a modest help in 2023, it will be a modest help again in 2024, there'll be a little bigger base of earned premium as we'll have two years' worth of written impacting 2024. So worth calling out as a modest benefit, but not a big number, and I really don't think it would be appropriate for us to try to put a finer number on it than that.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you. Then on, within personal auto, what percent of your states or premium still have non-rate restrictions in place.\nMichael Klein: Elyse, I don't think we'll get more specific than the majority, but you can think of the non-rate restrictions as tracking very closely with where we see written adequacy state-by-state. So the majority of the premium is in states where we have relaxed some of those or tempered some of those non-rate actions because the majority of premium is in states where we\u2019ve got target returns on a written basis. And again, as I indicated in the \u2013 in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ll continue to follow that path as more states get adequate will temper actions in those states as they reach adequacy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I guess my question is just looking at the rate slides. We saw an acceleration of pricing in middle market in Select obviously, a decelerated headline. So I'm guessing that means there's deceleration in national property. Could you just, I guess, talk a little bit about the relative pricing dynamics in those three markets?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Good morning, Ryan. It's Greg. Yeah. You can see, if you look at underneath the pricing, you can see rate is up in both the middle market and Select business. So the residual that makes up the total BI, you're correct, the preponderance of that is national property. And so a couple of dynamics this quarter in National Property One is when that plays out to the total book, we did have less weight on a net written premium national property this quarter, quarter four versus quarter three and quarter two. And we did have a tick down overall in rates national property also just given where the returns are in that business, and the business is performing extremely well.\nAlan Schnitzer: But make no mistake, Ryan, the overall rate change and renewal price change in the property line continues to be very strong.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. Thanks. And then just a follow-up. We're not used to seeing this type of margin expansion in Business Insurance. I would think that would mean that's largely attributable to short tail lines. But I guess I was also curious, obviously, rate's been running an excessive onstream and casualties well for a while. We have been really talked about changing loss picks or anything like that. But was there a change on the casualty side to I guess, loss picks in the fourth quarter? Any true-up to the current year or something like that we should be aware of?\nDan Frey: No, Ryan. It's Dan. Like, if we have an unusual item in the quarter that's sort of non-run rate, we'll usually try and call it out for you, including some kind of year-to-date catch-up, Michael referred to it in PI auto, but you didn't hear Greg talk about anything significant in BI because there wasn't really anything significant in BI. So we do \u2013 what we always do, right, go through all the lines there\u2019s puts and takes across every line, looking at frequency and severity. But on the whole, no big change in our view of blended trend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Happy Friday. First question is maybe looking for a little bit more color on some of the pleasantly surprising commentary about the general liability and umbrella returns still being very good despite but someone else had pointed out, was five of the last seven quarters adding to reserves. So just curious, is there any more -- can you elaborate on that? Is that maybe you're taking into account the -- you don't typically hear that. Maybe it's the investment income that's helping or its sold as part of a package. And so the rest of the products are running at better returns or anything you could add to that? Thanks.\nDan Frey: Hey, Mike. It's Dan. So we're thinking about the returns, and that is our all-in view of return, but we are specifically looking at those lines when we make that comment, although, we do, to your point, also pay a lot of attention to returns on an account basis. But those comments were specific to the liability and umbrella lines. And this really goes back to the comment that Alan made a couple of quarters ago, which is -- the amounts that were, I'll say, tweaking prior year reserve development by is really pretty modest in the scope and the scheme of those reserves. And when we look at the total volume of business that we're writing and the returns on an over time basis, we still both like both of those lines very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Another way to think about it, Mike, might be that you think about it in terms of rate adequacy and you might have an attractive rate adequacy, you might make an adjustment to it. It might be to one degree or another, slightly less rate adequate, nonetheless, you like the rate adequacy. So that's -- it's in that context, we say we continue to like to returns in those lines.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. And my follow-up, Alan, you continue to mention and show gauges of free cash flow. You also mentioned that it's -- I still don't think it's appreciated, at least I don't appreciate it, why it's important. So maybe you can try to further elaborate on is it -- is the increase in cash flows, which I assume is correlated with your increased growth. Is that actually aiding your ROE or what are we -- why should we be focusing more on free cash flow, which has a lot of moving parts in it.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. I wouldn't say it's just growth. It's a combination of profitable growth is what I would say about that. And as I've said, that I mean that's what gives us the flexibility to invest in all the important things we invest in, return capital to shareholders and grow the investment portfolio. So without strong free cash flow, we couldn't do those three things, and those are key to our operating model.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Thanks. First question, if I look at the underlying combined ratio on your Business Insurance it's, I believe, the best it's ever been since the St. Paul merger and public prior to that just on the numbers. I guess can you kind of talk a little bit about -- is that a sustainable kind of underlying combined ratio, underlying margin? Is there more improvement potentially can go there? At what point do you kind of say, okay, the margins we're seeing on the business are about as good as we should have and maybe more focus on growth and more expenses and other things. How do you balance that?\nAlan Schnitzer: It's a really good question. And as you can imagine, I'm going to resist the temptation to try to share too much on an outlook of that number or what we might want to do strategically. Everything you mentioned is something we can think about. And I really would like to get away from talking about the future of margins. But we've answered that question before with loss trend where it is and pricing where it is. So you can conclude that answer hasn't really changed. So I think I'm just going to leave it with we really like these margins. We really like the business we're putting on the books at the margin we're putting it on the books and we really like the opportunity ahead of us.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Brian, this is Greg. Just one follow-up. I would note you said you could grow the business. We are growing the business 16% on a full year basis and have strong new business. So there's a number of items that we watch and we compete in the marketplace, but growth is one of them through the lens of adequacy of our products.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. And on that note, as I've shared before, we -- it's a [indiscernible] in this industry to try to grow and compete on price. That's a losing proposition. We try to grow by making sure we've got the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell.\nBrian Meredith: Makes sense. Thanks. And then, Michael, I'm just curious, back on personal auto. When you look at your business, the majority right now being all on a written basis, what are you kind of thinking from a loss cost in place in perspective? And is that maybe why you're not stepping on growth maybe a little bit quicker right now because of uncertainty as far as the claim severity?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Brian. It's a great question. I would say that we continue to see loss trends moderate in personal auto but they remain at elevated levels. And so I guess I would describe our outlook as cautiously optimistic, and I would just say we're staying very disciplined, as I described earlier, with state-by-state execution, making sure we have our arms around written rate adequacy and then adjusting our marketplace actions in auto accordingly. And as I said, we're very pleased with the increase in new business production that we saw this quarter and policies in force stabilizing. And our plan is to continue down that path, achieve rate equity in additional states and for those non-rate actions as we go and see what that does to the top line as we move forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping for an update on what you're seeing in workers' compensation medical inflation. We've heard some comments about it moving back towards normalized levels and I'm wondering what Travelers experience is?\nDan Frey: Hey, Meyer. It's Dan. So sure, a couple of comments on that. We do see some paid medical severity. That's now higher than what we saw in the very benign pandemic levels. On the flip side of that, frequency has been pretty favorable. And as you know, we've shared a number of times previously, our view in reserving and in pricing still assumes that there's going to be a return to that higher longer-term trend. But when we factor all that in, in the most recent data that we're looking at, loss costs still coming in better than we expected, and that's why you get another quarter of favorable PYD.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Fantastic. And then switching gears, when we look at the, I guess, the premium data in Business Insurance, it looks like exposure and other components that are not rates accelerated in Select, but decelerated in middle market and property. And I was hoping you could talk us through that.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Hey, Meyer. This is Greg. We have a couple of dynamics going on between those two businesses. In Select, we have a higher exposure in workers' comp E&CMP (ph). And for workers' comp relative to middle market, I think that it's just a different cohort of customers. So in a wage increase environment on a smaller customer base, you get bigger deltas and so that's what's driving the difference in workers' comp. CMP, similar to what Michael said, that\u2019s our business owner product with a heavy property coverage that comes with it in. So we do have to think of it as an automatic inflationary level underneath the CMP product, so you get a little more exposure to growth there also. So those are the drivers underneath the difference between select and middle.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlex Scott: Hi. Good morning. First one I had is on Business Insurance. And I was just interested in hearing a little bit about the competitive dynamic in the market. I mean I look at the returns, how the underlying loss ratios are and so forth and the ROEs that suggests and yet price accelerating and in some areas, your business retention is actually hitting pretty darn high levels. So it also gets a lot of discipline in the marketplace. And just wanted to get your perspective on what is it in the environment that's causing everyone to remain so disciplined despite good underwriting and the additional contribution to net investment income.\nAlan Schnitzer: Alex, good morning. It's Alan. Let me start and then I'll turn it over to Greg to add anything I missed. But I would say, overall, you're correct. The pricing environment remains very strong and broad based by any historical standard or on any measure. And as you said, even with another quarter of very strong pricing, retention remains at historical highs. And I would say in broad strokes and there's really no change here from recent quarters. In broad strokes, I think there are two trends impacting pricing. On the one hand, there's just a lot of uncertainty out there in the world, and there's some headwinds. So the reinsurance market continues to be strong. You've got inflation of various varieties. You've got a tight labor market. I think weather is probably on everybody's minds, think about geopolitics these days, the world has never been more active than it is now and on and on. And so I can't speak for anybody else, but we're reacting to those things in our pricing. At the same time, we've had -- returns were in a much better place than they were a few years ago because we've done a pretty good job with pricing terms, conditions and all the rest. And so the pricing you see from us, and you referred to it as a competitive marketplace. I would say that it is a marketplace that is pretty disciplined. I suspect reacting to many of the things that we're reacting to. Greg, anything to add?\nGregory Toczydlowski: No, I think that's spot on.\nAlex Scott: Got it. The second one I had is on personal auto. Can you just give us maybe a high-level idea of what's going on with severity in the claims, and we can look a lot at used cars and that kind of thing, but some of the more new settlements around core repair and that kind of thing. Any color you can provide on some of those trends?\nMichael Klein: Yeah. Sure, Alex. It's Michael. Maybe just give a couple more comments relative to the comment I made earlier about moderating trends. You're right to point to sort of vehicle severity and used car prices, and we certainly see moderation there in the level of increase year-on-year. And in fact, when you look at the dynamics underneath the prior period adjustments that I described in the script, those really are driven by the physical damage coverages. Late last year, we were adding to our estimates for vehicle losses because physical damage coverages were rising more than we thought they were going to. And this year, we actually took down some of our estimates for vehicle severity on prior periods because they've been a bit more favorable than we anticipated. Broadly speaking, severity in auto is running mid to high0single digits, think closer to mid in the vehicle severity, think closer to high and bodily injury. And so that\u2019s sort of where trends are running today. We don\u2019t have a dramatic improvement in those trends sort of factored into our comments about when we\u2019re going to get to written adequacy state by state or those types of things, but that\u2019s a little bit more detail on sort of where things are running today. The other thing that we\u2019ve mentioned a couple of quarters throughout the year is we are also monitoring the mix of losses between vehicle loss and losses that have third-party property damage and bodily injury. We\u2019ve seen a bit of a mix shift towards more bodily injury claims, which is one of the things that has us keeping our severity trend estimates at that sort of elevated level.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: I want to follow directly on that, maybe similar thoughts about the home part of the business, Michael?\nMichael Klein: Sure. Just in terms of outlook for tends, Paul?\nPaul Newsome: Yes, please.\nMichael Klein: Yeah. So in property, again, the big driver of the improvement this quarter really was catastrophes and non-CAT weather. The non-CAT weather and I guess the non-weather loss dynamic that I would elaborate on is a lot of that non-CAT weather favorability and some of the non-weather loss favorability that we've commented on throughout 2023, really has been frequency driven. We do still see pretty healthy severity trends in the property space, offsetting some of that favorable frequency. Now again, we've had favorable results in the quarter. So the net is a good guy. But labor and some large loss pressure along with that favorable frequency is what's happening kind of underneath the loss levels in property.\nPaul Newsome: I'm just curious for some time, I think we've seen a little bit of a divergence between commercial auto and personal lines auto. Has that continued to be the case or are we seeing pretty similar claim trends in across sort of anything that drives?\nAlan Schnitzer: I think broadly, the claim trends are similar. I mean we see similar threads. It's obviously -- I mean that the exposures are different. The size of the vehicles are different. Mike, what else would you add.\nMichael Klein: Limits profile...\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. Limits profile were different.\nMichael Klein: Limits profile were different. Mix of vehicle versus bodily injury is different between Business Insurance and Personal Insurance, right, Greg?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yeah. I mean, one of the benefits, Paul, of having two large cohorts of auto business, commercial, auto, personal our product managers and actuaries spend a lot of time together and compare the trends. And for commercial, we'll have passenger -- private passenger light vehicles, think Vans of that sort. And then we'll have heavies, which aren't as relevant, but we spend a lot of time on the two cohorts that are private passenger like and the trends are very similar, both on a frequency and severity basis between the two portfolios.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. And that question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey. Great. I made the queue. Question -- most of my questions are answered. But in Bond & Specialty, the results looked exceptional. But in the context of renewal premium change, I'm very curious as to how pricing fared with regard to D&O and cyber in the quarter and what you're thinking in terms of those two lines going into 2024.\nJeffrey Klenk: Yeah, Andrew. This is Jeff Klink. So relative to D&O and cyber, public D&O pricing continues to be, I'd say, more pressured relative to the other liability lines. I would remind you that for public D&O and our management liability book, we're relatively underweight there, that's not been a major area of focus for us. On the cyber side, we continue to see some modest negative pricing there, I think, given some broader market perception on the returns in the line. Again, we feel really good about our execution there. We closely monitor our return profiles and are comfortable with our execution, both for those lines of business and management liability problem.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. Great. And along the same lines in Business Insurance with regard to workers' comp, I was wondering if you could put some numbers around that paid medical severity higher than the benign numbers you were seeing during the pandemic. I think that was in response to Meyer's question. And then the same question on the pricing of workers' comp. What are you thinking about going into 2024 as you proceed?\nDan Frey: Hey, Andrew. It's Dan. So I'll start and disappoint you on the work comp severity. So we're not going to put a number on it. But again, it's been benign. We've seen some of those numbers move up, but your starting point matters. So what you assumed medical severity was going to be inside of your overall loss pick. Pick really matters in terms of whether a move-up is problematic for you or not. And again, we saw more favorable reserve development this quarter. And then in terms of pricing, and I'll turn it to Greg. I think the returns in comp have continued to be good. So pure rate has continued to be slightly negative for us. We are getting strong exposure increases, Greg referenced in the select comments a few minutes ago, that's the poster child for where a lot of that exposure behaves like rate because it's the same worker just earning a higher wage and we're getting paid a higher price for it. The rating agencies, the bureaus are looking at their data on a lagging basis and until returns come under some pressure in work comp, we wouldn't be surprised to see this environment stay pretty steady.\nAndrew Kligerman: Perfect.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein for closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate your time. And as always, if there's any follow-up, please feel free to reach out. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you Abbe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. Core income of $454 million for the quarter benefited from very strong underlying underwriting results and net investment income, but was also impacted by elevated catastrophe losses and net unfavorable prior year reserve developments. Mike will provide more context on the catastrophe losses. The unfavorable prior year reserve development was driven by the results of our annual asbestos review in our run-off book. The reserves in the ongoing businesses of all three segments developed favorably.  We are very pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our business. Underlying underwriting income of $868 million pre-tax was up more than 40% over the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $9.7 billion and a consolidated underlying combined ratio which improved almost two points to an excellent 90.6%.  The underlying combined ratios in our commercial segments remained excellent. Our business insurance segment once again delivered very strong results with an underlying combined ratio of 89.7%. The underlying combined ratio on our bond and specialty business was also excellent at 80.7%.  Looking at the two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI/BSI underlying combined ratio was 88.3% for the quarter, among our best ever. In our personal insurance segment, the underlying combined ratio improved more than five points to 94.2% as the strong written rate from prior quarters is earning in. Our underlying results in personal insurance are improving and heading in the right direction. Turning to investments, our high quality investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well, generating after-tax net investment income of $640 million, reflecting strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and solid returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. In terms of production, thanks to great execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value they have to sell, we grew net written premiums by $1.3 billion or 14% to a record $10.5 billion. In business insurance, we grew net written premiums by 16% to $5.1 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was very strong at 12.9%, driven by renewal rate change which accelerated year-over-year and sequentially to 7.9%. Renewal rate change was higher sequentially in every line other than workers\u2019 comp, where overall renewal premium change remains positive and appropriate given return to the line. For the segment, even with higher pricing at record levels, retention remained very strong at 87%, a reflection of a rational market. New business was strong and higher broadly across the segment.  In bond and specialty insurance, we grew net written premiums to a record $1 billion, achieved 91% retention of our high quality management liability business, and grew net written premiums in our industry-leading surety business by 13%. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments.  In personal insurance, top line growth of 14% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 19.4% in our home owners and others business and increased to a record high 18.2% in our auto business. Another quarter of strong production across the board positions us well for the rest of the year and into 2024. We\u2019ll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. With the end of the year in sight and 2024 on the horizon and coming into focus, we feel very well positioned for what\u2019s ahead and quite confident. In our business insurance segment, written margins are expanding. Pricing has been strong and the components of core goods inflation that impact our loss costs are moderating. Medical inflation in particular remains benign; nonetheless, given the duration of relevant liabilities, we continue to incorporate medical inflation in our loss costs based on the higher longer term trends. In terms of the top line in business insurance, we\u2019re pleased that economic output and consumption so far remain robust given our leading workers\u2019 compensation business, we benefit in particular from the near 50-year low in unemployment, the prime age labor participation rate, which is at its highest level since 2007, and ongoing wage inflation, which contributes to premium growth and margins. As a result of strong pricing in recent years and higher fixed income NII, returns to the segment are currently attractive; nonetheless, given the uncertainty generally in terms of weather volatility, economic and social inflation, a hardening reinsurance market and the geopolitical landscape, we plan to continue pursuing strong price increases in both the property and casualty lines to achieve our over time return objectives. Turning to our industry-leading bond and specialty business, we just reached a milestone $1 billion in net written premiums and returns are terrific. As you\u2019ve heard, results in our personal insurance business are headed in the right direction. Earned margins are improving and additional price increases will earn-in from here. We\u2019re very pleased with our targeted marketplace execution at the same time inflationary pressures are moderating.  In terms of the investment portfolio, with interest rates at their highest levels in recent memory and most indications suggesting higher for longer, we are extremely well positioned. In the last five years, we\u2019ve grown our very high quality investment portfolio by nearly $19 billion, or about 25% to more than $90 billion. Ninety-three percent of the portfolio is allocated to fixed income. As we look ahead to 2024, we expect our after-tax fixed income NII will be more than $2.6 billion. To ensure that our competitive advantages continue to distinguish us and fuel our performance, we will continue to invest in our ambitious and focused innovation priorities. We\u2019re spending more than $1.5 billion this year on technology inside an excellent expense ratio and with a higher proportion allocated to strategic technology investments. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019re working on the right priorities, executing effectively, and that we\u2019ll see the benefits play out in growth and attractive returns going forward. Lastly, I\u2019ll share that we\u2019re recently back from one of the year\u2019s largest industry conferences, where we met with many of our distribution partners. We left confident that we have the pole position with distribution in the United States and that we\u2019re positioned to support each other\u2019s strategic and marketplace priorities. We\u2019re committed to being their best partner and to offering the products and services that best serve our mutual customers.  To sum it up, we remain very confident in the outlook for our business. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to my 30,000 colleagues who show up every day committed to our culture, to our standard of excellence, and of fulfilling our mission of creating shareholder value and our purpose of taking care of the people we\u2019re privileged to serve. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $454 million and core return on equity was 6.9% as heavy cat activity impacted our results. We\u2019re pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 90.6%, a 1.9 point improvement from last year\u2019s strong results. This combination of growth and underlying margin improvement led to a very strong underwriting gain of $684 million after tax, up $206 million or 43% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the third quarter improved 10 basis points from last year\u2019s quarter to an excellent 28% and continues to reflect the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency coupled with strong top line growth. Our third quarter results include $850 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses resulting from another quarter of both frequency and severity of weather across North America.  Turning to prior year reserve development, we had total net unfavorable development of $154 million pre-tax. In business insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $263 million was driven by charges in our run-off business, including $284 million related to our annual asbestos review as well as increased reserves for abuse and molestation resulting from the volume of claims related to the closing of the reviver window in California. This year\u2019s asbestos charge includes an additional increase to strengthen our carried reserve position relative to the range of outcomes. Outside of run-off in our ongoing businesses, business insurance had $132 million of net favorable PYD driven by favorability in workers\u2019 comp that was partially offset by unfavorability in commercial auto. In bond and specialty, net favorable PYD of $72 million was driven by another quarter of better than expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal insurance had $37 million of net favorable PYD driven by home owners and other. After tax net investment income of $640 million was up 27% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also above the prior year quarter. With interest rates having moved higher, we are again raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short term securities, to approximately $615 million after-tax for the fourth quarter. For 2024, we now expect more than $2.6 billion after-tax, our highest level ever, beginning with approximately $630 million in the first quarter of 2024 and growing to approximately $690 million for the fourth quarter. New money rates as of September 30 are about 180 basis points higher than what is embedded in the portfolio. Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of more than $3 billion were an all-time record. All our capital ratios were at or better than our target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion.  Interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, and as a result our net unrealized investment loss increased from $4.6 billion after tax at June 30 to $6.5 billion after tax at September 30. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.  Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $115.78 at quarter end, up 2% from year end and up 3% from a year ago. We returned $333 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $101 million and dividends of $232 million. We have approximately $6.1 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our board of directors. Similar to my comments on last quarter\u2019s call, the significant level of catastrophe losses we\u2019ve experienced this year have resulted in lower year-to-date earnings than we expected, so share repurchases in the fourth quarter will likely be lower than the quarterly share repurchases made in the first half of the year.  To sum things up, while our third quarter earnings were adversely impacted by elevated catastrophe losses, we\u2019re pleased to post another quarter of double-digit premium growth and improved and very strong underlying combined ratio, and further improvement in our outlook for fixed income NII, all of which bodes well for our business results going forward.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks Dan. Segment income for the third quarter was $468 million, with strong underlying underwriting and investment income, as well as favorable prior year development in our ongoing book offset by reserve charges in our run-off book mostly related to asbestos. We\u2019re particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 89.7% for the quarter, which was a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year and an all-time best third quarter result. The benefit of earned pricing was offset by normal variability in loss activity, all in netting to an excellent result.  Net written premiums increased 16% to a record third quarter of $5.1 billion driven by very strong renewal premium change of 12.9%, historically high retention of 87%, and new business of $695 million. Underneath RPC, as you heard from Alan, renewal rate change accelerated sequentially from the second quarter to 7.9% with all lines other than workers\u2019 comp being higher. We\u2019re thrilled with these production results and our fields\u2019 continued superior execution in the marketplace, and given our high quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and the improvements in terms and conditions, we\u2019re very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. Lastly, we\u2019re encouraged that new business was higher than the prior year quarter broadly across the segment. While the comparison of new business to the prior year quarter benefited from a relatively modest prior year result, as well as higher pricing on new business this year, we\u2019re also pleased with the impact that our strategic investments are having on our production results. As for the individual businesses, in select renewal premium change remains strong at 10.3%, while retention of 85% was up two points from the prior year quarter. New business was up $46 million from the prior year quarter driven in large part by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. We\u2019re also encouraged with the early performance of our new state-of-the-art commercial auto product, which has been rolled out in 12 states. In middle markets, renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.6%, while retention remained excellent at 89%. New business was a strong $352 million. We\u2019re pleased with the quality of the submission flow from our distribution partners during the quarter and our responsiveness in quoting and closing accounts that aligned with our appetite. As always, we remain vigilant around risk selection, underwriting and pricing. To sum up, business insurance had another terrific quarter. We\u2019re pleased with our execution in driving strong financial results while continuing to invest in the business for long term profitable growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Klenk: Thanks Greg. Bond and specialty posted terrific top and bottom line results for the quarter. Segment income was a record $265 million, up 10% from the very strong prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio was an outstanding 80.7%. Turning to the top line, we\u2019re pleased to have delivered record net written premiums of over $1 billion. In domestic management liability, we again delivered record level retention of 91%, up two points from the third quarter of 2022 while continuing to achieve positive renewal premium change. This result reflects the attractive returns of our high quality book of business. Record surety net written premiums reflect strong broad-based demand for surety bonds and higher premium for large construction projects. We\u2019re pleased to have once again delivered terrific top and bottom line results this quarter driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization, and the benefits from our value-added approach and market leading competitive advantages.  Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks Jeff, and good morning everyone. In personal insurance, the third quarter segment loss of $193 million was significantly impacted by catastrophe losses. We experienced elevated losses from weather activity specifically related to wind and hail events. This was another active quarter for severe convective storms across the U.S. There were 19 designated PCS events specifically related to wind, hail and tornado activity in the quarter, nearly twice the 10-year average and the highest number for a third quarter in more than a decade. On a more positive note, the underlying combined ratio of 94.2% improved 5.1 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting an improvement in both automobile and home owners. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 14%, driven by high teens renewal premium change in domestic automobile and home owners and other. In automobile, the third quarter combined ratio was 103.5%. This was 8.7 points lower than the prior year quarter, which included catastrophe losses resulting from Hurricane Ian. The underlying combined ratio of 100.6% improved 3.3 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in our results clearly reflects the growing impact of our pricing and non-rate actions. Underlying results in auto are headed in the right direction as the benefit of earned pricing continues to accelerate and as vehicle repair and replacement trends are moderating. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2023, it\u2019s important to remember that the fourth quarter auto underlying loss ratio has historically been six to seven points above the average for the first three quarters because of winter weather and holiday driving.  In home owners and other, the third quarter combined ratio of 116.2% increased 13.9 points due to the catastrophe losses that I mentioned earlier. The underlying combined ratio of 88% improved 6.9 points primarily due to the impact of earned pricing, a benefit from the favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year, and a lower expense ratio.  Turning to production, our results continue to demonstrate our disciplined market execution in a challenging marketplace. Beginning with domestic, home owners and other, renewal premium change of 19.4% was very strong. The lack of growth in policies in force reflects our continued actions to further balance rate adequacy, catastrophe risk, and regulatory risk. We expect renewal premium change in home owners to remain consistent through year end. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect renewal premium change to remain elevated but moderate into low double digits as our automatic increase in limits factors return to more normal levels, in line with stabilizing industry estimates of replacement costs.  In domestic automobile, renewal premium change of 18.2% increased two points compared to the second quarter of 2023. Auto policies in force declined slightly, reflecting our continued efforts to manage growth while improving profitability. Going forward, we expect renewal premium change in auto to remain very strong but begin to move down from here, as more of the book reaches rate adequacy on a written basis.  I\u2019m proud of the way our team continues to respond to the dynamic environment. We are consistently evolving pricing, segmentation, underwriting, and terms and conditions while managing new business flow to ensure we deploy capacity thoughtfully in the face of market dislocation. At the same time, we\u2019re sustaining our investments in capabilities to build our business for the future. With our leading talent, capabilities and strong distribution relationships, we are confident in our ability to generate leading returns over time. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks Michael, and Operator, we\u2019re ready to start questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Good morning everyone. I guess my first question will focus on business insurance. I think you guys have now reported something like 14 consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in the underlying combined ratio. I guess what I\u2019m--where I\u2019m going with this is just what is your longer term target with your UCR, especially in light of what we\u2019re seeing in the accelerating renewal rate trend, and maybe if you don\u2019t want to answer it that way, maybe you can triangulate for us just how the renewal rate change, which is accelerating, matches up with your inflation expectations and your insurance-to-value initiatives.\nAlan Schnitzer: A lot in that question, Greg - good morning, it\u2019s Alan. There\u2019s a lot in that question. I think you\u2019re right for starters - I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to give you our targets or objectives. I think it gets too close to something that\u2019s competitively sensitive in terms of our pricing strategies, but I guess I\u2019d point you toward where renewal premium change is, which is at record levels, and frankly I always hate to get into the commentary on loss trend because, as I\u2019ve shared before, to take a single metric to define what\u2019s going on across billions of dollars of premium implies a level of precision that doesn\u2019t exist - every line has got its own dynamics, so on and so forth. But there wasn\u2019t a lot of change in the profile of loss activity this past quarter, so we continue to have a pretty meaningful gap between where renewal premium change is and where loss trends are, and so I think that gives you a sense. It\u2019s why we are--it\u2019s why we are--it\u2019s easy enough in my prepared remarks to share that written margins are expanding.\nGreg Peters: Right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up question on the BI underlying loss ratio. Greg, you had said that the benefit of earned pricing was offset by normal variability in loss activity. I was wondering if you could just size those components, and it sounded like non-cat weather was maybe a little bit elevated relative to normal expectations, but wondering if you could just break that down for us.\nDan Frey: Hey David, it\u2019s Dan. I think we\u2019re not going to go any further. I think what Greg said is really the way to think about it, which is as Alan just mentioned, we\u2019ve been getting a good level of written price increase and that\u2019s earning its way through, so there is still definitely a benefit from earned pricing. In any given quarter, you\u2019ve got a handful of things that are going to go one way or the other - that could be small weather, that could be base year, it could be mix changes, it could be just variability from one quarter to the next. There were some good guys and some bad guys, nothing particularly significant in that result, just about offset the benefit from earned price, and again all inside of an underlying combined ratio that we\u2019re really happy with at sub-90.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to get more color on the reserve development you guys called out in your ongoing businesses within business insurance, if you could tell us what the workers\u2019 comp favorability, and then I think you called out commercial auto developed adversely. Could we get the numbers there, and then are there any other lines in your ongoing business that moved materially in the quarter?\nDan Frey: Yes Elyse, it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019ll disappoint you there - we\u2019re not going to do the line by line, but comp has been pretty strongly favorable. It was pretty strongly favorable again this quarter. In our remarks, we tried to call out the lines that had noteworthy movement this quarter. Commercial auto did have some noteworthy movement, it wasn\u2019t dramatic particularly in the scope of if you think about the size of the reserves for the commercial auto book. What we saw in commercial auto this quarter is a little bit of a lengthening of the development patterns, not a terrifically new theme but every quarter, we\u2019re looking at all the data that comes in. This gave us an indication that maybe reserves should be carried a little higher than we were, and we\u2019re just trying to react to that in real time as quickly as possible. There was some movement in the other lines, some good guys and some bad guys, nothing particularly noteworthy, but those were the two main drivers.\nElyse Greenspan: And then you guys--you know, you\u2019ve called out higher cats in the third quarter, as well as other quarters this year. As you guys contemplating making any changes to your reinsurance program heading into 2024, or how do you think changes you made over the past year could have led to higher cats this year?\nDan Frey: I don\u2019t think that the changes we\u2019ve made would have had much of a difference. Obviously the last few years, we\u2019ve had that underlying cat aggregate treaty. We didn\u2019t attach it at all in 2023, we didn\u2019t renew it in 2024.  We get that question a couple times - just to remind you, in 2023 when we had that underlying cat agg treaty, we placed--sorry, 2022, I\u2019m a year into the future already! So 2022, we didn\u2019t attach it, we didn\u2019t renew it in 2023. Even when we had it last time in \u201922, we placed about 50% of a $500 million layer, so it couldn\u2019t have been more than $250 million of recovery and it cost us a lot to have that policy - rate online was very high for that coverage.  We said at July 1 that we\u2019d enter into a new PI-specific coastal reinsurance treaty. I think we\u2019ll just continue to evaluate our position and what\u2019s available to us in the marketplace from a reinsurance perspective as we look forward to 2024, but I\u2019d say what we sort of regularly say, which is we\u2019re really pleased with our risk selection. We think we do a great job of segmentation and pricing. We\u2019re going to probably keep more net than many of our peers because at the end of the day, we like our underwriting.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. First question, just for Michael, in terms of home owners, that clearly seems like a line that probably needs more rate, not less, just given where cat trends have been. But you mentioned in your prepared remarks that we might see some premium growth deceleration because of what you referred to as automatic increase in limits. It sounded like that might have been about half of renewal premium growth. Can you just, I guess mechanically, help us understand a little bit more what that increase in limits is tied to, and in the absence of that, what are some other means by which you can get more pricing on that line?\nMichael Klein: Sure Ryan, thanks for the question. Just unpacking it for a second, right, so inside RPC in home owners, there\u2019s really two primary components: there\u2019s rate and then there\u2019s exposure or other RPC, which primarily is the additional premium we collect due to the coverage A limit, the dwelling limit on the home going up. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve increased coverage A amounts significantly to keep up with higher replacement cost trends that have been occurring, sort of across the industry, and given those outsized increases in coverage A amounts over the last couple of years, as we take a look at our external data and information about where replacement costs are today and where trends are, we are largely caught up with that increase, and so we don\u2019t see a need for coverage A amounts to move dramatically north from here in the near term, so that premium that we would--that we have been collecting because coverage As have been rising, won\u2019t be nearly as big an element of renewal premium change in \u201924 as it was in \u201922 and \u201923. That said, to your point, clearly the home owners line continues to need rate, it continues to need profit improvement, and we will continue to seek higher rate in home owners even though the limit increases will be subsiding.  The other thing I\u2019d point is part of the answer in home is pricing. Another big piece of the answer is non-rate actions, and we\u2019ve been very active in the marketplace across risk selection, peril-by-peril pricing, tighter eligibility, stricter terms and conditions to drive profit improvement in the property line as well.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. Then just a follow-up on business insurance retention - you know, it\u2019s interesting how robust that\u2019s been. Clearly we\u2019re seeing personal lines, retention come off as I would think you\u2019d expect when you\u2019re taking rate. What do you guys make of that, like why has retention been so robust, I guess despite so many rounds of rate increases?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Good morning Ryan, this is Greg. I think we start every month with retaining our high quality book of business, so it\u2019s been very much an intentional strategy of ours to make sure that we\u2019re being thoughtful on our terms and conditions, our pricing, and all the changes that we\u2019re making to continuously improve margins, but given the quality of that book, it\u2019s not a surprise for us. It also is an indicator of just how rational the marketplace is right now and the need for improved margins across the entire industry, based on all those headwinds that Alan talked about. We\u2019re not surprised by it, we\u2019re very pleased with it, and we\u2019re very focused on it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. First, just had a question on commercial auto, and if you could just give us a little bit more insight into what\u2019s driving the adverse development there. Some of your peers have seen that as well, and I think there is some concern that this could be the beginning of a trend, given what\u2019s gone on in personal auto over the past two years or so.\nDan Frey: Hey Jimmy, it\u2019s Dan again. Yes, as we said a little while ago, commercial auto is really just a modification based on the most recent data that\u2019s come in, in terms of the development of claims in commercial auto, particularly bodily injury claims. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve commented on and off probably over the last three or four quarters - numbers have been pretty modest, the themes are not inconsistent with what we anticipated, but you get a new set of data and the data looks a little bit different than your prior estimation, and so the magnitude of some of the changes that we anticipated is a little higher. Really, the focus of this most recent strengthening is the continued longer development of--or said inversely, the slower closing of claims in commercial auto, so as that continues to lag historical closure patterns, we\u2019re making an adjustment to reflect the most recent data.\nJimmy Bhullar: And that\u2019s just a function of repairs taking longer, or something else?\nDan Frey: This is more in the bodily injury side of commercial auto, so it\u2019s not so much repairs themselves, although that\u2019s been a factor in both Michael\u2019s business and, to a smaller degree, in Greg\u2019s business. Bodily injury, it\u2019s more the settlement of the injury claim.\nJimmy Bhullar: Then in personal auto, where are you in terms of rate adequacy on a written basis, and is--your discount has been sort of flattish, are your competitors being fairly rational and you\u2019re seeing price increases across the board or are there some companies that are not adjusting due to higher loss trend?\nMichael Klein: Thanks Jimmy, it\u2019s Michael. I would say that when you look at our--taking the second part of the question first, when you look at our production statistics, retention is down a bit but it\u2019s actually been pretty resilient in the face of the rate we\u2019ve been driving through the book, particularly given the magnitude of those numbers. I think that that\u2019s indicative of a fairly rational market and the fact that these are again industry-wide pressures that most competitors are dealing with. In terms of written rate adequacy, again last quarter I said we\u2019d get there in the coming quarters. Relative to the comments last quarter, we feel a little bit better sitting here today than we did 90 days ago, given the record level of RPC that we achieved in the third quarter and the fact that we\u2019re seeing loss trends stabilize, and that\u2019s coming through in our underlying combined ratio.  That said, I would also say that written rate adequacy still depends on the same list of things we talked about last quarter, right - it\u2019s the price we get, it\u2019s how quickly loss trends moderate and how much they continue to moderate, the regulatory process for getting rate approvals, and our actual loss experience. But it is at this point very much a state-by-state conversation, and we\u2019re working each state individually and adjusting our actions accordingly. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS Financial. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple ones here. First, let\u2019s let Jeff answer some questions here. Jeff, on the management liability business, I think you had mentioned in the quarter that there was some favorable current year development. Maybe you can quantify that and what\u2019s going on there with the management liability business that you\u2019re seeing this favorable development.\nDan Frey: Hey Brian, it\u2019s Dan. I think we\u2019re not going to put a number on it. It\u2019s not a significant deal. The only point Jeff was trying to make was sort of when you do the comparison year-over-year, there was some favorable CYPQ, which we called out last year in the third quarter. There was some favorable CYPQ this year as well, just not as much, so the year-over-year is unfavorable given less of a good guy.\nBrian Meredith: Got you, okay. That\u2019s helpful.  The next question, I\u2019m just curious, bigger picture in business insurance, exposure growth continues to be pretty healthy. Maybe you can give us a little context around what kind of drives that exposure growth? I would think that with the economy moderating some here, that that exposure growth would start to slow here.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes Brian, we watch for that all the time, and as you can see in the webcast, in the blue lines we give you, you can see it\u2019s been very stable across the select business and the middle market, and obviously those add to the total BI business. It really is a function of nominal GDP - you know, economic growth and overall inflation levels, and clearly we\u2019ve seen the consumer-type inflation correct somewhat from the peak of mid-2022. Where we\u2019re really encouraged, when we also look at our audit premium which is more of a going backwards view in our core middle market business, we continue to have real strong audit premium also, so both backwards and forward, we\u2019re encouraged with how exposure is playing out in the business and we\u2019ll continue to report out what we see with that line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, great. Good morning, guys.  First on business insurance segment, heard loud and clear the comments about written margins expanding. Does the definition of written margins include reserve changes, because I\u2019m just trying to--you know, when we look at the loss ratio, maybe I guess ex-cat, we clearly see that [indiscernible] that reserve releases or additions or whatever, right, are worse year-over-year, and clearly margins are good. I\u2019m just trying to--you know, does written margins mean--are you looking kind of forward-looking or backward-looking? Any color there? Thanks.\nDan Frey: Yes Mike, it\u2019s Dan. Just to clarify for you, so when we\u2019re talking about margin in that context, we\u2019re talking about the underlying combined ratio, so leaving to the side catastrophe losses and leaving to the side prior year reserve development. The only other comment I\u2019d make in that regard is when we do see changes in prior year development, we do roll forward our thinking in terms of does that impact our view of current year loss and go-forward loss, but PYD itself as its booked, whether it\u2019s favorable or unfavorable, is outside of that context when we\u2019re talking about underlying margins.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay, understood, and just a quick follow-up, then. Have you changed your view of forward-looking loss after this quarter, and you also called out the topping off of the asbestos and environmental--I think you used the word, topping off, but you kind of called out an additional add, and I don\u2019t know if you want to call out specifically what that dollar amount was. Thanks.\nDan Frey: Yes, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll split the asbestos charge beyond that, but what we wanted to get across was we did our sort of traditional deep dive in the third quarter, that resulted in a figure for which we would have strengthened the asbestos reserve. We chose also to, if you think about it in simple terms, as moving higher in the range of possible outcomes for asbestos, and so we\u2019ve put some money on top of what the analysis otherwise would have told you for the quarter. Then in terms of the first part of the question, we\u2019re looking at all the factors that go into loss trend every quarter, including favorable or unfavorable PYD. There are generally small puts and takes on a pretty regular basis, nothing terribly significant in this quarter in terms of our view of loss trend.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you and good morning. I guess my first question is on workers\u2019 comp. We saw a premium decline there year-over-year. Are there any one-time items there or is it just an indication of market conditions and maybe rate compression? Maybe you can tie that into how you\u2019re viewing this line of business and your thoughts about that into 2024.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes, good morning Yaron. I think you\u2019re referencing the slight down in the net written premium for the quarter. I would point you to year-to-date - it is just up 2%, so it wasn\u2019t a meaningful change for the particular quarter, and obviously where you\u2019re seeing not the level of net written premium growth on the other product lines that we\u2019re seeing in workers\u2019 comp, is clearly the rate pressure that the entire industry is seeing there. That rate pressure is driven based on the bureau\u2019s loss cost recommendations that continue to put minuses across the industry, and that\u2019s just an indication of the health of the line.  We\u2019re the largest workers\u2019 comp writer in the country, and on a calendar year basis we feel terrific about the results of that, and that\u2019s basically what\u2019s driving some of that net written premium change that you mentioned.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes Yaron, just to be clear, we feel great about the workers\u2019 comp line, we feel great about our results this quarter, this year, and we feel great about the outlook.\nYaron Kinar: Got it, thank you. Then my second question, also on BI, did you have any CYPQ there, because I did notice that the underlying loss ratio was flat year-over-year. Just given the rate commentary and RPC commentary, I would have thought maybe we\u2019d see a little bit of improvement there.\nDan Frey: Yes Yaron, it\u2019s Dan. A little earlier in the call and in Greg\u2019s comments, we called out that we did see some benefit from earned price, but half a dozen other things that would happen in any quarter, could be some good guys, could be some bad guys, could be mix, could be base year, could be non-cat weather, there were some favorable and some unfavorable that netted to a modest unfavorable to offset the pricing benefit, but nothing significant there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning, thanks for the call. I wanted to ask if you could help me think more about the cat load prospectively, and one of the things I was wondering about, and this may go to the definition of how you think about cat [indiscernible], is if inflation is effectively pushing losses that otherwise in the past would not have been cat losses, been in the cat designation, and that may be what--how much of that may be part of why the cat load may maybe go up. Just any thoughts on that would be great.\nDan Frey: Sure Paul, it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019ll start.  I think the second piece of the question, the answer would be yes to the degree that some of what we\u2019ve seen in higher cat losses is the impact of inflation over the last several years, and just the value of those claims going up. So yes, over time more things would fall into what would get designated as, quote-unquote, catastrophes, given the threshold.  Other than that, thinking about cats, we\u2019re looking at long term weather trends, medium term weather trends, near term weather trends. We\u2019re putting more weight on nearer term weather trends and, as both Greg and Michael have talked about, trying to react with very strong pricing, changes in terms and conditions, and risk selection where we think it\u2019s appropriate.  There is also clearly an uptick in catastrophe activity this year, so last year--I think last quarter, I think Alan maybe gave the statistic that in the 91 days of the quarter, there were 88 days in which there was a PCS event occurring. In the third quarter, there were 92 days in the quarter; on 91 of those 92 days, there was a PCS event occurring, so the increase in catastrophes is the combination of several factors: one is there do seem to be more storms more frequently; two, more people have moved into harm\u2019s way in terms of where the demographic spread of risk is; and three, inflation has resulted in the impact of those costs being higher. \nPaul Newsome: Is there any way to think about whether or not that would have an impact on the underlying combined ratio [indiscernible] the cat designation from the underlying?\nDan Frey: You know, Paul, sometimes we do see that in the quarter, where it\u2019s bucketing, where things will spill over into the cat number that would have otherwise been an underlying. That was not a big factor this quarter. It\u2019s not like there were a bunch of close calls that, because of inflation, spilled over into a cat designation. This was a significantly higher number of severe convective storms for a third quarter that created a bunch of catastrophes, so this was not a definitional bucketing close call issue. That does happen sometimes, but it didn\u2019t happen this quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ward from Citi. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ward: Thanks guys, good morning. I was curious about personal auto. Just wondering if there was an impact from current year reserves on the underlying result, and if you could maybe expand on the frequency and severity trends.\nMichael Klein: Sure Michael, it\u2019s Michael. You know, in terms of CYPQ, not a significant amount. I mean, we called out the earned impact of pricing - that really is the driver of the improvement in underlying, and then as respects frequency and severity, frequency largely coming in, in line with expectations. If you look at external indices, miles driven is up 2% to 3%, it\u2019s pretty consistent with the trend it\u2019s been on, and so not a lot to talk about on the frequency side. Then really, the moderating trends that I described are really coming from severity as we continue to see in particular physical damage severity moderate quarter over quarter over quarter as we go through 2023.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, and then on commercial property, just wondering how should we think about the impact of the growth on PI margins, and if there\u2019s more volatility in non-cat property, might that affect your growth appetite next year?\nDan Frey: Mike, it\u2019s Dan. I think we\u2019re very aware and cognizant of the amount of property that we\u2019re putting on the books, where we\u2019re putting it on the books, and what that\u2019s doing to our total exposures. We price property with a risk load, given the uncertainty and variability that can come with it. In terms of the margin from how much property you\u2019re writing, there can be a mix change over time if you think about the relative loss ratios of the lines, and some of that\u2019s driven by the duration of the liability in the lines. Property historically tends to run a lower underlying loss ratio than, for example, workers\u2019 comp, so you could get a mix change over time.  Tell me if that\u2019s not responsive to your question.\nMichael Klein: The one thing I\u2019d add to that also is when you look at our property growth, the thrust of that growth really is being driven based on rate and exposure change. Clearly, we\u2019re being active and very selective on the new business front, but when you look at what\u2019s driving the net written premium change, it does start with rate and exposure change.\nAlan Schnitzer: And strong retention.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thanks. A question to start for Jeff. We\u2019ve seen G&A expenses rise significantly faster than written premium every quarter this year, and I was hoping you could talk to what\u2019s going on there.\nJeff Klenk: Yes, absolutely. This is Jeff - thanks Meyer. The question on expenses is we\u2019re definitely making strategic investments to support our future success. I think broadly speaking, I\u2019d give you two buckets: it\u2019s employees and it\u2019s also technology investments and tech platform, but I\u2019d remind you, all in the context of while we\u2019re delivering [indiscernible] returns.\nMeyer Shields: Yes, that\u2019s fair. Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful. Second question, and I\u2019m obviously shooting a little bit in the dark, but it looks like last year and this year, the run rate of workers\u2019 compensation reserve releases was a lot higher than preceding years. I was hoping you could talk through what that change is - is it just COVID-related frequency benefit, or are there other factors?\nDan Frey: Hey Meyer, it\u2019s Dan. You know, comp has been pretty consistently for a number of years a pretty favorable development story, and when it is, it\u2019s across a number of accident years. That\u2019s continued to be the case in 2022 and 2023. We\u2019re really just reacting to--you know, we\u2019ve had this conversation before, you\u2019ve got to be really careful with your assumption around medical cost trend, given the duration of the liability. A quarter goes by, a bunch of claims close, you see what actually happened in terms of severity relative to what you had previously allowed for, and you make an adjustment. We\u2019re really just following the numbers in that regard. We\u2019ve certainly not become any more aggressive in the way we\u2019re reserving for workers\u2019 comp, it\u2019s just the mathematical output of the changes that we\u2019ve seen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: Hey, good morning. First one I have for you is on casualty, and specifically I wanted to ask you about some of the comments that have come out of the larger reinsurance companies. I mean, it sounds like they\u2019ve gotten a bit more cautious in their stance on U.S. casualty in general, and I guess the social inflation trends and so forth. Certainly you guys sound like you saw a little bit of that in general liability in commercial lines, but I just wanted to see if you could provide perspective on how big of an issue do you really think that is for the industry at this point, and is there anything unique about your exposure that sort of insulates you, whether it\u2019s the size of business that you tend to write and that kind of thing. \nAlan Schnitzer: Yes Alex, it\u2019s Alan. We think that commentary is well placed and, frankly, we\u2019ve been on that bandwagon since, I don\u2019t know, 2018 or something like that. We think we rang that bell very, very early. We think we\u2019ve reacted to it consistently, even during the pandemic when you might have looked at the data and thought that things were improving. We\u2019ve said consistently, we don\u2019t believe it. We think it\u2019s here, we think it\u2019s at higher levels, we think it\u2019s inflating faster. What we\u2019ve seen is inside the underlying--the combined ratios that we\u2019re reporting in business insurance, so we do think that it continues to be an important issue to watch. We\u2019ve taken a lot of price in part in response to that, so it\u2019s an issue and we think we\u2019re on top of it.\nAlex Scott: Got it, thank you. The follow-up I had is on the auto insurance specifically. You obviously showed a good amount of improvement, which is great to see. How much of that is driven by the severity beginning to calm down, or stabilizing at least? Any color you can provide on those trends, and maybe specifically even repair and what you\u2019re seeing there?\nMichael Klein: Sure Alex, it\u2019s Michael. I\u2019ll just clarify a couple of things I said earlier.  It really is the acceleration of earned pricing, earning through and driving that underlying improvement. But when you think about the external trends and external costs, it definitely is also a result of those external trends moderating. We had been talking about double-digit loss cost trends particularly in the physical damage space for quarter upon quarter upon quarter. Those trends moved into the single digits this quarter, so it was really both the earned pricing and the moderating trends driving that improvement.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Heleniak: Yes, good morning. Just wondering if you could comment on the recent proposed reforms in the State of California, really to keep private insurers in the state from leaving the state. Do you think that the initiatives there are appropriate? Do you think they\u2019re enough, and does that impact your strategy there either way, in either direction? Just any overall kind of first views on some of the proposals out there.\nMichael Klein: Sure Scott, it\u2019s Michael. I\u2019ll share a couple of thoughts. First of all, the idea of regulatory reform in California is positive news. That said, I really don\u2019t think there are enough details available to evaluate. You\u2019ve got a framework that the governor has asked the commissioner to take action on, but the details underneath that framework and how it\u2019s going to be implemented have yet to be defined, and so deciding whether it\u2019s a net positive or not and what actions to take as a result, there just really aren\u2019t enough details yet to evaluate that further. But we certainly are encouraged by the fact that California is considering regulatory reform, and we think it\u2019s long overdue.\nScott Heleniak: Okay, understood. Thanks.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.\nBob Huang: Thank you. Most of my questions were answered, but maybe just one thing. You mentioned on the prepared remarks about tech investments. Can you possibly unpack that a little bit - what are the key technological aspects that you\u2019re focusing on in terms of the investment? I\u2019m assuming cloud is always going to be a big part of your investment, just given that it is a consumption-based expense model, but are there other IT capabilities that you would like to call out?\nAlan Schnitzer: Bob, good morning, it\u2019s Alan. Thank you for the question. We would be really happy to take this offline with you. We\u2019ve talked really extensively about this over a long period of time, but broadly, the investments that we\u2019re making across the organization fall into three buckets: one, extending our lead in risk expertise; two, providing great experiences to our customers, agents, brokers and employees; and three, optimizing productivity and efficiency. That happens in a lot of different ways at the enterprise level and it happens segment by segment. At the enterprise, broadly speaking it\u2019s digitizing the value chain, digitizing the customer journey, modernizing the foundation, advanced analytics, automation, faster speed to market, getting the right price on the risk, things like that. In terms of what\u2019s going on in the businesses, it\u2019s partner integration, sales and service, better front end for customers. It\u2019s on and on. It is--it\u2019s focused and it\u2019s ambitious, but it also covers a lot of ground. We\u2019ve talked a lot about it extensively and we\u2019d be happy to meet with you and share more.\nBob Huang: Okay, thank you for that. Maybe just a follow-up on worker\u2019s comp, and apologies for belaboring the point on this, is it possible to maybe unpack a little bit in terms of how the loss ratio looked like for workers\u2019 comp versus other parts of business insurance? I\u2019m assuming this does not impact your loss cost trend of 5.5% to 6%, but just curious if you can give a little bit of details there.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, we\u2019re not going to break out the losses by product line, but it certainly is wrapped in the overall number that we\u2019ve talked about historically.\nBob Huang: Okay, thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ms. Abbe Goldstein, I will turn the call back over to you.\nAbbe Goldstein: Great, thanks everyone. We appreciate you joining us today for our call, and as usual, if there\u2019s any follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 2, "year": 2023, "date": "2023-07-20 12:50:03", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Second Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 20, 2023. At this time. I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein; Senior Vice-President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2023 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey; CFO; and our three segment Presidents Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties, and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today In the face of an historic cat quarter, our top and bottom line results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the resilience of our business model. This quarter, we reported strong underlying results and investment returns, as well as, net favorable prior-year reserve development, which were essentially offset by an historic level of industry-wide catastrophe losses. There were PCS designated catastrophe events taking place on 88 of the 91 days of the quarter. Despite pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.5 billion, we generated slightly positive core income for the quarter. We are very pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our business. Pre-tax underlying underwriting income of $781 million for the quarter was up nearly 40% driven by record net earned premiums of $9.2 billion, and a consolidated underlying combined ratio, which improved 1.7 points to an excellent 91.1%. Earned premiums were higher in all three of our business segments. Underlying profitability in our Business Insurance segment was particularly strong. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points to an excellent 89.4%. The underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business was higher year-over-year, but at 87.8%, still generated a very attractive return. In our Personal Insurance segment, the underlying combined ratio improved by 2 points, reflecting the actions we've taken to improve profitability. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $594 million after-tax for the quarter, reflecting stronger and reliable returns from our fixed-income portfolio and solid returns from our non-fixed-income portfolio. Given our confidence in the strength of our business, we returned $633 million of excess capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $400 million of share repurchases. Turning to production. Thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field, we grew net written premiums by $1.3 billion or 14% to a record $10.3 billion. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 18% to $5.2 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was a record-high at 12.8%, driven by renewal rate change, which accelerated 2.5 points sequentially to 7.2%. The renewal premium change we achieved this quarter was broad-based. RPC was double-digit or near double-digit in every line, other than workers' compensation, and it was higher sequentially in every line, including workers' compensation. Even with strong pricing retention, an important indicator of marketplace stability, remained very strong at 88%. New business increased 36% to $671 million, led by the property line. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, record net written premiums were about even with the prior-year quarter. Retention in our management liability business was an excellent 91%, and new business increased 11%. Surety net written premiums were also once again strong. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. The growth we're putting on the books is from geographies, products and distribution partners that we know well. In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 19.2% in our Homeowners and Other business, and increased to a record high 16.1% in our auto business. Another quarter of terrific production across the board positions us well for the rest of the year and into 2024. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to spend a few minutes on what Travelers is doing in an important area for us, artificial intelligence. We subscribe to the view that over time the impact of AI across the economy is going to be profound, so is the opportunity for Travelers. With our performance transformed mindset and our disciplined framework for assessing our investment priorities, we've been focused for years on responsibly developing differentiating AI capabilities across our three innovation priorities, extending our lead in risk expertise, providing great experiences for our customers, agents, brokers, and employees, and optimizing productivity and efficiency. Between our colleagues who are dedicated to AI specifically and others in enabling disciplines, we have a very significant number of our employees engaged on the objective of making sure that we're leading when it comes to AI. As we've shared before and as you can see on Slide 23 of the webcast presentation, for some time, we've been steadily increasing our technology spend. This year, we'll spend more than $1.5 billion on technology. As this slide demonstrates, we've also been improving the strategic mix of our tech spend. That includes a meaningful increase in investments to develop require cutting-edge AI capabilities built on modern cloud technology. Importantly, we've done all that while significantly improving our expense ratio. In no small part, thanks to the success of our technology investments. The quantity and quality of data are key differentiators when it comes to AI. For more than a decade, we've been investing in datasets, data quality and data accessibility. Between submissions in our commercial businesses and quotes in PI, we intake millions of business opportunities each year. We also take and adjust and adjudicate millions of claims. As one of the largest risk control organizations in the industry, we provide risk mitigation to our commercial customers, completing more than 100,000 risk control consultations annually. We capture valuable data from virtually all of those interactions. Our data also include decades of curated institutional knowledge in the forms of policies, procedures, guidelines, forensic investigations and so on. All of that creates an excellent foundation for the next iteration of generative AI. In addition to our extensive proprietary data, we've been assembling actionable third-party data for years. In fact, we have more than 2,000 datasets from hundreds of third-parties. All-in, we believe that we have a significant and hard-to-replicate data advantage. Given the competitive advantages that will come from deploying AI across the insurance value chain and the expertise, resources and data required to get there, scale will increasingly be a differentiator in our industry, as well the ability to execute complex initiatives effectively and efficiently. Expertise, resources, data, scale and execution excellence, all favor Travelers. The potential use cases for AI in our industry are many and varied. We pursue very focused opportunities that are consistent with our innovation priorities and will create meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages, all with an eye towards leveraging strategic capabilities across our organization. AI capabilities that we currently have in production span the spectrum from those driving efficiency through automation, to more advanced generative AI and large language models. More advanced models augment various aspects of our underwriting, claim handling, service delivery and other work. We use intelligent process automation broadly throughout our business to handle hundreds of routine workflows. Automation and AI have been meaningful drivers of our expense ratio improvement over the past seven years or so. The key success driver in insurance is segmenting risk as finely as possible, to achieve pricing that is accurately calibrated to the risk. Deep learning models have significantly improved our ability to classify it in segment risk in our flow businesses. For example, in Personal Insurance, we leverage proprietary AI and aerial imagery to assess roof and other site-related conditions at the parcel level. Parcel level risk assessment at scale was practically unimaginable to several years ago. And that type of information is very difficult to obtain from the insured with a reliable degree of accuracy. In our Select Accounts business, we estimate that AI has improved business classification, a critical underwriting input by more than 30%. In our Middle Market business, we've developed a suite of sophisticated AI models, which facilitate targeted cross-selling, supporting our effort to sell more products to more customers. We're also using AI to better understand our customers and their needs. So this improved customer segmentation, we can better align new product development and generate insights that improve the customer experience. Enhancing our industry-leading analytics using machine learning models to deliver sophisticated actuarial insights into loss cost trends and development, which improve our already strong pricing and product monitoring capabilities. On the most advanced end, we're leveraging generative AI in large language models, and we've been doing so for several years. For example, in our Bond & Specialty business, our proprietary large language models have processed hundreds of thousands of broker submissions as we work toward improving intake time from hours to minutes. This will improve our responsiveness to our customers and distribution partners, and contribute to our productivity. In our claim organization, our proprietary large language model ingest legal complaints filed against our insureds and then highlights key liability and coverage issues, assists in routing the cases to the best-suited defense counsel, and provides risk-related insights that can be incorporated back into our underwriting process. We've also developed and are piloting a Travelers claim knowledge assistant, a generative AI tool trained on many thousands of pages of proprietary technical source material that was previously only accessible to thousands of different documents. The model provides claim professionals with the ability to easily access accurate actionable information on technical and procedural claim matters, increasing speed, accuracy, and consistency in various workflows, including in interactions with our customers and distribution partners. So in terms of AI, we're investing with speed and strategic direction, consistent with our stated objective of delivering industry-leading returns. I've only shared some of what's in-flight, and the capabilities that we've developed are in various phases of adoption. The full impact of the capabilities we're developing, and others on our roadmap are still ahead of us. To sum things up, we are very confident in the outlook for our business. We have terrific underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses, improving underlying results in our personal insurance business, and steadily rising investment returns in our fixed-income portfolio. As you've heard, we're also investing in impactful new capabilities to advance our ambitious innovation agenda. With that momentum and the best talent in the industry, we are well-positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. We're pleased to have generated record levels of earned premium this quarter, and an underlying combined ratio of 91.1%, a 170-basis point improvement from last year's strong results. This led to a very strong underlying underwriting gain of $615 million after-tax, up $171 million or 39% from the prior-year quarter. The expense ratio for the second quarter improved 40 basis points from last year to 28.6%, once again, benefiting from the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency coupled with strong top line growth. As Alan mentioned, the industry experienced a very active cat quarter and our second quarter results include $1.5 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses, our second largest ever cat amount for a second quarter. As disclosed in the significant events table and our 10-Q, we had six events surpass the $100 million mark in Q2, the most ever for a single quarter since we began disclosing the table in 2013. Turning to prior-year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $60 million pre-tax. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $101 million was the result of better-than-expected loss experienced in workers' comp across a number of accident years being more than offset by an increase in some of our other casualty reserves, as well as, for run-off operations. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $119 million was driven by better-than-expected results in management liability and surety. Personal Insurance at $42 million of net favorable PYD, driven by Homeowners and Other. After-tax net investment income of $594 million was in line with the prior-year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields, and higher invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed-income portfolio were solid, but as expected, we're not as strong as the double-digit yield we experienced in the prior-year quarter. With interest rates having moved higher during the second quarter, we are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities by $35 million after tax for the back half of the year. We now expect approximately $570 million after tax in the third quarter and $595 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30th are about 140 basis points higher than what's embedded in the portfolio, so fixed income NII should continue to improve as the portfolio gradually turns over and continues to grow. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.5 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. In late May, we issued $750 million of 30-year debt in order to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio in line with our target range as our premium volume has continued to grow. Interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.9 billion after tax at March 31st to $4.6 billion after tax at June 30th. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed-income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed-income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $115.45 at quarter-end, up 1% from year-end and up 3% from a year ago. We returned $633 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $233 million. We have approximately $6.2 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Since the significant level of cat losses in late June resulted in lower earnings for the quarter than we had anticipated, we expect the level of share repurchases over the back half of the year to be lower than the level of share repurchases in the first half of the year. Turning to the topic of reinsurance, Page 20 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1st reinsurance placements. While we did see some meaningful price increases on our reinsurance renewals, those increases were broadly in line with the price increases we are obtaining on the direct property premiums we're writing. So there's little or no impact expected on margins. We take another moment to highlight a few items on Page 20. First, we renewed our main cat reinsurance program at terms that were generally consistent with the expiring program. Second, we increased the coverage under our Northeast Property treaty by fully placing the $850 million layer above the attachment point of $2.5 billion. A year ago, we placed $750 million of that $850 million layer and the attachment point was $2.25 billion. This treaty remains pretty far out on the tail for us. Finally, as part of our ongoing management of tail risk exposure for the enterprise and in response to inflation-driven growth in insured values in our Personal Insurance property book, we added a new hurricane cat excess of loss reinsurance program, specific to Personal Insurance coastal exposure, providing 50% coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $1.75 billion, again far out on the tail. Any margin impact from this new program will be de minimis, given both the size of our PI property book and the level of price increases we are obtaining on that book. To sum up the quarter, our ability to absorb $1.5 billion of pre-tax cat losses and still report slightly positive core income for the quarter is a testament to the overall strength of our franchise, and the underlying fundamentals of our business. Q2 was another quarter of double-digit premium growth, improved underlying profitability, and further improvement in our outlook for fixed-income NII, all of which bodes well for our future returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $402 million of segment income for the second quarter, down from the prior-year quarter, driven by prior-year reserve development and higher cats, as Dan mentioned. Underlying underwriting results continue to be exceptional, with the underlying underwriting income up more than 50% from the prior-year quarter. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's underlying combined ratio of 89.4%, which improved by three points from the prior-year quarter. The loss ratio benefited from property losses that were about a 1.5 points better than our expectations for the current year quarter. The loss ratio also improved due to earned pricing. The expense ratio remained strong at 30.1%. Net written premiums increased 18% to a quarterly record of $5.2 billion, driven by renewal premium change of 12.8%, retention of 88% and new business of $671 million, all record highs. Underneath RPC, renewal rate change accelerated sequentially from the first quarter by 2.5 points to 7.2%. We're thrilled with these production results and the superior execution by our field team in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased with our response to the persistent environmental headwinds in both the property and liability lines. In each of our product lines, renewal premium change was higher than the first quarter. And beyond pricing, we continue to improve terms and conditions to ensure we're achieving an appropriate risk-reward trade-off on the business we write. As we always say, we execute in a granular manner, deal-by-deal, class-by-class. Into that point, we're thrilled with our execution. Demonstrated by record retention of 88% on our very-high quality book of business and rate that is thoughtfully segmented by return profile. New business, as a percentage of the book, returned to pre-pandemic levels, led by the property line. We're pleased with new business dollars at an all-time high. And as always, when it comes to new business, we remain focused on risk selection, underwriting terms and conditions, and pricing. We're also very pleased with the impact that our strategic investments are having on our production results. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change was up 1 point from the first quarter to a strong 10.6%, while retention also remained historically high at 84%. New business increased $30 million or 28% from the prior-year quarter, driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In Middle Market, renewal premium change was up more than 2 points sequentially from the first quarter to a historically high 10.5% with renewal rate change increasing sequentially by 1.5 point to 5.9% and continued strong exposure growth. Retention was once again exceptional at 90%, while new business was up 32% from the prior-year quarter, with increases across all account sizes in most markets. To sum up, Business Insurance had another strong quarter and continued to execute on the fundamentals to drive profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted strong top and bottom line results for the quarter. Segment income of $230 million was up slightly from the very strong prior-year quarter. The combined ratio was a terrific 77.1%. The underlying combined ratio was a solid 87.8% for the quarter. A small number of surety losses drove the roughly 4 point increase in the underlying loss ratio year-over-year. As we've said before, surety losses can be a bit lumpy. Even with the incremental losses this quarter, our returns in the surety line remain excellent. Turning to the top line, we delivered record net written premiums this quarter. In domestic management liability, we are pleased that we drove record retention of 91% in the quarter, up 2 points sequentially and 3 points from the second quarter of 2022, while continuing to achieve solid renewal premium change. This result reflects our team's deliberate execution to retain our high-quality book of business in light of the very strong returns. We're also pleased that we increased new business 11% from the prior-year quarter. That's a reflection of the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners, and a lot of hard work by our team in the field. Additionally, we are pleased to report record surety net written premiums in the quarter. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were once again strong this quarter driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization, and the benefits from our ongoing strategic investments to extend our market-leading competitive advantages. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone In Personal Insurance, the second quarter segment loss of $538 million and a combined ratio of 122% were significantly impacted by catastrophes. While it's not unusual for us to have a loss in the second quarter given it's typically the quarter with the highest weather-related losses, catastrophe losses this quarter for both us and the industry were significantly elevated compared to historical results. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 13%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both Domestic Automobile and Homeowners and Other. The underlying combined ratio of 94.1% improved 2 points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting an improvement in the underlying combined ratio in Homeowners and Other, partially offset by an increase in Automobile. In Automobile, the second quarter combined ratio was 108.4% with an underlying combined ratio of 103.5%. The underlying combined ratio increased 1.7 points from the prior-year quarter due to higher severity, driven by increased vehicle replacement and repair costs and a mix-shift from collision-only claims for its claims with bodily injury and third-party property damage, which is more consistent with more cars on the road leading to more multi-car accidents. These increases were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing and a lower expense ratio. While some of the inflationary pressures in auto are beginning to show signs of easing, they are not improving at the rate we expected. Consequently, we're not yet achieving the written rate adequacy levels, we had anticipated. While we continue to make progress and expect to get there in the coming quarters, exactly when will depend on a few things. For example, how quickly inflation comes down, how quickly we can get additional rate through the regulatory process and our actual loss experience. In Homeowners and Other, the second quarter combined ratio of 135.1%, increased 17.1 points, due to significantly higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.2% improved 5.1 points, primarily driven by non-cat weather losses that were lower than in the prior-year quarter. Non-cat weather losses in the quarter were also better than our expectation, as more events reached our catastrophe threshold. Turning to production, our results continue to demonstrate disciplined market execution of rate and non-rate actions in both lines as we remain focused on improving profitability and managing growth in response to continued inflationary pressures in the environment. In Domestic Automobile, renewal premium change of 16.1% increased 2.1 points from the first quarter of 2023. We expect renewal premium change to continue to increase from current levels throughout the second half of this year. In Domestic Homeowners and Other, renewal premium change of 19.2% was broadly consistent with the first quarter. We expect renewal premium change to remain in the high-teens through the end of the year. Before I conclude, I just want to take a minute to thank our claim partners for responding to our customers when it matters most. Behind the aggregate statistics of catastrophe events occurring virtually every day of the quarter, our tens of thousands of individual customers whose homes and vehicles are damaged or destroyed and whose lives are disrupted. In each case, our claim team is responding, helping those customers get their homes repaired and their cars back on the road, continuing to deliver high-quality customer service despite the high volume of clients. Both the loss environment and the personal insurance marketplace remain dynamic. We continue to respond to the changing environment with a steadfast focus on execution quickly addressing changes in loss experience with targeted pricing, underwriting and other non-rate actions, remaining disciplined in writing business that is consistent with our appetite and making thoughtful and impactful investments for the future. We're confident that the actions we've taken and we'll continue to take will improve profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond. Now, I will turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael. We're ready to open up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGreg Peters: Well, good morning, everyone. I guess, notwithstanding on Michael's comments, I - just curious about if there's going to be any shift in the strategy on property considering what's going on with catastrophe losses. And I'm also trying to triangulate or bridge the difference between personal lines, which clearly was a negative surprise, and I think, Greg, in your comments you said property actually was a better net gain for you guys relative to expectations. So any broad comments on your views on property in light of the cats and in the different segments too, please?\nMichael Klein: Sure. So I can start on the property side, Greg. Certainly, the catastrophe experience in the quarter was significantly worse than prior year and n worse than our expectations. In terms of our shift in strategy, what I would say is we continue to execute a series of actions in the property line to manage growth and improve profitability. And again, first and foremost, you see that in the pricing and the production statistics that we shared with you on the webcast. But beyond that, we're managing terms and conditions, think deductibles, think roof age eligibility, think coverage levels on roof replacement, and a variety of actions that we look at very granularly state by state, market by market, account by account. And then one of the other things we're really encouraged by, Alan had mentioned in his discussion around artificial intelligence, is our aerial imagery and artificial intelligence-enabled capability we have there to refine our underwriting and our risk selection. So less the shift in strategy and more a continuation of a really broad array of profit management and profit improvement efforts in the personal lines property space.\nGregToczydlowski: Hi, Greg. This is Greg. Just to follow-up on the commercial side, and so many times the catastrophes - the split between personal and commercial can be - really depends on the concentration of where the catastrophes hit in terms of where commercial businesses are. In terms of your comment, I think you referenced in my prepared comments, when I was explaining the underlying combined ratio, and I mentioned that property was better than expectation, and that really was non-cat property.\nGreg Peters: Got it. All right. Thank you for the answers. And then, I guess, I'll pivot, Greg, also during your comments, you talked about reserve development. Maybe spend a minute - don't really touch upon workers' comp, but the adverse development in the other lines.\nDan Frey: Hi, Greg, it's Dan Frey. I'll take the PYD comments. So in the quarter for Business Insurance, as we said, overall unfavorable $101 million. Comp continues to be favorable. The comp favorable was very strong this quarter, more than $250 million of good news. So that leaves us with the other liability lines including run-off being unfavorable. And that's really led by umbrella, which is sort of the poster child for perpetual core levels of inflation just compounding and pushing more claims up into the umbrella layer. But a couple of things to put - to put that in context, I guess, we're making a relatively small adjustment to those liability lines, given the fact that there are more than $15 billion worth of reserves in those lines. The returns in BI continue to remain excellent. And across the company, I'd just remind us, including the good news coming out of Bond & Specialty, which is also liability type coverage, we had a net favorable of $60 million for the quarter.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had just a follow-up question just on the adverse prior-year development. I guess, what does that do to your view of future loss cost trends? It sounds like some of it is run-off, but also some of it is more business that you're obviously still writing. So I'd be interested in how you've changed your 5.5% to 6% loss trend assumptions.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, David, good morning. It's Alan. Thank you. Two things in response to that. One, I would say that - I would just point you to the combined ratio and underlying combined in BI in the quarter, and obviously, we think about how prior-year development influences that through - base your changes and you can see a pretty solid results. And as we've shared with you before, I always - I always want to just preface this by saying, it's a very blunt instrument to try to capture what's going on across billions of dollars of premiums in a single loss trend metric. Every line has its own dynamics, and the question usually comes in, in terms of loss trend, but, of course, there is base year changes, there's exposure changes, there's other adjustments to loss activity. So always puts and takes in all those - in all those measures. But all-in, I'd say there really hasn't been much significant change. And I would go back to a comment that Dan made, on $15-odd billion of reserves, this is a relatively small adjustment. And we're always every quarter looking at all our reserves, and sometimes they go up, sometimes they go down, but relatively small. And as Dan said, the returns in BI continue to be exceptional.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And then I guess, I should just take that. I mean, it's obviously a very fluid environment. But I guess, it would - fluid macroenvironment. It would seem that just given the re-acceleration in renewal rate change, the gap between written rate and loss trend has been expanding. I guess, is that the right take? Or is there anything else that I'm missing there? Obviously, we have to take catastrophes into account, but there - I know Fidelis has come in. I'm just wondering if there's anything else I'm missing on the underlying loss ratio.\nAlan Schnitzer: No, I mean other than - Greg mentioned in the script that the non - the non-cat property losses came in a little better than we thought. But for the most part, I think the way you slice it up is about right.\nDan Frey: Yes. And David, it's Dan. I'll just - you mentioned Fidelis, I mean, we said at the beginning of the year that Fidelis was not going to be big enough to have a meaningful impact on the underlying combined ratio, and that's still the case including Q2.\nAlan Schnitzer: I think you got it right, David.\nDavid Motemaden: Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: Hi, thanks. Good morning. So, yes, Alan, I hear you that you've got $15 billion reserves, sometimes they go up, sometimes they go down. But I guess, I'd say, they don't usually go up quite as much in a given quarter, especially when there is so much workers' comp reserve releases, and I mean, there's also like a pretty sharp acceleration of pricing. So it does look from the outside like - I don't know maybe you guys are seeing something new or you've identified something from a trend perspective. I guess, just if anything, in this review, I guess, what have you learned this year that, I guess, you might not have known a year ago?\nAlan Schnitzer: Let me start, Ryan, and I will turn it over to Dan. But we're squaring triangles, and we're doing - we're applying actuarial analytics to a series of triangles and historical losses, and that's really how we're coming up with this. I mean, the overwhelming thing that all of us are looking at is higher levels of economic inflation. And so that - you know, that is no doubt a contributor here.\nDan Frey: Yes, Ryan. The only thing, I think, I'd add to Alan's comments, which I agree with. We've said, as people have asked over the last several quarters and pricing has continued to be strong for quite a while now, is that sustainable? And here you see it ticking up and I think we just keep going through the litany of pricing is going to be a reaction to what's your - what's your return target and what's happening in the loss environment. So we talk about continued increased frequency and severity of weather losses and you see that certainly this quarter, headline inflation, social inflation, that we said never went - never went away, and an uncertain overall macro environment. So those things continue to factor into our pricing. Those things also get evaluated every quarter and every year in terms of our view of loss trend in prior-year reserve development. So what you're seeing here again across the place, net favorable prior-year reserve development, I get the focus on the liability lines so - but really what you're seeing there is a degree of difference as opposed to some surprise. We've been talking about inflation for a long time and we were the first people to be talking about social inflation and never thought that went anywhere. So directionally, it's not a surprise. It's just an adjustment to the order of magnitude.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then for Michael, and maybe Greg, I guess, on the cat front, I mean, you guys were highlighting a frequency of events. But it seems like to me that severity must be at least as bigger of a contributor. Then maybe I'll just talk about - yes, in other words, I don't think I would have ever expected $1 billion of personalized with 6 Bcf] events. So from a severity perspective, like how - what's weighing on is here? Is it like the size of the hail, in other words, like the nature of the weather? Or how much of is elevated repair cost, demand surge like that type of thing?\nMichael Klein: Hi, Ryan, it's Michael. Yes, all of that. So I think your point is a good one. So if you look at the quarter, I think the number of events, PCS designated events was 19, that is above the long-term average. So there is a frequency of events that's higher. And that's a relatively high number for Q2. But actually, the majority of it really is severity. Now, some of that severity, to your point, is the underlying weather activity itself. I think on average, the events in this second quarter impacted about eight states apiece as opposed to six states apiece, so they were a little broader and more all-encompassing. And then again, historical averages. So you've got the number of events and then the size and magnitude. There certainly are anecdotal total evidence of more severe larger hail, those types of things. But the other item that you mentioned, it really is as big, if not a bigger factor than sort of the frequency and the magnitude of the events, and that's just insured values and cost to repair and the severity pressures that we've been talking about across both auto and property and frankly any first-party coverages that we offer as an organization really exacerbating that. So I think it's - I think it's all of those things, but it's at least as much a severity issue, and at least as much driven by economic inflation as it is the weather activity itself.\nGregToczydlowski: And Brian, from a Business Insurance or a commercial point-of-view, we weren't immune from some of the same dynamics that Michael just articulated. I think we just have a broader array of products that you get a little more diversification when you add the workers' comp, the GL and all the other products on top of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Scott: Hi, good morning. First one I have is on the Business Insurance underlying loss ratio improvement. I was hoping you could help us unpack it a little in terms of workers' comp versus maybe the other products. Certainly, the reserve development is sort of a good indication of how healthy things are on workers' comp, but pricing is down. I mean, is that a business line that's helping the underlying improvement year-over-year, or is it detracting from it? Could you kind of dimension that and help us think through some of the underlying drivers?\nDan Frey: Yes, Alex. It's Dan. We're really - we don't do profitability by line. We're not going to go into that level of detail. You call out comp, it has been a good line for us. It continues to be - continues to be a good line for us, but really the way to think about BI is the blend of the products and that's the level at which we will talk about the underlying.\nAlex Scott: Okay. Second question I had is on pricing. There's, I'd say, more reacceleration in your pricing than we're hearing from, I guess, Marsh earlier today, and some of the barometers that are out there and so forth. Anything that's unique around the way you're approaching the market there? And could you help dimension it all, how much of that reacceleration of pricing is necessary for the reinsurance costs? You mentioned, it sounds like maybe loss cost trend hasn't moved that much. But help us think a little bit about how much of that can help you to tread water, first allow more underlying improvement?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, I think, we're going to try to stay away from forecasting margins, and I think, it may have been David who went to this question earlier, and just said renewal premium change is close to 13% and you're saying there's not a lot of movement in loss trend, it was - sort of should we take it on face value? I think, broadly the answer is yes. But really, I think what's going on here is there are some headwinds. There is - there - reinsurance costs are higher, inflation is higher, we're in a tight labor market, there's weather and so on So we're reacting to all those things. And on the other hand, after years of pretty good pricing returns, we're in a pretty good place. And so hats off to our field organization. They are threading that needle incredibly well. And returns are excellent, and we're pricing to continue to maintain and maybe even improve the returns.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question, within BI, the underlying loss ratio improved. When we look at the quarter, right, improve - the improvement year-over-year was about 300 basis points. And I know you guys said that there was a 150 basis points from better property results. I think that was 1 point negative last year. So if we're looking year-over-year, is it right to say, it was 2.5 points better on property, and then the remainder, like 50 basis points is earned rate over trend or is there something else going on, and I know that's just kind of looking all-in, but something else going on with the margins in the quarter?\nDan Frey: Yes, Elyse. It's Dan. So I think you're thinking about the property piece, the right way. And then there's 50 basis points left over, and Greg mentioned the continued benefit of earned pricing. That's not the only thing going on in there. As always, there are - there are pluses and minuses. We're trying to call out the main drivers for you, and those are - those are the two main drivers. If there was anything else of real significance, I think we do a pretty good job of trying to make sure we include that in the commentary.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question on - the ROCE improved a good amount sequentially. It sounds like that was broad-based in property and liability lines. I know this is obviously a bigger quarter for property in terms of business mix. I just want to get a sense of just confirm that I'm thinking about that right that it was more than just property that drove the improvement in ROCE. And how should we think about - any color you could just give in terms of that ROCE as we think about the Q3 and beyond?\nAlan Schnitzer: Are you talking about renewal price change, Elyse, is that?\nElyse Greenspan: I was talking about the renewal rate, but - renewal rate - yes, in BI.\nGregToczydlowski: Yes, Elyse, you're right. I mean, clearly, we had a real strong quarter in terms of both rate and exposure in property. But we also had significant movement across the rest of the portfolio also, again, in both rate and exposure.\nAlan Schnitzer: I'd say, at least, if you're asking whether it was broad-based or narrow, I think the answer to that it was broad-based.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple here. First, for Jeff, I know you talked about surety losses just being a couple and they can be lumpy. But then are we seeing any signs of maybe some pressures in that line from a loss cost perspective given what's going on with commercial real estate and other things that are happening right now?\nJeff Klenk: Hi, Brian. It's Jeff. Thanks. I would say that we're watching inflation in materials and labor costs relative to construction. But honestly, really I think the prepared remarks really summed it up for you, right? We had a couple of losses that drove the underlying loss ratio change and ultimately this can be a lumpy line, and we feel really good about our market-leading surety book.\nBrian Meredith: Maybe Higher interest rates matter also, I mean, when you get a big jump in financing costs, right, for contractors and stuff?\nJeff Klenk: Sure. The credit availability for our contractors is absolutely an issue. We take that into account with our high credit quality book of business the way we underwrite this book. We got a high-quality book of contractors that we focus on there. And so your point is well taken. It's a part of the underwriting process. That's where I'd leave it. Thanks for the question.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks, Jeff. And then, Mike, I'm just curious, can you talk a little bit about kind of the regulatory environment right now in personal lines? Obviously, some states are getting a little more content on rate, but are we seeing any push back kind of starting to emerge from certain states as far as the level of rate going through?\nMichael Klein: Yes, Brian, thanks for thanks for the question, and I think it's - I think it's a good observation. As we talk about pretty consistently, we feel pretty good about our relationships with the departments of insurance, are we really endeavored to make sure they have all the information necessary to evaluate and approve our rate increase requests? And starting with us, we continue to file for increases that align with our most recent experience and our indicated rate needs. That said, what we're seeing and you're seeing in the headlines, some news about increased scrutiny and/or states considering or proposing changes to the way that they regulate pricing in response to the continued period of increases necessary to keep up with loss costs. And so I'd say, on the margin, there is a couple of places where it's getting a little more challenging. But broadly speaking, we have still been able to file and get approved the rate we think we need in response to the increased costs.\nBrian Meredith: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Shanker: Yes, thank you. Alan, you began the conference call with the preamble on artificial intelligence and analytics. It's been an unusual three years in terms of interpreting loss cost trend with the courts being open and closed during COVID and very wildly changing conditions under loss trend. Is the data quality that you are looking at right now any less reliable in your mind than you think that normally is? are we in a state where extra caution needs to be placed on being comfortable with those numbers that you're using for reserving practices?\nAlan Schnitzer: I would say the answer to that Josh is, yes. And I think we've said pretty consistently over the last few years that we have been cautious and reflecting that level of uncertainty into the way we think about loss cost and reserves. So I think the answer is yes, and we've been doing exactly that.\nJoshua Shanker: And then, I mean, look, we're all just throwing shelves from the cheap seats, a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about some of that, how you get more conservative or how you - in a time of uncertainty, how you get better or what you're doing in order to offset the risks associated around what's bad data and whatnot?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, it's probably a longer conversation, Josh. We can follow-up it. But let me just give you one example, and I think we've said this over the last couple of years. If you were just looking at the data, you might have assumed that some aspects of loss trend had improved over the last couple of years. And whether that's true in Personal Insurance, and you see the lack of negative PYD in personal auto, for example. Or if you look at social inflation, we said if the courts were closed, then that data could have been misinterpreted to mean things are getting better. You look at that data and you say, I don't believe it and we understand that it's distorted and that there are other things that could be impacting it. And so we are going to do the best we can to try to understand where the uncertainty is coming from and to make sure that we're - that we're reflecting our view of uncertainty as we're thinking about either our prior-year reserves or managing our current loss taxes.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I want to start with a question on personal lines. Michael mentioned that the deceleration and claim cost inflation wasn't as strong as we anticipated. I thought you could give us some color on what - I guess, the indicators that you've previously used what they're suggesting for personal loss cost inflation for the back half of the year?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Meyer, I don't - I don't know that - that the external indicators that we look at are significantly different than the ones you look at or have - or do have available. What I can say is, auto severity has sort of remained stubbornly in the low-double-digits, and we had not anticipated that it would remain in double-digit territory for this long. I think the other thing I commented on in my prepared remarks was that we are seeing some signs of easing. The predominant thing, I'm talking about there is the Manheim Wholesale Index. And again, an update just came out this week on that, and I believe Manheim's estimate now is that used car prices will end 2023 below 2022 levels. But importantly, that's just one element of our loss cost, right? So wholesale car prices impact retail car prices, which impact our total loss settlement values, which is a portion of our loss cost. I think one of the reasons you continue to see double-digit pressure on severity is continued elevation in repair costs, labor, materials, et cetera. And then again, we've talked about just broad-based severity pressure. I think what we are seeing is some of the potential good news that we're starting to see in the physical damage coverages is being offset a little bit by this shift in mix to more claims with bodily injury and property damage and so on a mix - that mix impact impacts those loss costs as well. But again, the short answer is, we're still seeing low-double-digit trends in auto severity and we hadn't anticipated that they would last this long.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That's helpful. And final question. When we look at, I guess, whether it's possibly changing weather patterns or the mix shift within BI slightly towards property or just inflation pushing more weather losses above the cat threshold, how do you think about sort of the magnitude of coming year's catastrophe load compared to where you've been recently?\nAlan Schnitzer: I'm not sure we're quite ready to talk about that or to certainly give an outlook for that. Obviously, as we start to put our views together for 2024 and beyond, we'll think about the experience that we've had this year and in recent years, and other factors whether that's changes in exposure in our book or other things and we'll come up with a view that we hope will be sort of thoughtful and appropriate.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one more question. Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui of Barclays. Please go-ahead.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Good morning. My focus these days is on the liabilities, and I especially appreciate your legal perspective, given your background, Alan, and I am not sure if AJ is on the call or not. Last quarter, you indulged me by talking about this. And this quarter, I'm wondering if you can indulge me again and talk about PFAS. Sorry in advance, my question is quite meaty. Is PFAS, a chemically - a chemical explicitly excluded from GL, like included in a pollution exclusion. And for pre-1986 exposure, does the statute of limitations apply?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. Tracy, it's hard to answer a question like that without claiming a policy. So I'm going to - I'm going to avoid that. And we're happy to take this offline with you and talk a little bit more about it if we can do that consistent with Reg FD. About PFAS, what I would say about that is, this issue has now been around for a while. What we know about it is, it is reflected in our reserves, and I'm not sure there's a lot more to say about it at this point.\nTracy Benguigui: Okay. So you said, reflected in your reserves, so the adverse development you took in the quarter didn't reflect an update to PFAS.\nAlan Schnitzer: Didn't say that Tracy, but we're not going to really go into the drivers. We gave you the big drivers of the - of PYD, We're not going to go into the specific coverage issues in PYD.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much. We appreciate everyone's time. And as always, if there's any follow-up, please feel free to reach out directly. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to report a terrific start to the year, including an excellent bottom-line result for the quarter, particularly in light of the high level of severe weather activity across the United States and very strong production in all three of our business segments, which produced net written premium growth of 12% for the quarter. Profitability and growth in our Business Insurance segment were particularly strong. And as you'll hear from Michael, we're positioned for improved profitability in our Personal Lines business. Core income for the quarter was $970 million, or $4.11 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 14.5%. Core income benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.9 billion, up 10% compared to the prior-year period, an excellent underlying combined ratio of 90.6% and a one-time tax benefit. Catastrophe losses were elevated as the industry experienced the highest number of Q1 PCS catastrophe events since PCS started tracking in the 1950s. Turning to investments. Our high-quality portfolio generated net investment income of $557 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting reliable results from our fixed income portfolio and positive returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to return $680 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $462 million of share repurchases. At the same time, we grew adjusted book value per share and made important investments in our business as we notched another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. In light of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared an 8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.00 per share, marking 19 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 8% over that period. The Board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases. Turning to the top-line in production. Thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field, we grew net written premiums by 12% this quarter to a record $9.4 billion, with all three segments contributing. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 15% to $5.2 billion. You may recall that we entered into a quota share arrangement with Fidelis for 2023. This contributed about $160 million, or around 3.5 percentage points, net written premium growth in the segment. Results from the quota share are not reflected in our production statistics. Renewal premium change in Business Insurance remained historically high at 9.6%. Pure renewal rate change ticked up a little bit from the fourth quarter, driven by the property, umbrella and auto lines. Even with continued strong pricing broadly, retention in Business Insurance was very strong at 87%. New business of $639 million was a record and up 17% from the prior-year period. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased slightly from a very strong level in the prior-year quarter, with excellent retention of 90% and new business growth of 25% in our management liability business, and a record level of Q1 net written premium in our surety business. Given the attractive returns and the high quality of business in our commercial segments, we are very pleased with strong production results in these businesses. In Personal Insurance, top-line growth of 12% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change increased to 20.2% in our homeowners and other business, and a 13.9% in our auto business. Another quarter of terrific production across the board positions us well for the year ahead. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. In light of the recent disruption in the banking sector, I'd like to share a reminder about how our business differs from those in the headlines. We often talk about the high quality of our investment portfolio and I'll get back to that, but first, let me say a few words about our prudent management of that portfolio. The banking sector disruption started with an acceleration of liabilities in the form of withdrawals from demand deposit accounts. As we all know, there's no acceleration of our largest liabilities, loss reserves. In other words, there's no such thing as a run on the bank in our business. But the banking episode also highlighted the risk to the equity of an enterprise when the duration of assets and liabilities are mismatched. We manage the duration of our assets relative to our liabilities. Such as on an economic basis, we've effectively defused our insurance liabilities. In other words, increases or decreases in interest rates generally have offsetting impacts on the present value of both our investment portfolio and our outstanding insurance liabilities. This essentially boxes the economic impact of changes in interest rates. As we've explained in response to your questions over the years, this is a reason why we didn't reach for yield by increasing duration in the low interest rate environment over the past decade and a half. In addition to duration, the bank solvency issues also highlighted the importance of thoughtfully managing liquidity. Quarter in and quarter out, we've consistently generated strong cash flows from operations. Our cash flows from premiums alone over the course of the year are consistently greater than our annual payments for claims and expenses. That was true throughout the 2008 financial crisis and more recently throughout the pandemic. We also have a steady and reliable stream of cash flows from our very high-quality fixed income portfolio. In addition to the periodic interest payments we receive on the bonds we hold, the proceeds from our maturing investment each month provide an additional source of liquidity. Back to the high quality of our investment portfolio, macroeconomic uncertainty reminds us of how important that is. And the quality of our holdings and our disciplined focus on risk adjusted returns distinguish us. Our fixed income investments are highly diversified. They have an average credit rating of AA and comprise 93% of our investments. Our alternative investments are also high quality and well diversified. Page 20 of our webcast presentation includes further details. To address another topic that's been in the news lately, Page 21 of the webcast presentation includes information demonstrating the relatively nominal risk we have in our investment portfolio related to commercial real estate. Real estate represents a small percentage of our total invested assets. Our fixed income real estate investments are very high quality and the largest component of our non-fixed income real estate investments is wholly-owned properties. The wholly-owned properties are carried at their depreciated historical cost. In other words, they were never written up when market values were high, and the appraised value of the portfolio is well above book value. The portfolio has also produced a strong free cash flow yield. In short, whether we're talking about underwriting or investing, Travelers is built to manage through uncertain times. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll share with you that we just returned from our annual conference with our most significant distribution partners who collectively represent more than half of our premium. We all left with the continued confidence that our relationships with these business leaders and their firms are as strong as ever, and feeling tremendous support for the strategic initiatives that we have underway. It's a great reminder that our position with distribution sets us apart and is an important competitive advantage that's hard to replicate. To sum things up, we're off to a great start for the year with another quarter of strong profitability and growth, driven by our underwriting and investment expertise. At the same time, we continue to successfully execute on our innovation strategy, which has contributed to significantly accelerated premium growth, superior returns and industry low volatility over the past decade. With the best talent in the industry, we remain well positioned for success through a wide range of economic and operating environments, and confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value overtime. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $970 million and core return on equity was 14.5%. Compared to the prior year, this year's first quarter results included a significantly higher level of catastrophe losses and a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development. Those unfavorable items were largely offset by higher underlying underwriting income, including a one-time tax benefit. The tax benefit impacts the income tax line only, and thus, does not impact the combined ratio or the underlying combined ratio. Our first quarter results include $535 million of pre-tax cat losses, significantly higher than the prior year's benign results, and about $160 million above the average of our first quarter cat losses for the past five years. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $797 million was $131 million higher than the prior-year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an improved underlying combined ratio of 90.6%. Results were again very strong in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty, while in Personal Insurance, we made significant progress in obtaining price increases that position us to get back to target returns. The first quarter expense ratio of 28.7% was again very strong. Our ongoing investments in strategic initiatives are balanced by our continued focus on productivity and efficiency and strong top-line growth, resulting in an expense ratio that, as expected, was broadly consistent with last year's first quarter and full year figures. We reported net favorable prior-year reserve development of $105 million pre-tax in the first quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $19 million pre-tax was driven by another quarter of favorable development in workers' comp, largely offset by an increase for umbrella liability coverages and environmental exposure in our run-off book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $58 million pre-tax was driven by better-than-expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal Insurance recorded $28 million pre-tax of net favorable PYD, driven by improvement in the homeowners' book. After-tax net investment income increased 3% from the prior-year quarter to $557 million. Fixed income NII was higher than in the prior-year quarter benefiting from both higher fixed income yields and higher level of invested assets. Returns in our non-fixed income portfolio remained positive, but were, as expected, less favorable than in last year's quarter. We are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, to $530 million after tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $555 million in the third quarter and then to around $575 million in the fourth quarter. Remember, only about 10% of the portfolio turns over each year, so the higher new money rates will take a while to fully impact run rate NII. Regarding the tax line, this quarter included a one-time tax benefit of $211 million with respect to the repeal of internal revenue code section 847, which addressed the discounting of property casualty loss reserves. And as a reminder, last year's first quarter included a $47 million benefit from the favorable resolution of our most recent federal income tax audits. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. As interest rates decreased during the quarter, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $4.9 billion after tax at year-end to $3.9 billion after tax at March 31. Remember, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses did not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high, and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $116.55 at quarter-end, up 2% from year-end and up 4% from a year ago. We returned $680 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, including share repurchases of $462 million and dividends of $218 million. As Alan mentioned earlier, our Board authorized an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.00 per share and also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases on top of the $1.6 billion remaining under the prior authorization. Let me wrap up my comments today on a personal note. A few weeks ago, we announced that on June 2, our friend and colleague Doug Russell, will retire after a 40-plus year career, about 25 of which have been with travelers. And for the past five years or so, Doug has held two very important roles, Corporate Controller and Treasurer. Doug is knowledgeable. He is unflappable and he is one of the very nicest people you could ever have the good fortune to know. He's also a great teacher. And in addition to being invaluable to me when I took over the Corporate CFO role, Doug has positioned us well for the future. We're fortunate to have two highly-capable long-time Travelers' employees ready to step in. Paul Munson will take over as Corporate Controller, and Larry Mills will take over as Treasurer. Thank you, Doug, for all that you have done for the success of our company as well as for the success of the finance professionals who've had the privilege of working for you and working with you. And now, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance continues to deliver exceptional results, with a strong first quarter of 2023 in terms of both top- and bottom-line results. Segment income of $756 million was up 13% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher underlying underwriting income. In addition to higher earned premium and the lower underlying combined ratio, underlying underwriting income also benefited from the segment share of the one-time tax benefit that Dan mentioned. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's underlying combined ratio of 89.6%, which was more than 2 points better than the prior-year quarter. The improvement was driven by the loss ratio, which benefited from property losses that were lower than a somewhat elevated level in the prior-year quarter and the benefit of earned pricing. The expense ratio was a strong 29.8%, and continues to benefit from the combination of the leverage from higher earned premiums and our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. Net written premiums increased 15% to an all-time quarterly high of $5.2 billion, benefiting from historically high renewal premium change and retention, as well as record new business levels. As you heard from Alan, the Fidelis quota share also contributed to the higher net written premiums. Turning to domestic production for the quarter, renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.6%, with renewal rate change ticking up sequentially to 4.7% and continued strong exposure growth. Retention of 87% also remained exceptional, while new business was up 17% from the first quarter of last year to a record high of $639 million. We're thrilled with these production results and our field superior execution in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to be able to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change to address the persistent environmental headwinds. And given our high-quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. Lastly, we are particularly pleased that our ongoing focus on our strategic investments help us drive an increased flow of new business opportunities. And we capitalized on those opportunities by being more responsive in quoting and converting on more quality accounts during the quarter. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remained strong at 10%, while retention increased [a point] to an exceptional 84%. New business increased 16% from the prior-year quarter to $129 million, driven particularly by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In middle market, renewal premium change was 8.1%, with renewal rate change increasing sequentially to 4.4%, while exposure growth was once again strong at 4.1%. Retention remained exceptional at 89% and new business was up 19% from the prior-year quarter with increases across all account sizes in most markets. As I mentioned a moment ago, we're pleased with the impact that our focus on strategic initiatives is having on our production results. To sum up, Business Insurance had a great start to the year. We continue to grow our profitable book while investing in capabilities to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty started the year with a great quarter on both the top- and bottom-lines. Segment income of $207 million was slightly lower than the prior-year quarter. Pre-tax income improved slightly as higher levels of net favorable prior year reserve development and net investment income were mostly offset by losses related to disruption in the banking sector. A lower favorable income tax adjustment in the current quarter more than offset this pre-tax improvement. The segment combined ratio was an excellent 80% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was a solid 86.1%, with the 3.9 points increase primarily driven by losses related to a few financial institutions and a higher expense ratio, partially offset by the benefit of earned pricing. Our quality risk selection and disciplined limits management continue to position us well to navigate through uncertain economic conditions. Turning to the top-line. Net written premiums were strong and consistent with our exceptional top-line in the prior-year quarter, which, as you might recall, grew by over 20%. In domestic management liability, considering our strong returns, we're very pleased that retention continued to be at a near-record 90%, a 5 points improvement from the prior-year quarter, and that renewal premium change was solid at 5%. We're also pleased that we increased new business 25% from the prior-year quarter. As Alan mentioned during his opening remarks, we're pleased to have driven a very strong and record level of first quarter surety net written premiums. So, both top- and bottom-line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, driven by excellent execution, benefits from our ongoing and strategic investments and the market-leading competitive advantages and franchise value that we offer our customers and distribution partners. And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, first quarter segment income was $83 million. The combined ratio of 101.5% increased approximately 6 points from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher catastrophe losses, primarily related to the significant tornado and hail events in March. The underlying combined ratio of 92.9% was comparable to the prior year, as the benefit of earned pricing across all products, lower losses in the homeowners and other product line and a lower expense ratio were offset by elevated losses in the automobile product line. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 12%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both domestic automobile and homeowners. In automobile, the first quarter combined ratio was 104.7% with an underlying combined ratio of 103.4%. The underlying combined ratio increased 4.6 points from the prior year due to increased vehicle replacement and repair costs, higher bodily injury severity and, to a lesser extent, higher frequency. These increases were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing as well as a lower expense ratio. In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 98.5% increased 7.3 points, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.7% improved 4.2 points, reflecting lower losses associated with mild winter temperatures in the Eastern and Central United States, as well as the benefit of earned pricing and a lower expense ratio. These benefits were partially offset by elevated loss severity from continued labor and materials price increases. As a reminder, for homeowners, we expect the upcoming second quarter to be the seasonally highest quarter for weather-related losses. Turning to production. Our results demonstrate the impact of rate and non-rate actions in both lines, as we seek to improve profitability and manage growth. In domestic automobile, renewal premium change of 13.9% increased 2.5 points from the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect renewal premium change to be modestly higher than this level throughout the remainder of 2023. We've shared previously that we expect written pricing in auto to be adequate in states, representing the majority of our premium by mid-year. While the loss environment is incrementally more challenging, we are adjusting our pricing plan accordingly and still expect to get there or very close to it. We will continue to pursue rate increases necessary to deliver target returns and the benefits of this increased pricing will earn into our results over time. As we've taken significant pricing actions, retention and growth in auto have continued to moderate as expected. Policies in force declined 1% from year-end 2022. In domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change of 20.2% increased approximately 6 points from the fourth quarter. We expect renewal premium change to remain at this elevated level through the end of the year. In the face of these increases, retention declined but remained strong, new business written premiums were in line compared to the prior-year quarter, and policies in force remained consistent relative to year-end 2022. In Personal Insurance, we entered the year with continued focus on disciplined marketplace execution in response to a loss environment that remains challenging. In addition to making more progress in pricing, we continue to implement non-rate actions. Examples include tighter underwriting in both auto and home, and improved pricing segmentation and risk selection in property. We're encouraged by the progress we're making towards our goal of achieving target returns. While we have more work to do, we are confident that the actions we have taken and will continue to take will improve profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond. Now, I will turn the call back to Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Michael. I'd like to add to Dan's recognition of Doug Russell. I met Doug in 2022 during Travelers' IPO. He's been a great friend and a source of endless expertise and insight ever sense. Doug, we thank you and we'll miss you around this table in particular, and thanks for leaving us in such good hands. Abbe, back to you.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Alan. Okay, we are ready to open up for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGreg Peters: Well, good morning, everyone. And I guess where I'd like to start off is on the top-line growth in the Business Insurance, the 15%. I'm looking at Slide 8 of your presentation. Can you provide some color on the various lines that are going up? I was intrigued by national property. And then, the geography of Fidelis, is that an international? And when I think about property, can you talk about where the growth is coming from in the context of what we're seeing in reinsurance costs?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Good morning, Greg. Yeah, this is Greg. First of all, I'll take the national property one. Yeah, clearly, we shared with you in the fourth quarter that post some of the severe weather activity in the fourth quarter, we did expect a hardening of the reinsurance market, and we are going to be in such a good position given our gross line underwriting mentality. And I think that's what's playing out ultimately in some of the growth in national property. It is mostly driven by renewal premium change, although we are getting the opportunistic looks at new business, but most of that growth really is coming through pricing. In terms of Fidelis, I mean, Alan made his comments. If you look at the webcast, you can see the domestic production up 11%. So, when you look at all the businesses from select to national property, again, double-digit growth, and we're feeling terrific about that growth. And similar to national property, most of that growth is coming through price increases. But again, some thoughtful new business, adding quality accounts to the portfolio has been in addition to the pricing.\nGreg Peters: Great. And then, my follow-up question, just pivoting to inflation assumptions. If we're watching CPI data, it still seems like there's inflationary pressures. And maybe, Alan, you can give us your view of how you think inflation is going to affect your loss cost assumptions for the current accident year?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Greg. I guess I would say that we're pretty confident that in our loss picks, we're contemplating everything that is going on that could impact loss cost, and that includes inflation. And we're only trying to predict out as far as the duration of the liabilities. And so, we feel pretty comfortable with the picks. We're certainly seeing inflation. You see it more prominently in Personal Insurance where you've got shorter tail lines and more of the loss cost impacted by things like materials cost and labor, and you see it relatively less in our commercial lines, because just -- that's just a lower portion of the loss cost. But I guess that's what I'd say, Greg.\nGreg Peters: Got it. All right. Thanks for the answers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning. Thanks. Maybe focusing on the Business Insurance segments, Cognizant results were good. But just curious, Greg, you mentioned persistent environment -- environmental headwinds. Reserve releases were lower than expectations in that line. And sorry to be harping on the negative, but umbrella liability was called out as one of the reasons and the environmental reserve addition looks like it was lower year-over-year looking at the Q. So, just any comments there?\nAlan Schnitzer: What's -- Mike, what's the question? I've -- we heard are commentary...\nMike Zaremski: Sorry. Curious about what Greg meant about the persistent environmental headwinds. Are you speaking to inflation picking up a bit or kind of staying kind of at levels that are a bit above historical trend?\nAlan Schnitzer: Mike, I'll turn it back to Greg if I miss anything here, but there's -- I think there's nothing new in that comment. It's reinsurance pricing, it's economic inflation, it's tight labor market, it's weather frequency and severity and so on. But it's a continuation of trends we've been facing for some time.\nGreg Toczydlowski: Mike, the only thing I'd just add and I think that's what's driving the renewal premium change of close to 10% and ultimately the combined ratio of sub-94% and an underlying of sub-90%. So, I feel like given those headwinds, we're operating very well in terms of relationship to them.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, great. Last question just on personal lines. Clearly, good momentum on the pricing side, clear about your comments about rate adequacy in most states. But if we just look at the combined ratios, it -- in your comments, it looks like inflation is staying much higher for longer in both auto and home. I don't know if you'd agree with that or anything you want to call out or that maybe is getting better or one-time in nature. Thanks.\nMichael Klein: Sure, Mike. It's Michael. Yes, I would say, I would agree inflation is higher for longer continuing to put pressure on both lines. And I called that out as a driver of the continued deterioration in auto, and then a little bit of an offset to some of the improvement in property. So, we continue to face that persistent inflation pressure. The other thing just to be really clear on the comment about rate adequacy, right, that's a comment about written adequacy for business we're putting on the books, which is really a prospective view, and certainly the GAAP financials will lag that, because we need that rate to earn through before it shows up in the GAAP financials, which is why I've been consistently commenting that it will take time for those rate changes to earn through. But we do see continued momentum in pricing in both auto and home, and I'll give you a quick example. We were actually really pleased last Friday to get approval from the State of California for 19 points of rate in auto effective May 31st, which is one of the elements of that prospective view and one piece of the puzzle in terms of why we see renewal premium change going higher from here.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple of quick ones here for you. First, I'm just curious, Michael, did you have any effect in your auto results from the additional claims that were filed in Florida as a result of the legislation? Any pressure -- any anything on reserve? I know you're relatively small there, but any impact at all?\nMichael Klein: Yes, thanks, Brian. No, we did not have an impact from the Florida lawsuit filings in our result, and that's largely due to the fact that the comment that you just made, our auto market share in Florida is about 2%. So, it's a relatively small exposure for us.\nBrian Meredith: Great. That's helpful. And then, secondly, on the commercial lines, I'm just curious, in Business Insurance, Fidelis coming in. I'm assuming it was relatively small from an earned premium perspective. But as we think about that continuing to earn in your Business Insurance results, is that going to have favorable impact on your underlying loss ratios here? Does it have a more property component maybe better underlying loss ratios?\nDan Frey: Hey, Brian, it's Dan. I'll take that. So, look I think the short answer as we said at the end of the fourth quarter is it's just not going to be big enough to move the needle a lot. If it plays out the way that we hope it would play out, it would be -- it would have a very modest favorable impact to underlying combined ratio and business insurance. The first quarter, it's tiny, because the earned premium component of a partial earning is just not that big. And then, the only other thing I'll throw out there as a reminder since you mentioned the property book or any other business that they write, we do have a loss ratio cap on that quota share, so it can't really hurt us badly on the other side.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So first, just had a question on Business Insurance. If you look at price increases, they've been fairly steady over the past several quarters, but inflation stayed pretty high as well. So, as you think about your margins in the business over the next one to two years, do you think they'll improve further, or should we assume that more of the earnings growth will come from just the momentum in premiums?\nAlan Schnitzer: Hey, Jim, it's Alan. I think we'd like to get away from forecasting margins. What I will say is we have answered that question from time to time over the last year or so and, frankly, these written measures aren't that different than they've been over the last year or so. But we would like to get away from forecasting. What I will say is we are very, very pleased with the business we're putting on the books.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then, any color on sort of the timing of completing the buyback authorization? Is it the next two to three years, or is it more open ended? And, like, any sort of color on that?\nDan Frey: Hey, Jimmy, it's Dan. So, very open ended. We are rightsizing capital over time. It will depend on our view of capital strength. It will depend on what happens from a loss perspective. It will depend on our view of growth and how much capital we need to hold on to growth. I think what the increased authorization gives us is: one, recognition from the Board of the strong financial performance of the company; and two, it gives us a fair amount of flexibility to manage through whatever environment we see. But there is no targeted time horizon by which we're going to try and execute that remaining buyback authorization.\nAlan Schnitzer: And also no change in our capital management philosophy.\nJimmy Bhullar: Understood. And just lastly if I could just a follow up on the point on margins. If we think about the loss inflation in your Business Insurance division, should that be somewhat similar to what general CPI inflation is, or what are the puts and takes? Because at one point, I guess, social inflation was a big deal, but it seems like it hasn't come back the same way as it was prior to COVID.\nAlan Schnitzer: Jim, if you're talking about loss trend, there's -- we didn't make any changes to our trend assumptions in the quarter.\nDan Frey: And Jimmy, it's Dan. On social inflation, just to clarify and I think we've said it probably every quarter for the last 10 quarters, social inflation was elevated. We called it early in late 2018. We saw it in 2019. We saw it in 2020. Even during COVID when the court slowed down, we don't think social inflation has gone anywhere. So, if you're thinking that social inflation is less of an issue now than it was, we don't think that, and we continue to book our loss reserves on that basis.\nAlan Schnitzer: But all of that reflected in the really exceptional margins we posted in the quarter.\nJimmy Bhullar: Yeah. And I see that you're booking at that level, but are you actually seeing that as well? Because it seems from the outside in that it's not as high -- doesn't seem as elevated as it has been.\nAlan Schnitzer: I think we're not going to comment beyond the combined ratio we printed in our comment on loss trend.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Scott: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First one I had was on Business Insurance. When I listened to the comments about the year-over-year change in underlying loss ratios and so forth, one of the things I didn't hear was sort of the mix shift maybe a bit towards property or impact from the reinsurance changes that you made, a little higher retention, et cetera. I mean, is that because that was not really too material to that? Or can you provide any color on how that may have impacted year-over-year comparisons of loss ratios?\nDan Frey: Yeah, Alex, it's Dan. So, I think you're coming to the right conclusion. Not a big impact -- excuse me, or we would have called it out. Because a reminder, we did say even back in the fourth quarter when we went through what the 1.1 reinsurance renewals looked like and where our attachment points were and what the cost was and what treaties we renewed and what treaties we didn't renew that we didn't expect that to have a big impact on margins going forward and that proved to be the case. Mix does move over time. We gave you the written premium numbers by line of business, so you can see that. But not a driving factor in the year-over-year margin comparison.\nAlex Scott: Got it. And then, maybe just in terms of the pricing, can you kind of unpack for us at all when we think about that modest reacceleration of renewal rate change? Can you help us think about what you're seeing among some of the different product lines?\nAlan Schnitzer: Alex, let me just try to respond to that with some general comments about the pricing environment and you can follow-up if we don't get to the question. I would say the pricing environment remains very strong. We saw, as you saw, in the numbers a little acceleration in renewal rate that was led by property, umbrella and auto. And we'll just have to see whether that's the start of the trend in that direction or it's not. And very significantly when you were thinking about prices, we've said many times even with another quarter of very strong pricing, retentions remain at historical highs, which for us is terrific given the attractive return. So, in broad strokes, and I think Greg included this in his commentary, there are two trends impacting pricing. On the one hand, there are headwinds and we've been seeing those for a while now, and they're still there, and that's what you see us reacting to. And on the other hand, after years of some pretty good pricing and improvements in terms and conditions, [returns in] (ph) a better place. And so, the pricing that you see us putting up is what we're achieving is really threading that needle incredibly well. I mean, hats off to our field organization for just really superior execution.\nAlex Scott: Yeah. All right. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your now question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJosh Shanker: Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. Could you -- I don't know what details I'm looking for [here, I have] (ph) some smart ones. Where are the courts shaping up right now? How is the backlog of cases come through? How efficiently are they handling current cases? Compared to where we were one, two, three years ago, where are we in that story?\nDan Frey: Hey Josh, it's Dan. So, I'll take a shot at that. Look, I think we were saying two years ago, that even when courts did reopen that we expected that it was going to take quite a while for the backlog to work its way through. We thought that was going to be measured in years, not in quarters. I think the data that we look at every quarter would so far confirm that to be true. So, in some of the most recent, say, three and six month diagonals, the amount of claims that are closing in a three or six month period is a little higher than the historical pattern would tell you it would be. But when you put that on a life to date basis for those accident years, closure rates are still lagging where they were pre-pandemic. And so that's what we're seeing. You're starting to see some of that backlog work its way through, but again we think we've got a long way to go there.\nJosh Shanker: And does the backlog mean that if I have a new incident in 2023, that it's going to be a extended period of time before it can see a courtroom?\nDan Frey: It depends, Josh. It depends jurisdiction by jurisdiction, it depends by type of claim, it depends by complexity of claims. So, I wouldn't say that as a universal rule. But I would say generally speaking, we're still modeling slower closure rates than pre-pandemic.\nJosh Shanker: I do appreciate the answers. Thank you.\nDan Frey: Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is open.\nTracy Benguigui: Thank you. Good morning. I'd also like to wish Doug Russell best of luck. I really enjoyed the interactions in my prior role over many years. Hey, since the Boy Scouts' appeal by insurance did not go through, wondering, were you holding out on that appeal passing or do you feel good about the IBNR reserves you set aside? It would also be helpful if you could quantify how much IBNR you set aside for reviver cases in general.\nDan Frey: Yes, Tracy. So, it's Dan. So, I'm not going to do the latter. You know from the way we've talked about reviver statutes, and those types of exposures going all the way back to the first quarter 2019 when New York implemented what for us was a pretty significant reviver statute. We're looking at what happened state-by-state quarter-by-quarter and reacting in real time as best we can. BSA is something that we and the whole industry has been watching for a long time. You generally don't see our name in the news in connection with that because we don't have anywhere near the exposures that some of the other folks have. We weren't necessarily going to be significantly swayed by bankruptcy proceeding or not proceeding one way or the other. We have all the information at our fingertips in terms of what's the latest and greatest, and that's what's baked into our reserves. In that regard, one thing I'll mention in case you were going to go there, in the month of April, the State of Maryland implemented a new reviver statute. It's not effective until October of '23, but because the law changed in the second quarter of '23, we'll do our assessment in the second quarter of '23. Too early to say with any certainty what that impact might be, but not expecting that to be a big deal for us at this point.\nTracy Benguigui: That's very helpful. Maybe just a follow-up question that Josh raised. I noticed in your 10-K, you've reported a lower number of -- cumulative number of reported claims. And I'm wondering when you set aside reserves if you think about a more normalized number of claims coming through considering the backlog in the court system?\nDan Frey: Tracy, I think for the last few years, we've said given the backlog in the court system and the delay in closure rates, there was more uncertainty in the loss environment, and we were trying to make sure that we allowed for that uncertainty when establishing our loss picks.\nTracy Benguigui: To something north of the reported claim, correct?\nDan Frey: No, we're not going to do frequency times severity. I'm just telling you that we'll recognize that there's a level of uncertainty in the environment and we're trying to factor that into our loss picks.\nTracy Benguigui: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the Business Insurance underlying loss ratio. Could you talk about some of the drivers of the improvement year-over-year and the sustainability of it going forward? And I'm specifically looking just for how much lower the non-cap property losses were this year versus the elevated level last year? And were they at a lower level than you would normally expect in a typical first quarter?\nDan Frey: Yes. Hey, David. Dan again. So, look, so the underlying combined improved by a couple of points, almost a half a point of that you could see was expense ratio. So, you got about 1.5 point in the loss ratio. And Greg's comments were slightly elevated level of property losses in last year's number and the continued benefit of earned pricing, neither of those are huge to the probably more salient point of your question at the end. We look at this quarter and see it as pretty clean quarter in terms of a jump off point, not really anything that was significant one way or the other that we think you'd adjust out for.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, just a question for Alan, just on the pricing environment and specifically for the property business. So, last quarter, I think you had said you saw property rate accelerate month-by-month in the quarter. Just wondering how that trended in the first quarter here. And just given property is a seasonally small part of the business in the first quarter, would you expect continued acceleration in renewal rate change in Business Insurance?\nAlan Schnitzer: I mean, the first quarter property pricing was -- we saw a continuation of that trend through the first quarter. I think we're going to try not to forecast and line pricing is not much more competitively sensitive than our pricing strategy. But given the hardening of the reinsurance market, there's a fair amount of activity in the pricing space. There's, overall, probably a constraint in capacity, and I think underwriters are generally just reacting to the loss environment.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Newsome: I've got a couple of auto and personal lines related questions. In the context of there're some rumors that Progressive is [getting back] (ph) to digital marketing a lot. The implications, they saw something in March that made them nervous about the business, it's been confirmed. But is there anything in the data that you saw sort of inter-quarter, as we went through the quarter, particularly in auto that would suggest some sort of market change either in the loss ratio or maybe even the sort of marketing piece of the business? Obviously, the average looks what you'd expect. But just wondering if there's anything in that inter-quarter level that we should be -- that would stand out at all?\nMichael Klein: Yes, Paul, it's Michael. I would say probably nothing that would stand out. I will tell you that the first quarter in auto is one of the tougher quarters to try to diagnose trends in because of changes in weather, when the weather improves, when you get winter storms or not, the sort of frequency and severity results in auto in Q1, sort of inter-quarter, as you described, are sort of the toughest to discern trends from really of any quarter in the year. And then, as you look at the external indices, you see wholesale used car prices moving around. One consistent trend we see underneath everything is parts and labor costs continuing to rise. That's been fairly steady for a long time. And then, again, a lot of the items that I mentioned, just impact driving behavior very differently from one year to the next. So, I wouldn't say I see anything on the loss side that's worth pointing out from within the quarter. And then, if you think about more of the business dynamics, to your point about digital advertising, et cetera, we continue to see healthy demand for quotes in the marketplace. And I think there's a variety of drivers of that, probably the biggest of which is the rate that's going through the marketplace and through the industry driving people to shop. So, I don't know if that was one of the elements you were trying to get at. But certainly, we see pretty healthy quote activity, again, through the quarter, not a lot of inter-quarter variability.\nPaul Newsome: That definitely helps me understand it better. And then, relatedly, I was just listening to your comments about personal line pricing. And maybe just a clarification, and I apologize if it's just me being confused. But it sounds like you're going to hit the expectations for guidance of rate adequacy on time. But was there an implication that essentially Travelers will have to kind of jack up the rates a little bit faster or a little bit higher than you previously expected because the underlying trends are a little bit worse? Or am I just not interpreting that correctly?\nMichael Klein: No, I think you're spot on, Paul. We have seen the loss experience be incrementally worse, frankly than it was and than we expected. And so, we have adjusted our rate plan for 2023 accordingly and are seeking more rate than we thought we would as we put the plan together for the year. And so that's -- but that is underneath the comment that I made about RPC going north from here for the balance of the year. So that expectation of where RPC is headed reflects both our original plans around rate and the additions that we're now seeking because the loss experience has been a little bit worse.\nPaul Newsome: Great. I'll always appreciate the help very much. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ward from Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just thinking about the small and Business Insurance clients, it seems like pretty healthy growth. I was hoping you could comment on what you're seeing there in terms of kind of macro trends?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Yes. Good morning, Michael, this is Greg. First, I'd point to the top-line in select, plus 11%. And you can see on the webcast, a lot of that is being driven by a strong pricing environment with a 10% RPC. But you can also see below that, that we've got real strong new business. New business is up 16% over the prior year, and we've shared with you the success of our BOP 2.0 product. So that's driving a lot of the new business. So, the combination of new business and pricing is really driving that strong top-line growth. And we're feeling terrific about the profit profile of that business and continue to invest in it.\nMichael Ward: Super helpful. Thank you. And then maybe on management liability, was hoping you could unpack some of the losses or expected losses in Bond & Specialty. And then, for management liability, any -- not necessarily asking for an outlook, but any commentary on pricing trends?\nJeff Klenk: Yes, Michael, this is Jeff Klenk. So, relative to the financial institutions, we've got some exposures on some of the financial institutions that were prominent in the news in the first quarter. We booked some losses for those over and above what we have in our loss picks. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, that's really the primary driver of the 3.9 points increase in the underlying combined ratio. And then, what was the second question?\nMichael Ward: Management liability pricing commentary?\nJeff Klenk: I think we wouldn't really give a projection on pricing going forward. I would say that given the healthy returns that we have in our portfolio, feel really very good about the 5 points of RPC that we got, the 90 points of RPC and you know that we're growing our new business. Thanks for the question.\nMichael Ward: Thank you.\nDan Frey: 90 points of retention.\nJeff Klenk: Oh, sorry about that. 90 points of retention and then growing the new business by 25%. Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Obviously, the pricing look better in middle markets, national property. It did look like it softened a bit in small commercial. I'm not sure if things are getting more competitive there or it's just a function of mix, but looking for some color on that?\nGreg Toczydlowski: Hey, Ryan, this is Greg. For this particular quarter, we do have a stronger weight in the select business, particularly of workers' comp. And so, given the continued negative rate environment that we're seeing broadly across the workers' comp industry, the select business felt that in the first quarter. But again, I'll point out the strong RPC overall at 10% exposure was really robust. And as we've shared with you before, there's a meaningful portion of that, that does behave like rate.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then, I guess, for Michael, I mean, we've seen modest sequential PIF declines in the past couple of quarters in home and auto, but nothing significant. How should we think about -- when you think about the rate that you've put through or you're planning to put through, are you feeling like we've probably seen kind of, I don't know, retention bottom or, I guess, anything on that? Like, are your clients kind of feeling the full impact of the type of rate that you put through yet?\nMichael Klein: Sure. Thanks, Ryan. I would say that as we continue to push rate and renewal premium change through the portfolio, we would anticipate some continued pressure. Again, not our primary focus. We're not wringing our hands over PIF growth at the moment. Our primary focus really is on improving profitability and the actions we need to take there. But we wouldn't be surprised if we see a bit of continued pressure on PIF as we continue to work to improve margins.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Pardon me. Great. Thanks so much for fitting me in. Two quick questions for Jeff. One, can you give us a little color on the expense ratio increase on year-over-year basis?\nJeff Klenk: Sure. So Meyer, I think we're making strategic investments to maintain and extend our competitive advantages, and so -- and to make sure that we're investing in our future success. The two biggest buckets on that would be people and technology. And I'd point out why we continue to deliver attractive returns. A little more color on what that investment is would really be to develop and extend our flow underwriting capabilities in what I'd say are these traditionally higher touch management liability and surety lines of business. And again, that's all in the context of a reported combined ratio of 80%.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. Second question, I guess, there -- I'm sorry, Greg called out some reserve issues related to the BI segment's general liability. It doesn't look like that problem manifest itself in Bond & Specialty in the quarter. Can you talk about, I guess, what's going on there, and why the same issues wouldn't present?\nDan Frey: Yeah, Meyer, it's Dan. I'll take the PYD question. I think just a different dynamic. Umbrella and we talked about it a little bit last quarter. You're writing excess coverages in an environment of inflation, whether it's both the combination of sort of CPI, headline-type inflation plus the fact that social inflation never went anywhere. What you've seen is some more items pierce into those higher layers. So, not directionally inconsistent with the way we would have thought about it, but the magnitude of it was different, and we're just trying to react to that as we see the data come in. Just a different dynamic in terms of the management liability exposures that exist in the BSI book. And it just hasn't had the same crossover.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. So that's a function of the book as opposed to the actual loss trend if I understand it correctly?\nDan Frey: I would say that's true, yes.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.\nDan Frey: Thanks, Meyer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. My first question, did you drop your workers' comp loss picks in the quarter?\nDan Frey: Well, we took favorable PYD at least -- be a little more specific on what your question is?\nElyse Greenspan: Sorry, I'm trying to get a sense of just how you booked the underlying year if you took down the picks and comp relative to where you were booking accident year 2022 and prior, on the current accident year?\nDan Frey: Yeah. I don't think so, Elyse. So, we -- you saw what we did in '22. '23, we do our normal process of projecting what we think loss trend is off of '22. Loss trend is still positive in workers' comp because we are making an assumption that severity is going to return to some more normalized level and not be as benign as it has been. And it's -- so '23 -- and '23, it's early in the year, we wouldn't have done anything to modify our pick at this point.\nElyse Greenspan: And then, in terms of personal auto, obviously, recognizing right, it's been a pretty hard environment in terms of loss trend for everyone. I had thought if in previous years, right, Q1 has at times been seasonally the best quarter when just looking at underlying combined ratios. You guys, obviously, have rate going to the system but that needs to earn in and trends remained high. Would you expect that same seasonality to persist that the other quarters of the year would be weaker on an underlying basis relative to the Q1? Or how should we think about the dynamics within personal auto?\nMichael Klein: Yeah, Elyse, it's Michael. I would say that we don't see anything that would cause us to change our view of seasonality in auto. And to your point, the biggest reason the combined ratio came down relative to fourth quarter of last year really is that seasonality. So, notwithstanding the year-over-year same-period-to-same-period deterioration, those seasonality trends still seem to be intact based on looking at this year's first quarter relative to last year's fourth quarter.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nYaron Kinar: Good morning. Thanks for allowing me in. Two questions, if I may. One, on the Florida reform, I realize your market share in Florida is underweight or [netting in] (ph) small overall, but would you expect there to be an impact beyond personal auto, maybe in some commercial lines as well?\nAlan Schnitzer: I'll say we are very, very encouraged by what they've done in Florida. We think it's great progress. And I think we're just going to wait and need to see how it plays out a little bit. It's been a pretty challenged market over a pretty long period of time, still competing against citizens. It's pricing at a subsidized level. The current reinsurance market doesn't help. So, I guess, I'd say we're going to watch it with great interest and continue to evaluate the opportunity, but we are very encouraged by what they've done in Florida.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then just on Slide 21 of the presentation on the real estate portfolio, again, realize high quality, relatively small. One thing that caught my eye is you said that the appraised values are meaningful -- meaningfully in excess of carrying value. I'm just curious how often the properties are appraised, or when were they last appraised?\nDan Yin: Hi, Yaron, this is Dan Yin from Investments. We go through an official appraisal every year annually. But quarterly, we do sort of notebook type of appraisal as well.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Thanks so much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: And I will now turn the call back over to Abbe Goldstein for some final closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you all for joining us today. And as usual, if there's any follow-up, please get in touch with Investor Relations directly, and have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."}], "2025": [{"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 3, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-10-17 11:57:08", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 17, 2024. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2024 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski, Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then, we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our prepared remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in our Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by acknowledging the devastation caused by recent hurricanes Helene and Milton. These were powerful storms and our hearts go out to all those who have been impacted. Of course, we send our thoughts and prayers, but we're also sending claim resources. From our national catastrophe center in Hartford, we're managing the deployment of hundreds of Travelers claim professionals, along with mobile claim offices and quick response vehicles. We've activated thousands more cross-trained colleagues across the country to support our local response. Our catastrophe response model enables us to adjust virtually every claim with the Travelers claim professional. And without resorting to independent adjusters, that results in a better outcome for our customers and distribution partners. Thanks to these efforts in the advanced analytics and geospatial tools that we leverage. We're on track this year to meet our objective of resolving 90% of our claims from natural catastrophes within 30 days. That can make the difference between whether a customer of ours is able to celebrate the holiday season in their living room instead of a hotel room. I'd also like to express my deep gratitude to our claim organization. The entire team tirelessly delivers exceptional technical expertise and support to our customers, demonstrating day-in and day-out, the value of the travelers promise. Turning to results. We are very pleased to have generated outstanding top and bottom line results this quarter. Excellent underlying underwriting income, higher net investment income and net favorable prior year reserve development, all contributed to core income, of more than $1.2 billion or $5.24 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 16.6%. Underlying underwriting income of $1.5 billion pre-tax was up 73% over the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $10.7 billion, up 10% and an underlying combined ratio that improved 5 points to an excellent 85.6%. Both underwriting income and underlying margins were strong in all three of our segments. The underlying combined ratio in our Business Insurance segment improved nearly 2 points to an excellent 87.9%. And our Bond & Specialty business delivered a very strong underlying combined ratio of 85.6%. The underline combined ratio in Personal Insurance improved 11.5 points to an exceptional 82.7%. These terrific segment results contributed to a reported consolidated combined ratio that improved nearly 8 points to 93.2%. Turning to investments. Our high quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, with after-tax net investment income up 16% to $742 million, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and higher returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 4% during the quarter, and that's after returning $496 million of excess capital to shareholders and continuing to make important investments in our business. As we notched another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 8% to $11.3 billion. The strong value proposition that we offer to our customers and distribution partners, along with outstanding execution by our colleagues in the field contributed to our top line success. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 9% to more than $5.5 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment remained very strong, increasing to 10.5%, driven by strong contributions from the liability coverages. Renewal rate change accelerated to 7.3% in the quarter, and was steady or higher in every product line. Even with the firm pricing environment, retention in the segment ticked up to 86%. The combination of strong pricing and excellent retention reflects our deliberate execution and a marketplace that is reacting in a generally disciplined way to the headwinds of social and economic inflation. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 7% to a record $1.1 billion, driven by excellent retention of 90% in our high quality management liability business and strong production in our market-leading surety business. We grew surety net written premiums by 7% from a very strong result in the prior year quarter. We are very pleased to have generated terrific production results across our commercial segments, where margins continue to be attractive. That includes our E&S offerings, where we've grown net written premiums by 13% year-to-date. In Personal Insurance, we were pleased to grow net written premiums by 7%, driven by strong renewal price change in both auto and home. The strong production results across our three segments are a reflection of our view that in order to achieve our objective of industry-leading returns over time, we need an effective strategy to grow profitably over time. As we've shared before, we seek to achieve profitable growth by investing in franchise value, making sure that we offer the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell. Also central to our growth strategy is our very granular approach to risk selection, underwriting and pricing, which we've discussed many times. As a result of that approach and investments we've made over decades in leading data and analytics, our growth in insured exposures correlates to returns. In other words, generally speaking, the more attractive the returns in the business, the more we've been growing insured exposures in that business, all of which is to say, Travelers unique combination of franchise value and execution yields very effective capital deployment, a high-quality, profitable growth. The numbers speak for themselves. Over the last four years, we've grown our premium base by more than $13 billion, nearly a 50% increase while simultaneously improving our underwriting margins. The result is that we've more than doubled our underlying underwriting income and increased our total underwriting income by more than 80%. The combination of strong underwriting income and the reliable investment income from our substantial and growing investment portfolio makes for a powerful earnings engine. That's what's driving our strong results this quarter and year-to-date, and that's what's driving our core return on equity of 15.9% over the last 12 months. And that's what gives us great confidence in the outlook for our business into 2025 and beyond. With that, I\u2019m pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. I'm pleased to provide some additional color on an exceptionally strong quarter. Core income for the third quarter was $1.2 billion, and core return on equity was 16.6%. As we delivered another quarter of excellent underlying underwriting results, net favorable prior year reserve development and strong investment income. We're pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent combined ratio of 93.2%, an improvement of nearly 8 points. Inside of that, our underlying combined ratio improved 5 full points from last year's strong results. This combination of premium growth and underlying margin improvement led to our best ever underlying underwriting gain of $1.2 billion after tax, up $503 million or 74% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the third quarter was 28.4% and reflects the benefits of our continued focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. That brings the year-to-date expense ratio to 28.6%, in line with our expectations. Our third quarter results include $939 million of pre-tax catastrophe losses, more than half of which relates to Hurricane Helene, a devastating storm, which made landfall in the last few days of the quarter. For travelers, the financial impact of Helene was greater in Georgia and the Carolinas than in Florida. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $126 million pre-tax. In Business Insurance, the annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $242 million. Ex-asbestos, Business Insurance had net favorable PYD of $151 million, driven by favorability in workers' comp. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $36 million was driven by another quarter of better-than-expected results in fidelity and surety. Personal Insurance had $181 million of net favorable PYD with favorability in both home and auto. After-tax net investment income of $742 million was up 16% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter and in line with our previously shared outlook. Reflecting the benefit of both higher average yields and significant growth in the portfolio. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also above the prior year quarter. In terms of our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, we now expect approximately $700 million after-tax for the fourth quarter. For 2025, we expect approximately $2.9 billion after-tax, our highest level ever, beginning with approximately $700 million in the first quarter of 2025 and growing to approximately $760 million for the fourth quarter. Turning to capital management. We generated our strongest ever level of quarterly operating cash flows at $3.9 billion. Bringing the year-to-date figure above $7 billion, also our strongest ever September year-to-date results. Interest rates decreased during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $4 billion after-tax at June 30th, to $2.1 billion after-tax at September 30th. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $131.30 at quarter end, up 7% from year-end and up 13% from a year ago. We returned $496 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $253 million and dividends of $243 million. We have approximately $5.3 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. While it obviously did not impact our third quarter results, let me make a quick comment on Hurricane Milton. It's still early days in terms of assessing our ultimate losses, but at this point, we have a preliminary range of between $75 million and $175 million of pre-tax losses net of reinsurance. To sum things up, our third quarter and year-to-date results illustrate the fundamental earnings power that has resulted from our multi-year focus on growth at attractive margins and our rock-solid balance sheet. In addition to best ever levels of net written premium and net earned premium, our diversified portfolio of businesses delivered a terrific underwriting result, thanks to our best ever underlying combined ratio clearly demonstrating that we are positioned for success even during periods of weather volatility, like, we and the industry have experienced. In fact, despite having absorbed the highest ever level of catastrophe losses for the first-nine months of the year, our September year-to-date core earnings per share of $12.43 is a record high. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter in terms of both top and bottom line results. Segment income for the third quarter was $698 million, up about 50% from the prior year quarter, driven by improved prior year development and higher underlying underwriting income. The combined ratio of 95.8% was strong and improved from the prior year quarter by more than 3 points. Similar to the past several quarters, we're extremely pleased with the quarter's exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 87.9%, which improved by about 2 points from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the benefit of earned pricing. This was our best third quarter underlying result ever. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 9% to an all-time third quarter high of more than $5.5 billion. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.5%, with renewal retains that increased nearly 1 point sequentially and to 7.3%, driving the majority of the strong pricing. Retention remained excellent at 86%, and a new business of $680 million was the second highest third quarter result ever, just slightly trailing last year's record third quarter. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change, which increased sequentially from the second quarter. Strong pricing was broad-based with renewal premium change at or close to double-digits in every line other than workers' comp. With respect to pure renewal rate change, we're pleased with the exceptional granular execution by our field organization reflects and appropriately balances the current return profile and environmental trends for each line. Umbrella and Auto continue to lead the way with rate increases well into double-digits. In terms of sequential renewal rate change, every line was at or higher than the second quarter. Even with these strong pricing levels, retention remains strong, as I mentioned earlier, a reflection of marketplace discipline in the face of industry headwinds. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remained strong at 12.3%, up almost 2.5 points from the third quarter of last year. Renewal rate change of 5.5% was up sequentially from the second quarter and up more than 2.5 points from last year's third quarter. Retention tick down as we continue to intentionally optimize our CMP risk return profile in a couple of targeted geographies. New business was healthy and near historical highs. Overall, we remain pleased with the granular pricing and underwriting execution, driving profitable growth in Select. In middle market, renewal premium change was exceptionally strong at 10.6%, about 1 point higher than the second quarter, driven by renewal rate change, which reached 8%. The rate increases were broad-based with more than three quarters of our middle market accounts achieving positive rate change. And at the same time, the granular execution was excellent with meaningful spread from our best performing accounts to our lower performing accounts. We're pleased that retention also remained exceptionally even with these levels of price increases. Lastly, new business of $364 million was our highest ever third quarter result. And we're pleased with the risk selection and the strength of pricing on the accounts that we added to the portfolio. To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution in driving strong financial and production results, while continuing to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted another strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $222 million and an excellent combined ratio of 82.5%. We also delivered a very strong 85.6% underlying combined ratio in the quarter. The increase of 4.9 points from last year's quarter reflects a modestly elevated expense ratio, primarily related to the Corvus acquisition and the impact of earned pricing. We expect the expense ratio to remain elevated for a few more quarters as we integrate Corvus' operation and as we ramp up and earn in premiums from its attractive book of business. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 7% in the quarter to a record high $1.1 billion. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90%, with positive renewal premium change that reflects terrific execution by our field organization and our focus on retaining our profitable book of business. We're pleased that we grew new business by over 80% from the prior year quarter, to a record $113 million, driven by Corvus. Nine months following the closing of our Corvus acquisition, we continue to feel terrific about the talent, capabilities and business that we've added to our cyber portfolio. We're deploying Corvus' proprietary underwriting and risk control capabilities across our Cyber book, helping our customers remediate vulnerabilities and avoid cyber losses. Our distribution partners have endorsed our go-to-market strategy, which includes both admitted and excess and surplus lines cyber offerings. And realizing the benefit of our high-quality travelers paper and brand, we've considerably improved Corvus' legacy renewal retention. In short, we couldn't be more pleased with the addition of the Corvus team to the Travelers family. Turning to our market-leading surety business. We grew net written premiums by 7% from a very strong level in the prior year quarter. This growth reflects a robust construction environment, continued strong demand for our surety products and services and outstanding execution by our team, and growing our high credit quality portfolio. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter in Bond & Specialty Insurance. And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, which continue to reflect the positive impact of our rate and non-rate actions across the portfolio. In the quarter, we delivered significantly improved segment income of $384 million and a combined ratio of 92.5%, driven by excellent underlying -- by an excellent underlying underwriting results and strong net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 82.7% reflects an 11.5 point improvement compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by the benefit of earned pricing in both auto and home, as well as favorable non-catastrophe weather. Continued strong price increases drove 7% growth in net written premiums as we continue our focus on improving profitability in property, while seeking profitable growth in auto. In auto, we're pleased with another quarter of improved profitability. The third quarter combined ratio was very strong at 93.4% despite 4.9 points of catastrophe losses, primarily related to Hurricane Helene. The underlying combined ratio of 91.2% improved 9.4 points compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement continues to be driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing and lower losses from physical damage coverages. This quarter's underlying underwriting -- this quarter's underlying result also included a 2 point benefit related to the re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year. Taking a step back, the year-to-date underlying combined ratio of 93.7% reflects considerable progress and is compelling evidence of our return to profitability in auto. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, it is important to remember that the fourth quarter auto underlying loss ratio has historically been about 6 points to 7 points above the average for the first-three quarters because of winter weather and holiday driving. In Homeowners and Other, the third quarter combined ratio of 91.5% improved by nearly 25 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of a lower underlying combined ratio, as well as lower catastrophe losses and higher favorable prior year development. Hurricane Helene and a severe convective storm in July drove catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 74.4% improved 13.6 points compared to the prior year quarter. Approximately three quarters of the year-over-year favorability was related to non-catastrophe weather and non-weather losses. The benefit of earned pricing also contributed to the improvement. Turning to production. Our results reflect our ongoing efforts to balance profitability and growth across the portfolio. We're pleased with our progress, as we execute a very granular state-by-state strategy. In domestic auto, retention of 83% remained strong. Renewal premium change of 12.8% continued to moderate as intended. Renewal premium change will continue to decline, reflective of improved auto profitability. Auto new business premiums continue to reflect our success in achieving positive auto growth in many states. While auto new business premium was down slightly in total, the decline reflects our focus on auto profitability in a few remaining challenging states and the cross-line impact of our actions to manage property exposure in high risk cat geographies. We're comfortable with this trade-off in the near term and remain confident in our ability to profitably grow our portfolio over time. In Homeowners and Other, retention of 85% and renewal premium change of 14.6% remained strong and consistent with recent quarters. We expect renewal premium change to generally remain at this level in the fourth quarter. As we intended, homeowners new business premium and policies in force continued to decline compared to the prior year quarter. Also, as we intended, the decline was most significant in high-risk catastrophe geographies, reflecting continued actions to reduce exposure and mitigate volatility through improved risk selection, restricted binding authority, tightened eligibility requirements and higher deductibles. To sum up for the Personal Insurance segment overall, this was a great quarter, reflecting disciplined execution by our team and further progress toward delivering a profitable growing portfolio of personalized business over time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thanks, Michael. We're happy to open up for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGregory Peters: Okay. Good morning, everyone. So I guess for the first question, I'll focus on domestic business insurance and the renewal premium change, which continues to be quite strong even through the third quarter. I guess, where I'm going with this is, given the strong improvement in the underlying results, at what point will that renewal premium change begin to moderate?\nAlan Schnitzer: Hey, Greg. Good morning. It's Alan. Thanks for the question. We're not going to try to forecast what that's going to be. But I would say, there are headwinds out there in terms of inflation. There is uncertainty out there in terms of the political and regulatory environment, the geopolitical environment, so on and so forth. So I'll share that with you as the kind of things we think some of the market is reacting to, but we're not going to project it.\nGregory Peters: Okay. Fair enough. I thought, I\u2019d give it a shot. I guess the other question, listening to the comments about the strong results, the best third quarter ever in business insurance, etc. and the free cash flow. I guess, I want to pivot back to capital management. I know you're not going to disclose M&A on the call, but it seems like a balanced approach, including capital return to shareholders and M&A, or investment in organic is a high likelihood that could happen. But considering the cash flow numbers, should we just plow that all on the share repurchase or what are you thinking?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah, Greg, I'll just tell you philosophically for every single dollar of capital that we generate, our first priority is to invest it back in the business in whatever way we can do that to create shareholder value. Whether that's organic growth, investing in talent or capabilities, products, etc., or whether it\u2019s inorganic. So that\u2019s our first objective, and we try to do that. But it\u2019s not our capital, it\u2019s investor capital, and we try to be very, very good stewards of shareholders\u2019 capital. And so we\u2019ve got a pretty high bar for what we do with that capital, and we don\u2019t think we can generate it back in the business and create a return, we\u2019re going to return it to shareholders.\nGregory Peters: Okay. Congrats on the results.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Thanks. Good morning. I sort of had a follow-up on the prior question on the BI renewal rate change. So it was good to see the acceleration quarter-over-quarter after its decelerated the past three quarters. I guess, I'm just wondering, Alan, if you could comment on how sustainable you feel like this rate environment is? And if you think the hurricanes over the last few weeks will change the trajectory on the property side, which I know is -- has kind of been a standout a drag on that RRC recently? And then just relatedly, how that impacts your appetite for growth within property, but also in liability lines where it's still an uncertain environment?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. So there's a lot there, David, let me start, and if I don't get to it, I\u2019ll follow-up. But in terms of pricing, I would say that we expect renewal price change continue to be positive and strong for all the reasons I shared in response to Greg's question, now whether that means it goes up a little bit from here or down a little bit from here, I don't really know. But I think the message we would give you for all those reasons is positive and strong. You mentioned you\u2019re -- the comment about property and that price weighing. I guess I would say, you got to take that property pricing together in connection with the return to the property line. So it's not like the returns are struggling and the price is falling. The price change in property is a reflection of the returns on that line. So it's totally rational and totally appropriate. We're not going to share our property pricing strategy, and we'll all just have to wait and see where the market goes on that. But clearly, these storms are a reminder of the potential volatility and the things that we've all got to be thoughtful about in committing capital to risk. Did I get that, David, anything I missed?\nDavid Motemaden: And then just on the -- it sounds like the liability lines in auto and umbrella the rates. It sounded like they accelerated a bit sequentially in the quarter. I'm just wondering, I guess, you guys have made the reserve changes last quarter. It didn't sound like there was any noise this quarter from -- post that. But just your comfort level in terms of leaning into growth in some of those lines?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. So I think we shared last quarter that even after the charge we took an umbrella, we were comfortable with the returns in umbrella even the last quarter and we remain comfortable with the returns. And again, we're going to execute on a very granular account by account basis. But given where the returns are, given \u2013 we\u2019ve shared before and we talked a lot about this last quarter, there\u2019s a real advantage to reacting quickly to loss cost trends and getting your view of pricing in order. And that gives us real confidence with the way we\u2019re executing in the marketplace today. So we do think in terms of both growth and profitability, there is a huge advantage to reacting quickly to loss trend.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. Your line is open.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, thanks. Good morning. This might be an easy answer, but I don't think I heard any call out of maybe one-time items are helping the underlying business insurance, the underlying loss ratio?\nDan Frey: Hey, Mike. It's Dan. That's right. It's pretty clean, pretty straightforward quarter, and really, we wouldn't call out anything that you need to adjust for.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Got it. Okay. For my follow-up, so I guess my follow-up be on personal lines. You have said in your prepared remarks that you are, I think, making some changes to deductibles, I believe. I guess, from a -- some of the super regionals are talking about kind of trying to overhaul their roughing with us -- basically the deductibles in a major way, increasing deductibles and maybe rough depreciation schedules or just a higher percentage deductible for rough replacement. Are you -- is Travelers taking more of a slower approach to that or are you making any kind of meaningful changes to your terms and conditions and personal lines in certain geographies?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Mike. It's Michael. I would say, yes, we're very active in making meaningful changes to our terms and conditions for property, particularly, in cat exposed geographies. It's really what I was referring to. When I talked about one of the drivers of the shrink and property is. And specifically, to your question about deductibles, we have moved -- in some states, we have deductibles that are dollar denominated, in other states, we have deductibles that are percentage. But we've made significant moves, particularly in cat exposed states in the Midwest. Along those lines, again, among the other things I mentioned, which are restricting eligibility, doing quite a bit of re-underwriting of the portfolio to really try to manage that exposure.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. I guess that would maybe change the way we need to think about modeling this maybe the loss ratio versus the cat ratio, but I guess, I think I'll follow up offline. Thank you.\nMichael Klein: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Cox from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRobert Cox: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. So obviously, on the renewal premium change, great numbers overall. I did just want to ask on Select. It looks like there was a little pressure on a little bit lower new business growth and retention, if I look back relative to a few quarters ago? I just wanted to ask on that?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Good morning, Rob. This is Greg. Yeah. As I shared with you in my comments, we're constantly optimizing our book of business in terms of getting the right equation between risk and reward. When you look at the webcast, first of all, 2023, we had some historical high retention number throughout that period. And we are -- similar to the question Mike just asked around deductibles, that's driven based on severe convective storm and a new peril that's been very dynamic and much more of a frequent weather event. And so, like, Michael and his team, our team in small commercial has also been fine-tuning that particular apparel and the coverage associated with that. And that's why we saw a little bit of the tick down in retention. I called that out in my prepared comments for you.\nRobert Cox: Got it. Thank you. And then, I just wanted to ask as a follow-up on just thinking about catastrophe losses, I don't think you guys provide an explicit guidance on this, but I was just curious, if you guys could give us any help in thinking about how we could size your annual expected catastrophe load? Any color or thoughts you could provide would be helpful?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yeah. Rob, good morning. It's Allan. In our proxy statement, we do give it admittedly for the prior year, so it won't give you the -- our current year view, but you can see the prior year. And one thing we've shared is, we\u2019ve had a couple of years now of pretty heavy cat losses is that we continue to factor those more recent years into our thought process, and we continue to weigh more recent years more heavily. And so that influences the way we think about cat loads going forward. We haven\u2019t yet given an outlook for cats.\nRobert Cox: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I think it kind of was addressed in one of the earlier questions, but can you just confirm, I guess, that no reserving action was taken with NGL in the quarter. You didn't call it out, so it sounds like there was nothing, but I just want to confirm that?\nDan Frey: Yeah, Elyse. It's Dan. So I'll reiterate what I said, which was -- so ex-asbestos in BI, we were favorable about $151 million that was driven by workers' comp. It wasn't entirely workers' comp. So there were some other lines that moved, but they were small amounts, and the net of that was a good guy as well.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you. And then my follow-up, my second question is on personal auto. When you guys -- the 93.7% year-to-date and recognizing like there is some seasonality in the Q4, but this puts you guys right at a good spot relative to kind of mid-90s, which is kind of what folks typically target on the auto side. So, is this like the sustainable run rate margin as we think about the business with rates slowing and just your view of overall loss trend within personal auto?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Elyse. It's Michael. I would say, certainly, the year-to-date result points you to a view that across the book, we're rate adequate. We're very pleased with the results and the returns. I shared that reminder again because it's pretty dramatic seasonality inside the book, and I just wanted to make sure that folks were aware of it. But broadly speaking, again, pleased with and really rate adequate across the book in auto at this point.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes. Thanks. I could just follow up on that one. If you're rate adequate across your book, should we start to expect that policy count is going to grow here in the near future?\nMichael Klein: Great question, Brian. It's Michael. We are hard at it, right? I tried to give you the pieces impacting auto growth as we sit here today. And again, in states where we don't have some of the other complications. We are seeing new business growth. And again, that's many states across the country. We're working hard at the states where we don't yet have adequate rates and we're making progress. But obviously, we're subject to those rates getting filed and approved before those flip into that category. But again, we're hard at work on that. And then the other element is the cross-line impact of our work to improve property risk reward, that will take some more time. But again, we're making strong progress there. And so again, as I've said the last couple of quarters, our focus in auto is to profitably grow it. Our focus in home is to improve profitability, given our focus on portfolio business, those two things kind of go hand in hand and that's what I mean when I say we're trying to balance growth and profitability across the book, but it's definitely a strong focus of ours.\nBrian Meredith: Appreciate it. And then one for Greg. I'm just curious, like, any kind of insight into what workers' comp pricing might look like going forward? I think we've -- you've heard that maybe a state or so, you might get some positive stuff out of ratings bureaus?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yeah, Brian. This is Greg. Yeah. If I look at workers' comp as a portfolio, I think we're going to see a continuation of what we're seeing right now. And that really is driven based on the strong experience on the line, and we certainly, as leaders in that line have demonstrated that. And so when you look at the bureaus and CCI being the largest one, what we're looking at for a forecast in 2025 for loss cost recommendation. It's very similar to what we saw in 2024. Of course, that doesn't apply to every individual account will have [indiscernible] and etc., on the individual account. But I think it's going to, kind of, stay with the levels that it\u2019s at right now.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Shanker: Yeah. More questions for Michael. Very popular today. I wanted to talk a little bit about, first, the favorable development in the Personal Lines segment. What years were it growing off the favorable development, and does that mean to some extent you may have overreacted on pricing in some states?\nDan Frey: Hey, Josh. It's Dan. So I'll start with the PYD story. Part of the PYD story, remember, the end of 2023 was really favorable in Personal Insurance and it was also brand new. The fourth quarter was terrifically strong from a profit perspective, it wasn't fully developed. We posted a really good number in the fourth quarter last year, but we were allowing for the uncertainty that where some of those claims are going to come later, were some of the ones that that did come, going to come with more severity. Nine months further on, we're just more confident. But if I look at the spread of accident years in Personal Insurance, favorable prior year reserve development. There is favorability in recent years. But if I look at the last 10 years, there is favorability in each and every one of the last 10 years. And I'll leave the pricing question for Michael.\nMichael Klein: Yeah. And Josh, I would say, in terms of did we overreact on pricing, again, I would reiterate the comment I made in response to a lease, which is, as we look across the book, we're rate adequate. And I'd also point you to the combined ratio for the year-to-date, if you add back prior year development to try to get to an accident year type number, that number is 97.4%. So I don't think that would be an indication that we've overshot.\nJoshua Shanker: That makes sense. And so we've had two quarters in a row now with about $170 million, $180 million of prior year favorable development in the Personal Lines segment. A lot of times, there's a certain trend and when that trend deviates throws off favorable development. But are these discrete things that you've noticed that make this degree of favorable development probably less likely to be sustainable if the trends continue or could we continue to see hundreds of million dollars of favorable development, if just the trends keep playing out? I hope, I'm asking the question appropriately.\nDan Frey: Yeah. Josh, it's Dan. I think I get it, and I'm glad you asked it. I mean, I think if there's two words that I would not put in a sense together, it's prior year reserve development and trend or run rate. And I think we tell you this pretty consistently. We look at all the data as it comes in every quarter. We do thorough reviews of every line every quarter. We're just trying to get it right. What you've seen probably in the last couple of years when loss costs were elevated in '22 and '23. We said we want to get it right. But in getting it right, we want to acknowledge the fact that if there's an elevated level of uncertainty we're going to contemplate that in our reserves. And now, if you've seen some of the inflationary pressures come back down to a more normal level, some of those years have matured and aged out, that's sort of what you're seeing. So you may or may not believe it, I literally don't have a view of whether prior year reserve development is going to be higher, lower or sideways in prior -- in PI in the next several quarters, but that's the way we think about it.\nJoshua Shanker: Thank you for the answers. Appreciate it.\nDan Frey: Thanks, Josh.\nOperator: And we have one more question, and that question comes from the line of Michael Phillips from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I want to go back to the BI casualty renewal price changes for a second. From another side, when you have gotten more rate today than last quarter, and then I hear your answers, Alan, about uncertainty and geopolitical risk and social and economic, we talked about stuff for years. I guess, when you're getting more rate today than last quarter, with such strong current core margins, does it mean element your concerns on those things that you answered are more today than they were last year or the year before when you started talking about them?\nAlan Schnitzer: Does it mean that we're more concerned about it. No, I -- the answers that you gave.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. That's the answer. That's the question. Are you more concerned today than maybe you were last year?\nAlan Schnitzer: I wouldn't say that we're more concerned today, you can't really think about this sort of static at a point in time. We're thinking about this looking out the windshield of the future and loss trend is certainly positive, and we'd like pricing to keep up with that. But I would not say that we're more concerned today. And I do think one thing you get with Travelers is pretty early detection and reaction to changes in loss activity. And so, I don't know where it's going to go, but we feel pretty good about the actions that we've taken so far this year.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Thanks. A quick one maybe for Jeff, perhaps. Any updates you can share with, I guess, loss trends in the management liability section? Thanks.\nJeffrey Klenk: Not specific to loss trend, no. I called out in the script for you, and again, this is Jeff Klenk, we said that the earned pricing had an unfavorable impact on the underlying combined ratio. I'd point out though that the pricing strategy is a function of rate adequacy. The returns in the business have been excellent. Our renewal pricing reflects deliberate execution and I feel great about the renewal retention percentage at 90%. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Abbe Goldstein for some final closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Thank you all for joining us this morning. I appreciate the questions. And as always, if there's any follow-up, please get in touch with Investor Relations. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the investor section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to have generated a strong bottom line result in the quarter that included a record number of severe convective storms across the United States. Excellent underlying results, favorable net prior year reserve development, and higher net investment income contributed to core income of $585 million or $2.51 per diluted share. Underlying underwriting income of $1.2 billion pre-tax was up 55% over the prior year quarter. This year's exceptional result was driven by record net earned premiums of $10.2 billion and a consolidated underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 87.7%. Net earned premiums were higher in all three of our business segments. The underlying combined ratio in our Business Insurance segment was an excellent 89.2%, and the underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business improved 1.7 points to a very strong 86.1%. Looking at our two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI, BSI underlying combined ratio was an outstanding 88.7% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance improved by nearly 8 points to a terrific 86.3%. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 8% to $11.1 billion in the quarter. Outstanding execution by our colleagues in the field across all three segments contributed to our top-line success. We are very pleased to report terrific production results in our commercial segments, where, as you've heard, margins are attractive. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 7% to more than $5.5 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.1%, while retention remained high at 85%. A combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and a marketplace that continues to be generally disciplined. New business increased 9% to a record $732 million, a reflection of the fact that our customers and distribution partners value the products and services that we offer and the experiences that we provide. In Bond & Specialty insurance, we grew net written premiums by 8% to more than $1 billion, driven by very strong retention of 90% in our high-quality management liability business, and excellent production in our market-leading surety business, where we grew net written premiums by 11%. At year-end 2023, we shared that across our two commercial segments, our E&S writings had reached $2.5 billion for the year, doubled the level from 2021. Year-to-date, we've grown E&S net written premiums by 16%. The margins continue to be quite attractive. In Personal Insurance, continued strong pricing drove 9% growth in net written premiums with growth of 10% in auto and 8% in home. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff, and Michael about our segment results. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating after-tax net investment income of $727 million, driven by strong and reliable terms from our growing fixed-income portfolio and higher returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our investment results benefit from the strong cash flow we've generated over a sustained period. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which we've generated more than $1 billion in operating cash flow. This isn't a measure that we or the industry talk a lot about, but it's important. Cash flow is what enables us to make strategic investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders, and grow our investment portfolio. Since 2016, we've invested $11 billion in important technology initiatives, returned more than $20 billion of excess capital to our shareholders, and grown our investment portfolio by more than $25 billion. It's a virtuous cycle as well-conceived and executed strategic initiatives, an effective capital management strategy, and a thoughtful investment strategy contribute to attractive returns and growth in adjusted book value per share. Strong underwriting is the flywheel that sets it all in motion. Thanks to exceptional franchise value and excellent marketplace execution, we've profitably grown our premium base from about $25 billion in 2016 to more than $40 billion today. Our growth over this period of time has been largely organic, selling products in which we have deep expertise through distribution partners with whom we have longstanding relationships, and in geographies where we have a thorough understanding of the regulatory environment and other market dynamics. In other words, our competitive advantages have enabled us to effectively execute a relatively low-risk growth strategy. The success of that strategy is evidenced by a return on equity that has averaged about 900 basis points over the 10-year treasury over that period at industry-low volatility. What all this boils down to is steady consistent growth and adjusted book value per share after making important investments in our business and returning substantial excess capital to shareholders. And as a leader in the US PNC market with broad product capability, demonstrated success with innovation and plenty of market share headroom, we're confident there's a lot more opportunity in front of us. To sum it up, we continue to be very confident in the outlook for our business. Our results for the first half of the year include strong premium growth, an excellent bottom line result, record operating cash flow, and steadily rising investment returns in our growing fixed income portfolio. With a strong and diversified business and balance sheet, we delivered 13.6% core return on equity over the last 12 months, despite substantial industry-wide catastrophe losses. With this momentum, we remain well-positioned for success this year and beyond. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. We're pleased to have generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an underlying combined ratio of 87.7%, a 340 basis point improvement from last year's strong result, and the third consecutive quarter below 88%. This led to one of our strongest ever underlying underwriting gains of $952 million after tax, up $337 million, or 55% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the second quarter was 28.8%, in line with our expectations and once again benefiting from the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. We continue to expect 2024's full year expense ratio to be 28% to 28.5%. As Alan mentioned, the industry experienced a very active cat quarter, and our second quarter results include $1.5 billion of pre-tax catastrophe losses, driven by a record number of severe convective storms. As disclosed in the significant events table in our 10-Q, we had five events surpass the $100 million mark in Q2, all in the month of May. Turning to prior year reserve development, we had total net favorable development of $230 million pre-tax. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $34 million resulted from approximately $300 million of better than expected loss experience in workers' comp across a number of accident years, largely offset by about $250 million of strengthening in general liability driven by Umbrella for accident years 2021 through 2023. In terms of the Umbrella line, these are very young accident years made up almost entirely of IBNR. While we will obviously continue to evaluate loss activity as it comes in, we believe we have been proactive and decisive in addressing the latest observed loss activity and adjusting our view of loss development factors to allow for the prospect of rising settlement costs and lengthening settlement patterns. Importantly, our picks for accident years 2015 through 2020 did not require much adjustment in the first half of this year. It's also worth noting that our returns in the Umbrella line for the impacted accident years remain attractive. As we saw five years ago, when we were the first to call out a change in loss levels tied to an increase in attorney rep rates, sharpening our view of loss costs early in the development of immature accident years and long tail lines positions us to enhance our risk selection, pricing, and claim strategies, ultimately setting us up to outperform in terms of growth and profitability. And on a related note, with court backlogs from the COVID shutdown now largely resolved, that element of uncertainty is, to a large degree, behind us. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD was $24 million pre-tax. Personal Insurance had significant net favorable PYD of $172 million pre-tax with good news from recent accident years in both home and auto. After tax net investment income of $727 million, increased by 22% from the prior year quarter. As expected, fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and higher invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also up from the prior year quarter. Our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, has increased slightly. We now expect approximately $675 million after tax in the third quarter and $695 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30th are still above the yields embedded in the portfolio. So fixed income NII should continue to improve beyond 2024 as the portfolio gradually turns over and continues to grow. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.7 billion were, again, very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Interest rates increased during the quarter and, as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased modestly from $3.7 billion after tax at March 31st to $4 billion after tax at June 30th. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $126.52 at quarter end, up 3% from year end, and up 10% from a year ago. We returned $498 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $253 million and dividends of $245 million. We have approximately $5.5 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors. Turning to reinsurance, Page 19 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1st reinsurance placements. We increased coverage when we renewed our Northeast property CAT XOL Treaty, which now provides $1 billion of coverage above the attachment point of $2.75 billion. A year ago, we purchased $850 million of coverage, and the attachment point was $2.5 billion. We also renewed the Personal Insurance hurricane cat excess of loss treaty for coastal exposure, which continues to provide 50% coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $2 billion. Recapping our results, Q2 was another quarter of strong premium growth, excellent underlying underwriting profitability, and continued growth in net investment income, all of which bode well for our future returns. Our ability to absorb $1.5 billion of pre-tax cat losses and still deliver $585 million of core income for the quarter is a testament to the overall strength of our diversified franchise and the fundamentals of our business. To give a little more color on that, underlying underwriting income has become an increasingly reliable and important component of our earnings power. Going back to the combination of Travelers in St. Paul, from 2005 through 2019, annual underlying underwriting income averaged $1.2 billion after tax. Our focus on profitable premium growth, which began accelerating around 2016, resulted in underlying underwriting income surpassing $2 billion for the first time ever in 2020. And we stayed above $2 billion through 2022. We then surpassed $3 billion in 2023. And through the first half of 2024, underlying underwriting income of just over $1.9 billion is up by 32% compared to the first half of 2023. In short, underlying underwriting income has become a significant and growing contributor to our ability to continue generating industry-leading returns with industry-low volatility. And now, for more color on each segment's results, I'll turn the call over to Greg to begin with a discussion of Business Insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter in terms of both top and bottom line results. Segment income was $656 million, up more than 60% from the prior year quarter, driven by prior year reserve development, higher net investment income, and higher underlying underwriting income. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 89.2%, our best second quarter result ever. For modeling purposes, property losses for this quarter were about a point favorable to our expectations. Net written premiums increased 7% to an all-time second quarter high of more than $5.5 billion. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.1% with renewal rate change of 6.5% driving the majority of the strong pricing. Retention remained excellent at 85% and new business was up 9% to a record quarterly high of $732 million. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change, which was double digits for the fifth quarter in a row. The strong pricing was broad-based with renewal premium change in every line other than workers' comp at or pretty close to double digits. In terms of pure renewal rate change, we're pleased that the exceptional granular execution by our field organization reflects and appropriately balances the current return profile and environmental trends for each line. In terms of sequential rate movement from the first quarter, CMP, auto, umbrella, and workers comp all increased. Umbrella and auto led the way with double-digit rate increases. Renewal rate change in our property line moderated, driven by the National Property business, reflecting strong returns after several years of substantial compounding rate and improvements in terms and conditions. Even with these strong pricing levels, retention was improved or flat in every line other than property, where some large accounts in our National Property business in particular traded away to the subscription market this quarter on terms we weren't willing to accept. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was exceptionally high at 12.3% with the renewal rate change of 5.3%, up a point and a half from the first quarter and more than 2 points from the second quarter of last year. Retention remained healthy but ticked down a bit from recent periods to 83% as we begin to purposely optimize our risk return profile in a couple of targeted geographies and classes. New business remains strong and increased 8% from the prior year quarter. We're pleased with the impact that our production, product, and platform initiatives are having in the marketplace and building a high-quality mix of business and driving profitable growth in this market. In middle market, renewal premium change remains strong and consistent with recent levels at almost 10%. Renewal rate change of 7% was up more than a point from the second quarter of last year and has now been at or around the 7% mark for the fourth consecutive quarter. Retention also remained strong at 89%. A new business of $383 million was the highest ever second quarter result. Lastly, fresh off my most recent round of field visits, I couldn't be more pleased with our team's execution, ideation, energy, and enthusiastic adoption of the tools and capabilities that have come from the strategic investments we've been making. And our distribution partners were once again crystal clear about our team's value and shared many examples of how our local teams, the best in the business, distinguished themselves. These trips continue to highlight for me the value of our high-performing talent in training curriculums, as well as the dividends we are receiving from our investments to be the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted another strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $170 million and a strong combined ratio of 87.7%. The underlying combined ratio improved 1.7 points to a very strong 86.1%. The underlying loss ratio improved 4.1 points to an excellent 46.4%, reflecting the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the prior year quarter from a small number of surety accounts. As we discussed last quarter, the expense ratio is modestly elevated primarily due to the Corvus acquisition. We expect that to continue to be the case for a few more quarters as we integrate the operation and as premiums from Corvus attractive book of business ramp up and earn in. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 8% in the quarter to a record high. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90% with positive renewal premium change that is generally consistent with recent quarters. We're pleased that we grew new business by nearly 60% from the prior year quarter to a record $111 million driven by Corvus. As a reminder, all of Corvus production will continue to be reflected in new business through next quarter. We grew net written premiums in our market leading surety business by a terrific 11% in the quarter, reflecting a robust construction environment and continued strong demand for our surety products and services. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter. And now, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, an excellent underlying underwriting result and strong net favorable prior year reserve development drove a significantly improved bottom line result relative to the prior year quarter, despite another period of elevated industry-wide catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 86.3% reflects nearly an 8 point improvement compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher earned pricing in both automobile and homeowners and other. Continued strong price increases in both auto and home drove 9% growth in net written premiums. In auto, we're pleased with another quarter of improved profitability and with the underlying fundamentals of the business. The second quarter combined ratio of 97.9% improved more than 10 points compared to the prior year quarter due to a lower underlying combined ratio as well as favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio improved more than 8 points, driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing and to a lesser extent lower losses from physical damage coverages. For modeling purposes, we view roughly 2.5 points of the improvement in the quarter as non-recurring. In homeowners and other, the second quarter combined ratio improved over 16 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting a lower underlying combined ratio, as well as higher favorable prior year development. While catastrophe loss dollars were similar to the prior year quarter, they had a smaller combined ratio impact as price increases continue to benefit earned premiums. Catastrophe losses this quarter, primarily resulting from severe convective storms, again significantly exceeded long-term industry averages. The 28 PCS designated cat events were the most ever for a second quarter and 150% of the historical 10-year average. Our catastrophe losses in the quarter were consistent with our market share. And for context, our average annual cat losses over the last five and 10 years remain below our market chart. This most recent experience will of course be reflected in our models going forward and we will continue to weigh our recent experience more heavily in our ongoing process of optimizing our exposure, underwriting, and pricing. The underlying combined ratio of 77.6% improved 7.6 points, due in large part to lower than expected fire and non-weather water losses, as well as the benefit of earned pricing. For modeling purposes, we expect approximately 5 points of the improvement in the homeowners and other underlying combined ratio to be nonrecurring. Turning to production, our results reflect the ongoing execution of a granular state-by-state strategy as we balance profitability and growth across the portfolio. In domestic automobile, retention of 82% remains strong. Renewal premium change of 15.8% continued to moderate as anticipated. Auto renewal premium change will continue to gradually decline, reflecting the improved profitability on the line. While new business premiums were higher than the prior year quarter in many states, new business premium in aggregate was down slightly relative to the second quarter of last year. This is the result of our continued efforts to manage auto profitability in a few remaining challenge states, as well as the cross-line impact resulting from some of our property actions, particularly in high-risk cat areas. Production results in homeowners and other reflect our focus to manage growth, while improving profitability. Renewal premium change increased sequentially to 15.1%, reflecting higher rate change, while retention remains strong at 85%. We expect renewal premium change to remain at this level through year end. As we intended, new business and policies enforced declined, reflecting our efforts to thoughtfully deploy capacity. To sum up for the Personal Insurance segment overall, we're pleased with our progress as we continue to deliver improved profitability. We're confident that the actions we've taken and continue to take will result in a profitable growing portfolio of personalized business over time. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Operator, we're ready to open up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Motemaden: Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on the moving pieces around reserves in Business Insurance. So just the $250 million of recent accident year umbrella charges. That comes after $100 million last quarter. So I guess I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on some of the more puts and takes and maybe give some confidence that you've put this behind you after the changes you made this quarter.\nDan Frey: Hey, David, it's Dan. So you're right. We've seen umbrella in the general liability lines require some strengthening in the last few quarters. As we said in prepared remarks, we think that we're being proactive in reacting early and being decisive in meaning that we're being reasonably comprehensive in a meaning -- by reacting in a meaningful way to what we're seeing. I think the confidence we have is two pieces. One is, we are reacting both to the changes in actual versus expected and allowing for longer development factors going forward on the very recent accident years. So for the most part, we haven't even seen these claims come in yet, but we are allowing for the fact that when claims come in, they're likely going to cost more and take longer to settle. And then I think importantly, the 2015 through 2020 period has held up pretty well, given the actions that we had taken through the end of 2023.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. And maybe also within Business Insurance, the underlying loss ratio, if I sort of adjust out the light non-cat weather this quarter and then in 2Q 2023, there still was around 50 basis points of improvement year-over-year on a clean basis. Could you talk about, I guess, what was driving that improvement? And especially given all these changes, was there any change to loss trend baked in there?\nDan Frey: Yes, David, it's Dan again. So I'll take that. So I'll start with the second part first. So every time we have an impact on PYD, we reevaluate, is that going to have an impact on current loss year, jump off point, or loss trend. We had said last quarter that we had added beginning last quarter some IBNR to the current accident year. So we had already taken some action. The changes that we made in PYD have some carry forward impact on the umbrella line, but there's puts and takes across a variety of lines. And when you blend them all together inside of Business Insurance, it did not result in a big movement. In terms of the overall movement in BI's underlying loss ratio, you've got the big parts. There's still some benefit from earned pricing. Greg called out the fact that property losses, other than cat, were about a point favorable than our expectations. Other than that, in any quarter, you're going to have a half a dozen things that move favorably or unfavorably from mixed to base year to the impact of reinsurance, and you're seeing the net of those things. Nothing significant in there in terms of those individual movements.\nDavid Motemaden: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I'm looking at the BI pricing trends, which the [RSE] (ph) decelerated by 40 basis points. Is that just due to property, given that select and middle markets did improve in the quarter?\nGregory Toczydlowski: At least. This is Greg. Good morning. Yes, you can see in the webcast the individual pieces of select and middle market. And select is up, and middle market is flat. And I did call out that National Property is the primary driver of that slight deceleration.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, great. And then just going back to the umbrella increase as well, can you give us a sense maybe just some more color by accident year? And then, maybe just a little bit more following up on David's question, like, what emerged, I guess, in the Q2 more than what you saw in the Q1 to think that you put this issue to bed that we're not going to be dealing with additional charges as we go through the balance of this year?\nDan Frey: Yes, Elyse, it's Dan. So I think it's a pretty narrow range. We're giving you that it's three accident years, 2021, 2022, and 2023. I don't really feel the need to break it apart between the three. And it's a little bit more of the same, right? Things have continued to come in a little higher, whether it's attorney rep rate or severity, jury awards, all of those things, lengthening of the tail. What we're doing this quarter is, again, both reacting to what did we see that came in differently than what we would have expected and adjusting the development factors that we're going to use going forward? And that's what we mean when we say we think we're being proactive and decisive in this quarter's action.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Yes, I just wanted to ask on the data surrounding the court backlogs, I thought that was interesting. The court backlogs are now resolved from the COVID shutdown. Could you give us a little more color on that? Are you referencing data for Travelers or is that external industry data?\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, Rob, good morning. It's Alan. That is really an evaluation of our own data. We think we probably have the market relevance to understand what's going on more broadly, but that's based on our view of our data.\nRobert Cox: Okay, got it. And the changes to reinsurance do you expect any impacts to the combined ratio at all or the underlying combined ratio from any of the movements there?\nDan Frey: Rob, it\u2019s Dan. So not really. Pricing was about in line with what we would have expected. I'll just remind you that although cost of reinsurance might have gone up a little bit, we're getting price increases on the direct side, so the margin impact is insignificant probably, if any.\nRobert Cox: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nGregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to, for my first question, focus on Slide 8 of your PowerPoint presentation. And what I'm focused on is your competitive positioning. If I look at the year-to-date top lines results, kind of seeing some movements that I'm surprised by. I guess seeing national accounts grow as much as they did on a year-to-date basis kind of seems like it's counterintuitive. You expect the larger account business to be more competitive. And then on the selective middle market, I kind of anticipate maybe that to be higher growth areas for you from a net premium written perspective. So maybe you can provide some colors on that topic.\nDan Frey: So Greg, it's Dan. I'll start, and maybe Greg will chime in. So national accounts, on a relative basis, in terms of its contribution to Business Insurance in total, not the biggest piece, and its large accounts. So how many you retain -- you could lose one account in a quarter and that has a big impact on retention. You could write one new big new piece of business. That's going to change the premium base. So I'd say two things about national accounts. One, we're really happy with the profitability of that book. Two, I'm not surprised to see the variability given: one, that it's a relatively small base; and that two, the accounts themselves tend to be big. In terms of selecting middle, look, we love the performance of both of those businesses. Greg did make comments in his script about some refinement of the way we're thinking about underwriting in small commercial. Middle market, margins are really good, 8% growth. We're very happy on how we focused on the balance of retention and price where we need it. But I don't know, Greg, anything to add to that?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes, Greg, maybe just start with the bigger picture, the total business. 7% is a really good result given the attractive margins in this business right now. And you pointed out some of the individual business units. When you look at them from quarter-to-quarter, a number of items can have some level of variation, including booking lags, reinsurance processing, things that Dan just referenced. But in terms of the aggregate results, I'd point you as close as they are, the quarter to year to date, I'd point you to the year to date number, as that's a better indicator of how we're feeling about the top line of the business right now.\nGregory Peters: Fair enough. I guess for my follow-up question, I'm going to pivot to the Personal Insurance segment. And Michael, I appreciate your comments about the challenge to the states and trying to get the right positioning and pricing for your auto product. One of the largest and most visible peers seems to be really gaining share at this moment in time in the personal auto space. And I guess, when I look at your policy for in-force count going down, both in the first and second quarter, I'm just curious if you think your competitive positioning in personal auto is consistent with what's going on in the marketplace.\nMichael Klein: Yes, Greg, I think it's a great question. I would say, to your point about is it consistent with what's going on in the marketplace, it's interesting. The one peer you're talking about is the one peer with those results, not everybody else inclusive of us. So I would take a step back first of all and say, certainly kudos to them and the results they're generating and the success that they're having, but it's really not us who's the outlier. And then underneath that, I think, again, I tried to detail it for you. We are having success in the geographies that I'll say are the ones that aren't noisy and generating new business growth in those places where we like the auto margins and we're not impacted by some of the property actions, number one. That growth is, if you just look at the auto line by itself, being hampered by those challenged geographies. And then I also think that it's important to think about the differences in our strategy and our book of business when you look at our auto growth numbers, right? We are predominantly a package writer of personal lines business. The competitor that's growing auto is not predominantly a package writer of personal lines business. And when you look at the challenge of geographies from a property standpoint and you look at the independent agent channel, what you find in the marketplace is that, in many of those geographies in order to write the property, the carrier is insisting on also writing the auto. And so, if you are a competitor that's less dependent on auto business that brings property with it, you're not as challenged by those marketplace dynamics in those high-risk property geographies. So those are -- I think those are some of the things that explain the differences. But again, I would come back and say we're very pleased with our ability to generate auto new business growth in the places where we're not challenged by those factors. The other thing is, if you were to look underneath the new business growth numbers, first of all, you can see in aggregate auto new business growth is much better than property new business growth. And particularly, in those challenged geographies from a property standpoint, our auto new business is down, but it's not down nearly as much as the property new business in those geographies.\nAlan Schnitzer: And Greg, I would just point out at a very high level. Michael points out some distinguishing characteristics of our Personal Insurance business, there are some significant benefits from that business model. I mean, obviously, it's having the impact it's having on growth, but there are some significant offsetting benefits to that business model, and we're well on the way to sorting this out.\nGregory Peters: Got it. Thank you very much for the detailed answers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [Jimmy Bueller] with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning. So first just had a question on just your cat losses. Given changes we've seen in the reinsurance market the last year and a half, should we assume that you're going to be absorbing higher levels of cats going forward, or is the high number that you posted this quarter, same quarter last year as well, more of a function of the type of events you have seen.\nDan Frey: Yes, Jimmy, it's Dan. So, if you look at the reinsurance detail we gave at the January 1 renewals and now again at July 1 renewals, we're not really holding onto more. We tend to buy more tail coverage on big cat events. The attachment points have gone up, but the attachment points have gone up naturally as a result of the growth in the premium base and the growth of the insured values. So what's coming through our net result is not really any impact from less use of reinsurance.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then just for Michael, can you talk about just competitor behavior in the personal auto line, both in terms of pricing and then advertising spending by some of the larger peers?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Jimmy. I would say, in terms of pricing, we continue to see renewal premium changes and price changes working their way into books of business across the industry similar to what we're seeing. I do think it's important when you look at our renewal premium change number though, to distinguish between what's coming through renewal premium change and the rate that's being filed for go-forward business, right? What you're looking at when you look at our renewal premium change number and many renewal premium change numbers across the industry is the lagged effect of the rate that's already been taken. When we look at filing activity for ourselves and for others, you see a much less significant amount of rate filing this time this year than you would have seen this time last year. And so again, what you're seeing in renewal premium change in auto is the lagged impact of that. In terms of your question about advertising, certainly we see increased advertising amongst some of our competitors who are big advertisers across the industry. In marketplaces where we bid for demand, where we bid for leads. We see the prices of those leads going up. That's reflective of that increased advertising spend and that increased appetite for leads. But I think that both of those things, I think, demonstrate that what you're seeing is improved profitability in auto across the industry and a pivot towards profitable growth very consistent with the conversation and the messaging that we're sharing.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Shanker with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Shanker: Yes, thank you very much. I guess for Michael, you're right to point out that the property declines are greater than the auto declines. I'm wondering if you can talk about whether there's non-renewals of customers who you no longer want given their geographies or whether it's pricing actions that are driving those customers away? When we look at the policy count changes in homeowners, what's driving them?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Josh. The biggest driver of the policy count decline in homeowners is the reduction in new business. You see where the retention holding relatively steady. And so for the most part, new business production being down is what's driving the [PIF] (ph) decline. I'll also say that, sort of consistent with my comments earlier, the new business reduction in the cat challenged states is down more significantly than the new business reduction you see in the production highlights as we work to manage the distribution of our property exposure. There is some limited non-renewal activity that I would say is really twofold. One is normal course, good hygiene, evaluating the worst performing risks in the portfolio and taking action on them. The other is, some targeted non-renewals, again, as we manage the geographic distribution of our exposures and manage growth in some higher concentration, higher cat geographies. But again, those actions are all intentional and the new business reductions, as I said in my prepared remarks, really are as intended as part of our efforts to improve profitability.\nJoshua Shanker: And then a quick question on catastrophe. It's been quite a decade in terms of catastrophe losses. While you've made changes over time, you were a cat [indiscernible] pretty consistent. You like the risk and you only have protection really at the top for very extreme events. A broken clock is right twice a day in hindsight 2020, but looking at the last 10 years, has the cat program at Travelers been the most efficient use of your capital? And when you revisit, say that this is exactly what we need to do for the next 10 years?\nAlan Schnitzer: Josh, I think we're very comfortable with being a net underwriter. We think that we've got the data, the analytics, the culture to manage this the right way. And you can't expect a reinsurer to take on losses without conveying a margin to them. And so, when we look at the strength of our underwriting, we think that there's a real advantage for us in being largely a net underwriter.\nJoshua Shanker: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\nRyan Tunis: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question, a couple parts on casualty. First of all, I guess with what you're seeing in Umbrella, is it safe to assume that the underlying cause of a lot of those losses you're seeing is mostly auto-related? That's the first part. And then the second part, I remember like six years ago in 2019, you guys experienced some of this earlier than others. Is there something about your small middle market, your writing lower limits, that there's a little bit less of a tail. So just to make sure your business kind of experiences some of the inflationary impacts you've seen from 2021 to 2023 faster.\nAlan Schnitzer: Hey Ryan, let me start there. So in terms of what we're seeing, no, it's not -- actually not a predominantly auto issue. This is a combination of economic inflation and social inflation driving claim activity into the Umbrella line in short. And economic inflation sort of speaks for itself. Social inflation, it's an aggressive plaintiff's bar. It's third-party litigation funding. It's sympathetic jury. It's the exact same constellation of factors we've been talking about, just a little bit more pronounced. In terms of our ability to see it sooner, I honestly don't think it's a function of our book of business or our limits or anything else. I think it's a function of our data, our analytics, and really importantly, our culture. We've got a culture that looks for this, that sees it. We've got a very, very important and very valuable feedback loop among our claims professionals, our pricing actuaries, our reserving actuaries, and our underwriters that can put together a story very, very quickly. And it's actually a competitive advantage. As Dan highlighted in his prepared remarks, the ability to sharpen a view of lost costs very, very early in the life of immature long-tail lines is a huge advantage. It's a difference on whether you're subject to adverse selection or inflicting adverse selection. And we think this positions us very well. Again, it's very, very early. These years are predominantly IBNR. And the returns that we're looking at in those years actually continues to be very attractive. So I get the interest in it. Believe me, we're interested in it, too. But our ability to see this and react to it really is a competitive advantage for Travelers.\nJoshua Shanker: Got it. Then I guess just to follow up. I think Greg mentioned lower retention in select accounts. I heard the word geography. I mean, to the extent that you are seeing elevated cats in commercial lines, I'd be curious if you guys think you are. Is that more of a small commercial issue or if not, is it kind of more middle market or a national account?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Hey, Ryan, this is Greg. Yes, we're not seeing cats disproportionately across any of the business units in Business Insurance. And it's just our normal good housekeeping and selected that we're going through and looking at the book of business and understanding parts of it where we need to get a better risk return profile. And folks certainly aren't going to share the individual geographies as that's market sensitive, but that's what's going on underneath that statement.\nAlan Schnitzer: It's the kind of optimizing we do in every business every day.\nJoshua Shanker: Understood. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nBrian Meredith: Hey, thanks. I only have a couple of quick questions here. First one, there was some legislation in Florida, I guess, that passed in June that talked about Medicare reimbursement rates to doctors that will affect workers' comp. I'm just curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about how that would affect comp, pricing and loss cost severity trends. And is that something you see continuing throughout the US?\nAlan Schnitzer: Brian, what I would say about workers' comp loss trend is that, we continue to look at it based on long-term basis and frequency and severity both continue to emerge favorable to our expectations. So there's nothing we're seeing out there that's necessarily adversely impacting that perspective, but it's a long-tailed line and we're going to have a lot of respect for the duration of the liability.\nDan Frey: And Brian, in terms of any specific state change that you mentioned, our product managers are looking at that at the state level. They're estimating what some of the bills and changes are. And we factor that in the pricing over time as we see those trends come in. So if there's a new reg out there and we think it's meaningful, we certainly are going to take an estimate at that and how it plays out in the marketplace.\nBrian Meredith: Terrific. Thanks. And Alan, second question is, you all have seen some great growth in your E&S capabilities and clearly seems like you're building those out. I'm just curious, you've typically been known as kind of the largest standard commercial and admitted market player in the US. Why kind of the sudden change, or not sudden change, but that kind of gradual change in strategy here toward more focus on the E&S markets? And do you think this continues here for the Travelers that E&S will become a larger and larger percentage of your overall, call it, commercial business mix?\nAlan Schnitzer: So Brian, we are predominantly a standard lines writer and we will continue to be that for the foreseeable future. We're not changing any stripes here and we've had substantial E&S capability for a very long time. So, for a long time a lot of our National Property business has been written on E&S paper. We've got our Northfield E&S business. We've got our Lloyd's business, some of what we do, in our Bond & Specialty business is written on E&S paper. So it's been a capability that we've had for a long time. And there have been ebbs and flows of business in and out of E&S for a long time. And so, part of this is what's been flowing into it and our ability to capture it. In addition, as we've seen an attractive E&S opportunity, we've leaned into it a little bit. So think what we've done with Fidelis and our acquisition of Corvus, and those have been contributors too. So this isn't a changing of strides by any stretch of the imagination, but there's an opportunity out there and we're participating in it at very attractive margins.\nBrian Meredith: Great, helpful. Thank you.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thanks and good morning. I guess first question, I'm not sure who this is best sent to, but does the Supreme Court overturning the Chevron doctrine, how does that impact exposure for various casualty lines?\nAlan Schnitzer: I don't really know how to answer that, to be honest, Meyer. And we'll see over time whether there's any significant impact at all from Chevron. I mean, I hesitate to speculate on that at all and maybe it depends on who the regulators are in place and how that changes from one administration to the next. But I'm trying to decide whether I want to answer this off the top of my head or not, because it's not something that we've really rung our hands over. But if you imagine that regulatory activity is a contributor to loss activity, the impact of that decision on the Chevron document, you'd expect might be a good guy, frankly. But I think it's too early for us to make that call.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, fair enough. The second question, I guess, this is for Michael. When you look at the sort of potential outcomes for non-catastrophe weather and catastrophe losses, do you think of those as being inversely related or unrelated?\nMichael Klein: Meyer, I think it depends on the quarter. The non-cat weather in Personal Insurance sometimes will see a benefit because much of the weather gets classified as a cat. That actually was the case in the second quarter of last year. That was less so the case this year. When we talked about the underlying result this quarter, I talked about the fact that it was really fire and non-weather water losses, just to put a point on it and really didn't talk about non-cat weather, because in this quarter, it really -- we had both elevated catastrophes and we had about what we expected from a non-cat weather standpoint. So, in some cases, you'll see a little bit of an inverse relationship depending upon sort of the footprint of the weather and how significant the events are. But they're not always inversely related or directly related for that matter.\nGregory Toczydlowski: I mean, it was a little bit of a factor of force this quarter in Business Insurance. Not huge, but it did have that impact this quarter. And so, when we do think about our weather, obviously, we're managing it as one, but there's a lot of what we would report favorably or unfavorably in small weather that you would see in the catastrophe line of some of our peers.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that's perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski with BMO. Please go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just stepping back and thinking about the competitive environment in commercial lines, maybe a little more focused on Business Insurance, but maybe not. Would you expect current pricing power trends and maybe for the industry to kind of be stable? Or would you expect kind of an upward sloping trend if indeed Travelers is kind of ahead of others in terms of being proactive on loss trends, especially on the casualty side.\nAlan Schnitzer: Mike, I think we're going to try very hard not to give outlook on pricing. But I will say that from here, we would expect renewal price change continue to be positive and strong and in particular, driven by casualty. Now, whether that means up a little bit or down a little bit in one line or another. I don't really know. But I would say we expect it to remain relatively strong. There's a lot of uncertainty out there and you've heard from others about their experience in the casualty lines. As we look at the schedule P's, honestly, we expect there to be more of that coming from the industry. When we look at our position relative to the industry position, we would expect there to be more coming from the industry. So I would say positive and strong, particularly driven by casualty.\nMike Zaremski: Got it. Quick follow-up, and I wish there was a live transcript if there's not because of this global IT issue, but I feel Dan, you made some prepared remarks that were a bit longer and you talked about kind of underlying profitability and consistency. Is there can you unpack what was the -- what was the message you were trying to convey to us and investors? Are you trying to tell us to focus kind of more on the underlying loss ratio and less on kind of PYD levels or am I misunderstanding what you meant by that?\nAlan Schnitzer: Mike, so thanks for listening. I think the main gist was sort of there was a period of time where underlying underwriting income was a pretty steady level. And it was a long period of time. And that was a period of time when written premium growth was sort of ticking around low single digits for a fair amount of time. And then when we started to accelerate the rate of top line growth again around 2016, and did it at consistent margins. The point was, that just translated into a much bigger base of pretty reliable underlying underwriting income. You can't quite go so far as to say it's just going to come in like the tide, but you look at the last five years where we -- before 2020, we had never reached $2 billion in after-tax underlying underwriting income. We crossed $2 billion in 2020 and stayed there. Then we crossed $3 billion in 2023. And in the first half of the year, we're up 30-something percent compared to that. So it was -- I sometimes think that people don't think of us as having grown, but really the underlying earnings power of the franchise is just in a completely different ballpark than it was five or six years ago.\nDan Frey: And that's the important point, Mike. When you look at the various things that impact the bottom line, underlying underwriting income has been a much bigger, much more reliable contributor to that. And when you think about the earnings power of the Travelers, that's an important contributor. And, well, I'll leave it at that.\nMeyer Shields: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question, and that question comes from [Bob Hwang] with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. Just maybe on workers comp a little bit. Obviously, California's benchmark rate decreased by 2%. As we think about more and more people go back to work, cost of medical inflation going up, can you maybe talk about the dynamics between your pricing, your severity as well as your frequency and how we should think about the $300 million relief this quarter and then also just the overall reserving position for the book on workers comp.\nAlan Schnitzer: So a lot there Bob and I'm not -- honestly, I'm not sure what the question is. The workers comp book continues to be extraordinarily attractive. We are the market leader and very good at it. We like the business. We like the returns. We feel great about the balance sheet position. I mean, if there's a specific question there, let me know so we can be responsive.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, sorry. Maybe it got cut off. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of, given where the rates are, given where medical cost inflations are going, which is increased, right? And given that frequency, or at least from the fact that more and more people are going back to the office, should we expect frequency to go up? Should we expect severity to go up from here? How do you think about after you take the $300 million of workers' comp reserve release this quarter, how should we think about just the ongoing reserve position of that book? That's where I'm trying to get to.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes. So, I mean, we've had favorable development in the workers' comp line for many, many, many quarters now. And I don't know what it's going to be next quarter or the quarter after that, but I can tell you that we continue to feel positively about the balance sheet reserves sitting behind the workers' comp book. In terms of frequency and severity, look, frequency has been on a long-term secular decline. And, again, we're not going to project where that's necessarily going, but it's been on a long-term secular decline that the pandemic and the work from home that's followed it, it's probably too early to make a call on it, but at the margins, that's been probably positive. And if people came back to work and it ticked up a little bit, that wouldn't be particularly troubling for us because as we think about where frequency and severity go from here, as we've always done given the duration of the liability, we are very respectful of those two things. And so we continue to book frequency and severity as if it's going to go back to long-term trends. And so, we feel fine about the line and where lost trend is and where it could go.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay got it. If I can just sneak into the last one. We've all around that New Jersey homeowner price. I know that pricing was up significantly. Just curious as to what the rationale about the New Jersey's homeowner pricing increase, if there is any.\nAlan Schnitzer: You're asking about New Jersey Homeowner price increases?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, sir.\nAlan Schnitzer: I mean, pricing in homeowners broadly is up, driven by rate. New Jersey is actually been a challenging place from a homeowners pricing standpoint. And it's one of the reasons we're actually dramatically shrinking the book of business in that state. And it's really driven by the loss environment. So, New Jersey is been, again, a challenging environment from a loss standpoint, and the regulatory challenges there are really the driver of our need to shrink that book. If we could get approval for the rate that we think we need then we'd be happy to write business there, but right now the regulatory dysfunction is a significant challenge.\nUnidentified Analyst: Really appreciate that. Thank you very much.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein for closing comments.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you very much for joining us. And as always, if there's any follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Have a good day.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."}, {"symbol": "TRV", "quarter": 1, "year": 2024, "date": "2024-04-17 12:47:07", "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the First Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 17, 2024. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers discussion of our first quarter 2024 results. We released our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment presidents; Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\nAlan Schnitzer: Thank you, Abbe. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report excellent top and bottom line results for the quarter. Core income was $1.1 billion or $4.69 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 15.4%. After-tax core income increased by $126 million, despite a $211 million one-time tax benefit in the prior year quarter. On a pre-tax basis, this year's core income was $413 million or 45% higher year-over-year. Strong core income is driven by record net earned premiums of $10.1 billion up 14% compared to the prior year period and an excellent combined ratio 93.9%. The combined ratio improved 1.5 points notwithstanding elevated catastrophe activity primarily in the central and eastern regions of the United States. The underlying combined ratio improved 2.9 points to an outstanding 87.7% driven by strong underlying results in each of our three segments. Looking at the two commercial segment together, the aggregate BIBSI [ph] underlying combined ratio wasn't excellent 88.8% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in personal insurance was 86.1% a 6.8 point improvement over the prior year. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio continue to perform well generating after tax net investment income of $698 million for the quarter driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and higher returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share after returning $620 million of excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and making important investments in our business, as we notched another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. In recognition of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our board of directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.05 per share marking 20 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 8% over that period. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 8% to $10.2 billion in the quarter. All three segments and excellent execution by our colleagues in the field contributed to our top line success. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 9% to $5.6 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.6%, our retention remained high. The combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and a marketplace that continues to be generally disciplined in the face of persistent headwinds. The segment generated a very strong $691 million of new business in the quarter, a reflection of the fact that our customers and distribution partners value the products and services that we offer and the experiences that we provide. In Bond & Specialty Insurance we grew net written premiums by 6% to $943 million. That was driven by strong retention of 90% and record new business in our high quality management liability business along with excellent production in our market leading surety business, where net written premiums were up 15%. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. In Personal Insurance, continued strong pricing drove 9% growth in net written premiums. Renewal premium change was 16.6% in our auto business and 13.4% in home. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll share that more than a hundred of my Travelers colleagues and I just returned from our Travelers leadership conference, TLC as we call it. It's a multi-day event that we host every year for the principals and senior leaders of our most significant distribution partners. Most of our guests have been coming for years, some for decades. We're also pleased every year to host a number of first timers. The represented firms are industry leaders and collectively account for more than half of our premium volume. We all returned home with the continued confidence that our relationships with these business partners and their firms are as strong as ever. We confirm that they remain very supportive of the strategic initiatives that we have underway and we took away valuable feedback on how we can accomplish even more together. The independent agent and broker channel remains a robust and growing part of our industry. At Travelers, we proudly partner with more than 15,000 agent broker firms across their 35,000 locations. We're a top three market for the majority of these firms that's a critical advantage because distributors place a disproportionate amount of their business with their top few carriers. We don't take these relationships for granted. As we've shared before, the vision for innovation agenda includes optimizing our value proposition as an indispensable partner to our agents and brokers. We continue to make significant investments to ensure that we realize that vision by offering best-in-class products, services, and experiences. Case in point, in our Bond & Specialty business, we recently conducted a blind survey of agents and brokers, ours and others, to determine how we ranked on the 10 attributes they identified as most likely to impact their placement decisions. Among our key competitors, we ranked first or tied for first in each of the 10 categories. We are over and over again that Travelers deep specialization across a wide range of modernized, simplified, and tailored products, along with a broad and consistent appetite are major differentiators for us in the market. For example, in Business Insurance, we offer a wide variety of coverages and product solutions. Admitted and DNS, across industries representing more than 85% of domestic GDP. Everything from a bought product for a local florist to a package solution for a main street middle market account to a loss sensitive workers compensation for a large national account. Across our three business segments, our distribution partners generally don't need to go to multiple carriers to satisfy customers' insurance needs. And the more lines per account we write, the higher the lifetime value of the customer. The primary focus of ours has been digitizing the value chain, in part to create value and provide great experiences for our agents and brokers, and in part to create efficiencies for them and for us. I'll share a few examples. In Business Insurance, we believe we were the first to offer agents and brokers a comprehensive portfolio loss data exchange, which allows us to digitally transfer to a small commercial or middle market distributor, loss information on their entire book with us. This capability enables our distribution partners to efficiently develop important insights into their books of business and supports their marketing efforts. In our middle market business, we believe we were the first carrier to offer multi-line digital submission capabilities. In our small commercial business, agents can transact with us through APIs or through our new quote and issue platform Travis, which is reduced quoting time by 25% for our leading BOP product. Across Business Insurance, nearly all of our largest distributors are currently leveraging one or more of our digital capabilities. In Personal Insurance, earlier this year, we added our proprietary aerial image reviewer to our agent portal. This advanced capability integrates a high resolution, over time photo series of a home into agents quoting workflow. This gives our partners a bird's eye view, helping them to better understand the customers or prospects insurance needs and how they may have evolved. We bring our franchise value directly to agents and brokers through distribution, underwriting, sales and claim professionals in more than 80 local offices. Through our expansive and empowered field organization, we foster deep relationships with our partners and are well-positioned to deliver the strength and expertise of travelers at the local level. We're also investing in our distribution partner\u2019s workforces by providing education and training programs to their up and coming producers. Our Flagship Travelers agency leadership program and agency producer school provide in-person training to invited participants. We also offer larger virtual programs that have trained thousands of producers, including more than 3,000 just last year. We remain deeply committed to our vision of being the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner to our agents and brokers. Our pole position with this, with leading distributors is a significant competitive advantage and one that's hard to replicate. To sum it up, the year is off to a terrific start with strong profitability and production in all three segments, as well as higher investment income. In short, we're firing on all cylinders. We also continue to invest in important strategic initiatives. We have demonstrated success in executing our innovation strategy, which has contributed to superior returns with industry low volatility, both in our premium base and higher adjusted book value per share. With this momentum and the best talent in the industry, we remain well positioned for success this year and beyond. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\nDan Frey: Thank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter increased by 13% to $1.1 billion. And core return on equity was 15.4%. The growth in core income was driven by higher net investment income, and despite the one-time tax benefit in the prior year that Alan mentioned, higher underlying underwriting income, partially offset by a higher level of catastrophe losses. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $1.2 billion was up 50% from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio that improved by 2.9 points to 87.7%. The underlying combined ratio was among our best ever and featured continued strong results in both Business Insurance and bond and specialty, complemented by a strong result in personal insurance, reflecting another quarter of significant improvement. We were pleased with the first quarter expense ratio of 28.7%, which was flat year-over-year despite the impact of Corvus, for which we had a full quarter of expenses, but very little earned premium, as there was no unearned premium carried in from the closing of the transaction on January 2nd. For the full year, we remained comfortable with an expense ratio expectation of 28% to 28.5%. We reported net favorable prior year reserve development of $91 million pre-tax in the first quarter. There was no net prior year reserve change in Business Insurance, as favorable development and workers comp of nearly $100 million was largely offset by modest increases for liability coverages in recent accident years, along with modest charges in our runoff book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $24 million pre-tax was driven by better than expected results across multiple lines. Personal Insurance recorded net favorable PYD of $67 million pre-tax, with improvements in both auto and home. After-tax net investment income increased 25% from the prior year quarter to $698 million. Fixed income NII was higher than in the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations, benefiting from both higher levels, higher yields, and a higher level of invested assets. Returns in our non-fixed income portfolio were also up from last year's quarter. Our updated outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, is $640 million after-tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $665 million in the third quarter, and then to around $690 million in the fourth quarter. Regarding income taxes in the first quarter, recall that last year's quarter included a one-time tax benefit of $211 million related to the repeal of Internal Revenue Code Section 847, and that's the main reason you see a higher effective tax rate in this year's quarter. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.5 billion were again very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. As interest rates increased during the quarter, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.1 billion after-tax at year-end to $3.7 billion after-tax at March 31st. Remember, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high, and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus, or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $125.53 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end, and up 8% from a year ago. Share repurchases this quarter included $250 million of open market repurchases. We had an additional $138 million of buybacks in connection with employee share based compensation plans. We have approximately $5.8 billion remaining under prior board authorizations for share repurchases. Dividends were $232 million in the quarter, and as Alan mentioned earlier, our board authorized a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.05 per share. In summary, the quarter's strong results once again demonstrate the significant earnings power of our ability to grow premiums across our well-diversified book of business while maintaining very attractive margins, along with steadily increasing net investment income from our growing and fixed income portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for discussion of Business Insurance.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance continues to deliver exceptional results with a strong first quarter of 2024 in terms of both the top and bottom lines. Segment income of $764 million was up from the first quarter of 2023 driven by higher net investment income and higher pre-tax underlying underwriting income. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 89.2% among our best ever. Net written premiums increased 9% to an all-time quarterly high of $5.6 billion. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.6% with renewal rate change of 7% driving most of the strong pricing. Retention remained excellent at 86% and new business of $691 million was an all-time first quarter high. Let me give you a little more texture on the continued strong pricing environment. Renewal rate change remained high, coming in at 7% or higher for the fourth quarter in a row. It was also up almost 2.5 points from the first quarter of 2023. In our select and core middle market businesses, renewal rate remained consistent with the fourth quarter. Renewal rate change in our national property book was strong and in the double digits, but down a couple points sequentially. That's an appropriate result threading the needle between healthy returns in the business and continued weather volatility. From a line perspective, umbrella, property, and auto led the way. All with renewal rate change in or very close to double digits. Renewal rate change was higher compared to the preceding and prior year quarters in GL, Umbrella, Auto, E&CMP [ph]. In workers' comp, renewal rate change was about half a point more than negative than the preceding and prior year quarters. With continued healthy exposure, renewal premium change in comp continues to be positive in the low single digits. Again, an appropriate result given the strong results in the line. Retention remained healthy across the board. We're pleased with our production results, the exceptional granular execution by our field organization, and the resulting growth in top line and attractive margins. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remains strong at 10.4% with renewal rate change of 4%, consistent with the fourth quarter and up more than two points from the first quarter of 2023. Retention also remained strong at 84%, while new business increased 22% from the prior year quarter to $156 million, driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. We're also encouraged with the impact we're seeing from Travis, our new front end rate, quote, and issue interface platform that Alan mentioned. In middle market, renewal premium change was 10% with renewal rate change of 7%, consistent with the strong fourth quarter result and up close to three points from the prior year quarter. Retention remains strong at 87%. To sum up, Business Insurance had a great start to the year. We continue to grow our profitable book while investing in capabilities to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Klenk: Thanks, Greg. Fund & Specialty started the year with another quarter of strong returns in our 29th consecutive quarter of profitable net written premium growth. Segment income was $195 million, driven by strong earned premiums and a combined ratio of 84.5%. Underneath the combined ratio, the underlying loss ratio improved 2.7 points to an excellent 46.4%. As Dan mentioned, the expense ratio was elevated compared to recent periods, primarily due to the Corvus acquisition. We expect that to continue to be the case for the next several quarters as we integrate and earn in Corvus' business. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 6% in the quarter. In our high quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90% with slightly higher sequential renewal premium change. We grew new business by 34% from the prior year quarter to a record $91 million, driven by Corvus production. As a reminder, we are in the midst of transitioning Corvus' $200 million profitable book of business onto Traveler's paper, which will continue to be reflected in our new business production in the coming quarters. Net written premiums in our market-leading surety business grew a terrific 15%, reflecting continued strong demand for our surety bonds. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Klein: Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report Personal Insurance generated first quarter segment income of $220 million and a combined ratio of 96.9%, both of which are significantly improved relative to the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 86.1% reflects a 6.8 point improvement compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned pricing in both automobile and homeowners and other. Net written premiums grew 9% as a result of continued price increases in both auto and home. In automobile, the first quarter combined ratio of 94.6% improved 10 points compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a lower underlying combined ratio, as well as favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 94.9% improved 8.5 points compared to the prior year, driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing. At the same time, vehicle severity trends moderated, and the quarter also included a modest frequency benefit from the mild winter. As a brief reminder, the first quarter underlying combined ratio is typically our seasonally lowest in auto. We are very pleased with the trajectory of auto profitability. In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 99.1% was impacted by higher catastrophe losses, reflecting an active cat quarter, with 19 PCS designated events for the industry, more than 50% higher than the long-term average. The underlying combined ratio of 77.6% improved 5 points, primarily driven by the impact of earned pricing. Turning to production, our results demonstrate continued disciplined execution of rate and non-rate measures to balance profitability and growth. In domestic automobile, retention of 82% remained strong, and renewal premium change of 16.6% was consistent with our expectations. Given the improving profitability of our book, we continue to expect renewal premium change to moderate throughout 2024. New business premium was consistent with the prior year quarter. Underneath this headline number, new business volumes grew in states where we have achieved written rate adequacy. In homeowners and other, retention of 84% remained strong and was consistent with recent quarters. Renewal premium change of 13.4% reflected higher renewal rate change, and was consistent with our expectations, as we have largely closed the gap in insurance to value. We expect renewal premium change to remain at these levels throughout 2024, as we continue to seek rate in response to elevated loss costs. The declines in homeowners' new business and policies in force reflect our ongoing efforts to thoughtfully deploy capacity, as we continue to manage rate adequacy, catastrophe risk, and regulatory risk. Personal Insurance team has made notable progress on improving the underlying fundamentals of our business, while sustaining investments in key capabilities for the future. We're moving closer to our goal of delivering target returns. Auto profitability continues to improve. We have reached written rate adequacy in all but a few states, and are continuing to temper non-rate actions accordingly. For homeowners, we remain focused on managing growth, while improving profitability. At the same time, we're delivering key strategic capabilities. In February, we completed two noteworthy product launches, Quantum Boat 2.0 in the U.S., and Optima Home in Canada. Quantum Boat 2.0 delivers a better agent and customer experience, with improved segmentation, and strengthens our position as a provider of total account solutions, building on the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 and Quantum Home 2.0. Optima Home is an extension of our market-leading Quantum Home 2.0 property product, enabling us to deliver a more robust total account solution in the Canadian market. Both product launches mark further progress on our journey to modernize our products and platforms, making us an even more compelling choice for customers and distributors. To sum it up, I'm very pleased with the positive start to the year in Personal Insurance and grateful to our team. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abby. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you. We're ready to open up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question just on the more recent accident year reserve increases in Business Insurance and some of those liability lines that Dan was highlighting. I'm wondering, is there any more detail you can provide here with regards to specific accident years? It sounded like GL. Also, I don't think you guys are alone in seeing some adverse on these years. I think everyone had thought that these were better priced years relative to 2019 and prior. Could you just talk about what exactly is the disconnect here and why there's some adverse coming on those years?\nDan Frey: Hey, David. It's Dan. Sure. I'll take that. Yes. By more recent accident years, we're not talking about 15 through 19. We're talking about years more recent than that. I guess the thing I'll reiterate from my comments is we're talking about some pretty small movements here. We had some adverse in those recent accident year liability lines. We also had some modest charges in the runoff book. I think what we're doing here, David, is trying to be reactive to all the information we're seeing those recent accident years in the liability lines, which tend to take longer to develop and be on the books for a while, are more leveraged to IB&R. We're just trying to get some more IB&R into those lines to recognize that uncertainty.\nAlan Schnitzer: David, its Alan. The other thing I'd add is there's not any significant new developments here. These are generally the same trends we've been talking about for a long time, a little more of the same. Again, to reiterate Dan's comment, when you look at the overall reserves we have for these lines, these are very small adjustments.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Then, maybe just switching gears to the personal auto business, Michael, I think you had mentioned that there was maybe some benefit just from mild frequency given a warmer than typical first quarter. Is there any way you could size that just to help us think about the sustainability of the improvement in the auto business?\nMichael Klein: Yes, sure, David. I think the mild frequency impact on the underlying combined ratio was a little less than a point.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nGregory Peters: Good morning, everyone. For the first question, I'll focus on the Business Insurance segment. In the comments and in the stats, I think there's 7% or higher renewal rate change for four consecutive quarters. Retention seems to be holding up, maybe slipping a little bit. Maybe you could step back and give us some context about, or texture I think is the word you used, about the competitive environment. Curious, given all the rate change that's coming through, why we haven't seen more aggressive actions on behalf of some of the competitors yet, or maybe there's still reconciling previous year's results as well. I don't know. Just some color there would be helpful.\nAlan Schnitzer: Good morning, Greg. It's Alan. I'll start and then turn it over to Greg. Hard for us to comment for competitors, but we do think that in the pricing we've been able to achieve with these retentions, you do see a reflection of the competitive environment. I'd say that everybody is, well, what we would speculate is that everybody's reacting to the same things that we're reacting to. There's returns in a much better place after years of pricing and improvements in terms and conditions, but there are some headwinds and some uncertainty out there. All the things we've talked about, there's social inflation, economic inflation, a tight labor market. Weather, geopolitics, I think, puts a certain lens over the way we all see the world. I suspect what you have is a marketplace that's reacting to an overall level of risk and uncertainty.\nGregory Peters: I guess I'll pivot then. If you look at the proxy statement, I know ROE targets are a very important metric for you all. I think the target was 12.8% for 2023 up from 11.6% from 2022. Can you talk about how you're looking at the ROE targets for the company for 2024, please?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes, I don't think we're going to share that target. It gets competitively sensitive and close to pricing. But I will say we think about that in terms of the overall outlook for our business. We think about the rate at which the interest rate environment is earning into the fixed income portfolio, which turns over on a lag basis. And we think about really what we want to achieve as a margin over both the 10-year treasury and our cost of equity. So those are the things we think about as we put the plan together. Dan, anything else I'm missing there?\nDan Frey: No, you got it all.\nGregory Peters: Got it. Thanks.\nDan Frey: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. My first question is on personal auto. I think you guys said that Q1 is seasonally the lowest combined ratio quarter, but you still have a good amount of rate earning in the book. So shouldn't that obscure some of the seasonality, or would you expect Q1 to be better from a combined ratio perspective on the underlying side relative to the other three quarters of the year, even knowing you have rate to earn in?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Elyse. It's Michael. So just taking a step back and talking about auto, the seasonality comment is a long-term average comment. Typically, Q1 is roughly three points lower than the overall combined ratio for the year. But that's, again, a long-term average and largely an all-else equal environment. So that three points doesn't adjust for earned effective pricing potentially having impact in the back half of the year. And so you have to make an adjustment for that, no question. But, again, I would just take a step back and maybe put a little more color around my response to David as well. So the mild winter weather benefit we would view as sort of a one-off in the quarter that we wouldn't expect to continue, we don't see any reason to assume adjusted for that. That seasonality is any different today than it was historically. And at the end of the day, to the premise of your question, the earned effective pricing is far and away the biggest driver of the improvement in the quarter, and there's more of that to come going forward.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question, I wanted to go back to the liability reserve increase in the quarter. Could you give us a sense, if there were some additions, I know the numbers are modest, like you guys said, on accident year 2023. And then, given the additions you see here, are you adjusting your longer trend, long-term loss trend assumption for the liability lines following this?\nDan Frey: So, Elyse, it's Dan. I'll start with the PYD piece and avoid the temptation of splitting what is a small number to begin with into its individual accident years. So we're not going to do that. I do think if you look at the results in Business Insurance, we talked about the fact that you saw some improvement in the underlying combined ratio, including in the underlying loss ratio. You have the benefit of pricing and a couple of other things like mix, which we talked about last quarter. The same time, like in any quarter, you've got some puts and takes, and one of those puts and takes in this quarter is booking a little bit more IB&R in the current accident year to reflect some of the uncertainty that we're seeing. Not big numbers, but we are reacting to it.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. First one for Michael. Michael, I'm just curious, one of your competitors in the personal auto space is showing some pretty strong growth in policy and so forth, really kind of capitalizing the market. I'm just curious, are you in a position at this point to kind of go after and get some growth given how your results have improved so much?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Certainly, again, underneath the results in the quarter, if you look at it on a state-by-state basis, the states where we have achieved written adequacy, we've achieved written adequacy, we did achieve new business premium growth. And consistent with our comments last quarter, what I would say to you is we're executing a very granular state-by-state, geography-by-geography strategy as we look to temper some of the non-rate actions that we had in place in auto. And if you take a step back, if you look at it over the last couple of years, we have a small increase in policies in force in auto over the last couple years or so. We got a small decrease in property, all the while premiums are up 30-plus percent. So we feel pretty good about the starting point. And directly to your question, our focus in auto is on profitably growing auto on a go-forward basis. Our focus on home remains on improving profitability, and so that's why we talk about sort of balancing profitability and growth across the whole portfolio.\nBrian Meredith: Makes sense. Thanks. And then a follow-up on the Business Insurance. Alan and Greg, I wonder if you could kind of dissect kind of the competitive landscape, kind of large, middle, small. Are any of them kind of incrementally more competitive? It feels like small, middle seems to be a little more stable right now than maybe the large from what we're hearing in the marketplace.\nAlan Schnitzer: Brian, let me just comment and I\u2019ll turn it over to Greg. I think all of these markets are always competitive all the time, and that's sort of the way we think about it. So I'm not sure. I mean, as Greg shared in his prepared remarks, to the extent that you're thinking about, renewal price change as a proxy for competition, and I don't think it is, by the way. That did come down a couple of points, but, again, still among our highest rate achieved in any line, and, double digits and a reflection of terrific returns in the line. So I don't think there's been any sea change in or any significant shift, among those businesses. I'd say competitive business that we have. I don't know, Greg.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes, maybe I'll touch on new business since Alan just hit on rate. And you can see in the new business we had a real strong quarter in small commercial up 22%, so that we are seeing a little more dislocation in that market than we are in middle market. But the combination of our new segmented product, BOP 2.0, and our new commercial automobile product, we feel terrific about, our position there and where we're writing that new business and what returns we're going to achieve there. Middle market still had, the delta wasn't as big on new business, but we had a record result on the first quarter of the prior year, so really strong new business levels. So not as much dislocation, Brian, in the middle market, but really feeling good about the combination of where the returns are and our field team staying really active on the new business front.\nBrian Meredith: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple, I guess, on exposure acting as rate. So, yes, exposure acting as rates clearly been a tailwind in particular for margins. It's been flagged, for the past couple years, especially in the workers' comp line. But this is the first quarter in a long time I think, I've seen that workers' comp NPW shrink year-over-year. So curious sort of, what dynamic might be going on there?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes. Good morning, Ryan. How you doing? This is Greg. Yes, exposure continues to be strong, down somewhat as you look at the businesses. Not a surprise to us as the Fed has been very active in curtailing inflation. So definitely we're seeing some of that in workers' comp. But the primary driver of the down in comp is, we do still have rate reductions, as I shared in my prepared comments, relative to the other products. And as we're an account solution, we're going to remain very active and disciplined with our underwriting. And as we invoke both of those dynamics in the business, that's what drove the overall net written premium change in the comp line.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And I guess if I look at the overall, the exposure is still positive across the book. So clearly something else is picking that up. On the property side, are you guys still getting positive exposure adjustments from like insured value adjustments? Or is that really just kind of a 2023 catch up thing that's already happened?\nGregory Toczydlowski: Yes, as you can imagine, it's somewhat linear with inflation, Ryan. So 2023, we had some record results of trying to keep up with the replacement costs and building materials. So it's down somewhat from 2023, but still up overall.\nAlan Schnitzer: Hey, Ryan, as a macro comment, if you look at that exposure, it's easy to get very focused on recent periods. But if you look at that number over time, it's a pretty healthy number that I think is consistent with what is today a pretty healthy economy.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Meyers Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyers Shields: Great, thanks. If I can stick with property for a second, last year when we tracked renewal pricing changes, it sort of peaked in the second and third quarter. And I'm wondering whether there's a seasonal element to that or we should just sort of follow that curve to anticipate smaller rate increases because of the reduced indicated need over the course of 2024?\nAlan Schnitzer: Meyer, yes, there really isn't a seasonal element of pricing overall. Our field underwriters are going to look at the exposure at hand and the renewal book will change over time as we write incremental new business. And so overall, it's dependent on the exposures that come up for that particular quarter. That's more of the dynamic than any seasonality.\nDan Frey: Yes, Meyer, it's Dan. I'll just add in case your question is not just seasonality of pure price change, but within the property line, there's some seasonality of its mix on a written premium basis. And to your point, and you can see it in the financial supplement, the second and third quarters tend to be relatively higher levels of commercial property compared to what comes up in Q1 and Q4.\nMeyers Shields: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. If I can switch gears, I wanted to talk a little bit about workers' compensation reserve releases because based on the statutory numbers, there were like 900 million of releases in 2023. And I think you said less than 100 this quarter. So that's slowing down. I was hoping you could maybe break that down either by accident year or the difference between actual claim emergence versus indications.\nDan Frey: Yes, Meyer, it's Dan. So again, I'm going to resist the temptation to do it by accident year. It's multiple accident years in comp as it normally is. We're really just going through the same robust and disciplined review process every quarter in comp and in every line. We'll go through the latest data. We'll look at how it might have varied from what our actuarial models would have expected. And we'll do our best to determine the reasons why the actual varied from expected and book the necessary adjustments accordingly. And the number is just sort of going to be what it's going to be. And if you think about this quarter versus last quarter or this quarter versus next quarter in any particular line, prior reserve development might be more, might be less. We'll wait and see what the data tells us. But it's more of the same in terms of thematically what's coming through. We have continued to make assumptions around what long-term severity is going to be. We have assumptions around what frequency is going to be. And that of those things has been some more good news in the first part of this year.\nAlan Schnitzer: Meyer, I'll also add that as we, one part of our consideration process as we go through this is to make sure that we're appropriately reflecting our thoughts about uncertainty. So that's, just something to keep in mind.\nMeyers Shields: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of BMO. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Great. Good morning. On the, maybe question on the Business Insurance segment, when we look at the underlying combined ratio, it's, it's shown a nice trend of, I guess improvement versus prior years. And that's kind of despite you all kind of topping off IB&R and kind of adding to reserves on recent vintages. And so just curious about that dynamic, how is it that your view of kind of the underlying has stayed excellent kind of, and not kind of drifted a bit higher as you've taken some just small actions? Is it just pricing powers been, you think just much higher than loss cost trend or any color you have would be helpful?\nAlan Schnitzer: Let me, let me start and I'll turn it over to you, Dan. So we understand that sometimes the investment community can get very focused on a couple of metrics as you think about what drives it, but, but that's really not the way it comes together. It comes together through all the things that, that impact margins. And so, if you look at the excellent result this quarter earn pricing was a significant benefit favorable mix was a little bit of a benefit and there was some small items going the other way that that partially upset some of that benefit. As Dan mentioned, we booked a little bit more IB&R as a reflection of uncertainty, a little bit of non-CAT weather a little bit of discrete large loss activity none of those things significant and as you can tell from the fact that it was an excellent and improving number but every quarter there's there are just a bunch of factors that add up and puts and takes.\nDan Frey: Yes, that's right. And I think the only thing I\u2019d add to that and I'd sort of confirm your premise in the question Mike is it's really a very strong pricing environment if you go back and look at the i-commentary over the last year or two it's one of the reasons we've been so pleased to see retention remain as a strong as it has because we love the profile of the book and we're trying to, so we're happy to be retaining it, happy to get pricing on top of it and that's improving margins and then in any quarter it's going to be impacted by some of the things that Alan just mentioned.\nMike Zaremski: Okay that's helpful. My last follow-up is on maybe more on homeowners' personal lines. Given the, what seems like continued trend of higher task losses, any changes you're seeing in the industry or the travelers trying to implement on terms and conditions such as roof replacement, are there any trends there we should be thinking about? Thanks.\nMichael Klein: Sure, Mike. It's Michael. Absolutely. I think if you, if you dig underneath our comments around non-rate actions, there's a variety of things that we're executing on, and many of which we're seeing across the industry. And examples include, first of all, eligibility, right, based on an evaluation of the exposure also eligibility on age of roof, underwriting restrictions around things like roof condition and tree overhang. Our primary approach on sort of risk sharing, if you will, is really to focus on AOP and wind-hail tornado deductibles. We've implemented higher wind-hail tornado deductibles in virtually every severe convective storm exposed state across the country. I think the last count were up to, I think, 21 states where we've increased deductibles to help to deal with the exposure. And then, managing distribution and managing appetite to manage aggregation of exposure, within a local or a state-by-state geography. So really, those are some examples of the variety of actions we're taking from a non-rate perspective, which is really what we're referring to when we talk about managing growth and improving profitability and property.\nMike Zaremski: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Totally different turn here. Florida homeowners market, obviously, market has not been a big player. And I'm wondering if any of the reforms that have been taking place in the past couple of years have given you pause to maybe revisit that?\nMichael Klein: Sure. Great question and certainly something that we spend time evaluating. What I would say is certainly reforms in Florida, some of the depopulation of citizens in Florida are certainly things that make Florida look better than it has in the past. But it is still a highly CAT exposed geography. It is still a place where we think the risk-reward is not in balance. And one of the things, frankly, in Florida that remains a significant concern is the potential assigned risk obligation in the event of a significant catastrophe. And so, and I think Alan's referred to this in the past. We see signs of improvement in the state, but it's going to take more than what we've seen. And one of the things that it causes you to think about is whether or not you can compete in Florida on an admitted basis versus an excess and surplus lines basis. So those are all some of the considerations around Florida. The upshot for us is while we do see those signs of improvement, we haven't seen enough change to cause us to change our perspective on wanting to, reopen for new business and property in Florida.\nAlan Schnitzer: Yes, the TOR [ph] reforms that they enacted we think were an excellent start. We certainly love other states to follow suit because we think regulatory reform is important as it relates to affordability, not just insurance, but of home ownership and autos. But there are some other structural things in the state that are, just make it difficult at the moment. We'll continue to reevaluate it.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, great. Thank you guys. Thanks for the color. Second question, personal auto. Are you seeing any sign there of kind of just higher attorney [ph] involvement in personal auto that give you [Indiscernible] concern?\nAlan Schnitzer: Sure, Michael. I would say that, in Q1, it's, first of all, bodily injury is where most attorney involvement occurs. And in Q1, it's the longest tail element of the exposure we see in personal insurance. So concluding anything based on what we saw in the quarter from a bodily injury standpoint is a challenge. But the same, sort of social inflation, litigation, abuse challenges that Greg has talked about a lot in Business Insurance, we're not immune from in personal insurance. We have seen over a longer period of time increased attorney involvement impact bodily injury. But all that said, if we look at bodily injury results in the quarter, bodily injury loss trends were pretty consistent with what we expected.\nMichael Phillips: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Ward: Thanks. Good morning. I was just curious, the growth in commercial auto accelerated pretty meaningfully. Was that mostly price or how should we think about the pricing environment in that line?\nMichael Klein: Good morning, Michael. Yes, it was. I think most of the growth that happened from a net written premium change was due to RPC. One thing I would point out, and I referenced a little bit earlier, we do have our new automobile product that we've rolled out across all Business Insurance in our express select underwriting route model and also in our transactional middle market business, our TCAP [ph] product. So we feel, terrific about that latest segmentation and that should ultimately improve the return profiles on that business overall. But the biggest change was RPC.\nMichael Ward: Great. Thank you. And maybe just back to GL, you noted the charges were relatively modest. I guess just compared to last year's charges, are they similar, less, or any other color around that? Thanks.\nDan Frey: Hey, Michael. It's Dan. I guess I'll say if you just look at the comment being that, comp was approaching 100 million, the segment was zero, some of it was runoff, you could get to an implication of sort of a box around how much the GL must have been. And for whatever it's worth, and I'm not sure how much it's worth, that would tell you that the first quarter number was probably less than some of the magnitude that we saw in last year. But again, we'll do a full evaluation again next quarter and the number will be more or less favorable or unfavorable depending on what the data tells us.\nMichael Ward: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks. So we saw some data potentially indicating a slowdown in premium growth in the E&S market. And I know Travelers has about 2.5 billion in E&S and you guys have indicated that margins there are quite attractive. Just curious if you saw any changes in competitive dynamics in E&S or pricing.\nGregory Toczydlowski: Hi, Robert. This is Greg. Yes, as we've shared with you, underneath that 2.5 billion, we have quite a bit of diverse businesses that drive that. And we didn't really see any material slowdown in the segments that we compete in.\nRobert Cox: Okay, got it. And maybe secondly, I'm curious as I think you've started to go through some of the re-underwriting of the Corvus book, if you've learned anything material and if there's any major takeaways.\nJeffrey Klenk: Yes, thanks, Robert. It's Jeff. We're 3.5 months now into our integration. We're feeling really good about bringing and leveraging the capabilities of both organizations. I would tell you that we feel really good about the quality and the profitability of the Corvus book of business. It's consistent and we're taking some of those capabilities. We've already completed the scans using their proprietary technology to the existing Traveler's book of business. Really comfortable with what we're seeing. Thanks for the question.\nRobert Cox: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. It will be from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Paul Newsome, your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: Hi, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just a couple of quick personalized questions. Is it fair to say that the renewal premium change for both auto and home, given what you've already filed and the fact that you're getting closer to or you've gotten most states to adequacy, that we should see that decelerate fairly meaningfully in the next couple of quarters? Just any thoughts about that so that we aren't surprised?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Paul. It's Michael. I would separate auto and home. For auto, you'll see RPC moderate as we go throughout the year. I wouldn't suggest it's going to be a sharp decline. One of the things that I think is important to think about as you think about RPC over time for us is we write mostly 12-month policies in auto. While someone who writes a lot of six-month policies is going to see RPC accelerate quickly on the front end, they're going to actually see it decelerate more quickly on the back end. Ours is going to be a more gradual increase and then a more gradual decrease because we file a rate in May of 2023. We're still renewing policies at that same higher rate in April of 2024. So just a little bit of context for why I say it's going to be more of a gradual deceleration in auto RPC. In property RPC, we don't anticipate a deceleration. We're going to continue to drive rate into the property portfolio in response to increased loss costs. I would expect RPC to remain relatively consistent through the balance of 2024 in property.\nPaul Newsome: I did notice that the renewal rate in home did come down quite a bit, at least sequentially. Is that just sort of an anomaly or is it something to note?\nMichael Klein: Sure, Paul. The RPC drop from Q4 to Q1 in property is what we were referring to last year when we talked about the fact that we've made a lot of progress on insurance to value in home. So when you think about renewal premium change in personal lines property, it's really driven by two primary things. One is rate and then the other is increasing the coverage limit on the dwelling. And in 2022 and 2023, we made dramatic increases in property coverage A limits in home that drove a decent amount of the property RPC. In my prepared remarks, that's why I mentioned that when you look at that 13.4%, it actually reflects improvement in rate from last quarter to this quarter. And the drop is really because we've essentially caught up on insurance to value in property. So that's why I say you're not going to see a further incremental change in RPC due to that coverage A limit dynamic because that's just going to stay the same. And now what you're looking at is mostly our outlook for rate in property for 2024, which again is to keep it pretty consistent.\nPaul Newsome: Thank you. That helps always much appreciated.\nOperator: Thank you. I will turn the call to Ms. Goldstein for closing remarks.\nAbbe Goldstein: Thank you all very much again for joining us this morning. And as usual, if there's any follow up, please feel free to reach out directly to Investor Relations. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."}]}
