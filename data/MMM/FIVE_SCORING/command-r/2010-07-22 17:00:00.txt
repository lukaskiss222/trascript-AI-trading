Ceradyne's stock will likely experience a negative impact in the short term following the earnings call. The delayed military contracts and reduced 2008 body armour forecasts painted a uncertain picture for investors, overshadowing the positive expansions and growth prospects highlighted by management. The guidance for 2008 failed to assuage concerns, indicating a potential short-term decline in share price.
