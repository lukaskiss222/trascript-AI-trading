3M's Q1 2010 earnings call indicates exceptionally strong performance, significantly exceeding market expectations and exceeding 2008 levels despite a still-recovering economy.  Management attributes this to a significant acceleration in organic sales volume growth, driven by market share gains in various segments (particularly electronics and industrial), inventory restocking, and currency translation.  The positive tone with regards to the company's outlook and its cautious yet optimistic guidance implies a positive short-term impact on the stock price.
