3M's Q3 earnings were largely in line with expectations, with organic growth exceeding initial projections, but the guidance for Q4 and full year 2022 was lowered due to softer consumer demand and a stronger US dollar.

The lowered outlook suggests a slightly negative impact on the stock in the coming weeks, likely driven by investors reacting to the altered guidance.
