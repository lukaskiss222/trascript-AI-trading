3M's Q3 earnings call highlighted continued strong growth, particularly in emerging markets and industrial segments.  However, a slowdown in healthcare sales due to reduced H1N1 demand and potential inventory adjustments in the Display and Graphics business, which could negatively affect Q4 earnings, represent near-term challenges. Management is confident in the long-term strategy and appears to be anticipating a slow recovery in the U.S. and Europe, but also seeing opportunities for growth in emerging markets.  The stock might experience downward pressure in the short term due to these projected impacts, however, future opportunities in new markets give some cause for bullish outlook.
