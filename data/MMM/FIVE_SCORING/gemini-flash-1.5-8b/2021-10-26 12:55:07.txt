3M's Q3 earnings call reveals strong performance despite significant supply chain challenges.  Management highlighted broad-based organic growth and resilient margins, exceeding expectations in some areas.  Guidance updates reflect the ongoing uncertainty, with a higher-end projection for organic growth and EPS, though a wider than normal Q4 range acknowledges ongoing supply chain effects. The call's tone suggests proactive management of cost pressures and continued focus on long-term growth.
