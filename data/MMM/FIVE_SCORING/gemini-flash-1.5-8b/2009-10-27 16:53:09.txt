Ceradyne's Q3 2009 earnings reveal a challenging quarter, marked by significant declines in defense-related sales, particularly in body armor and vehicle armor.  However, management highlights stabilization of order rates and robust opportunities in non-defense sectors like solar energy, aluminum smelting, and oil and gas drilling.  The company's focus on cost reduction and diversification into new markets suggests a potential for moderate growth in the short term, but the substantial restructuring charges and lowered guidance indicate a cautious outlook for the next 1â€“2 weeks.
