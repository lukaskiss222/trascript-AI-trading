3M's Q1 earnings call revealed significant restructuring efforts.  Management announced a substantial cost-cutting plan targeting $700-900 million in savings, largely via organizational streamlining and operational improvements.  While acknowledging a challenging economic environment, the company delivered slightly better than expected results and affirmed full-year guidance.  The stock price is likely to react positively to these cost-cutting measures and the company's focus on high-growth segments, but near-term market headwinds will likely dampen enthusiasm.
