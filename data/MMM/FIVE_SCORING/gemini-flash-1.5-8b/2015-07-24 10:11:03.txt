3M's Q2 2015 earnings call highlighted a somewhat mixed picture. While the company saw continued organic growth and margin expansion across several business segments (particularly Safety & Graphics and Healthcare), the electronics and energy segment experienced soft demand.  Management's guidance update pointed to a more conservative organic growth outlook for the full year (2.5-4% vs. 3-6%), and while acknowledging macroeconomic uncertainty, the focus remains on portfolio management to improve efficiency and drive profitability in the face of a potentially slower growth environment.  This likely leads to moderate short-term trading pressure, and the stock may consolidate around the recent price action until the next earnings report.
