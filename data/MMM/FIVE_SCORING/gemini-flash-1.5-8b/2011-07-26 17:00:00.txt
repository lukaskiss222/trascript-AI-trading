3M's Q2 2011 earnings show strong performance despite headwinds from the Japanese earthquake, slower LCD TV demand, and some general economic uncertainty.  Management's commentary highlights continued strength in Industrial and Transportation, Safety and Security, and Health Care.  While optical films suffered a decline, management anticipates a return to growth in the second half as market conditions improve.  This suggests positive but cautious short-term outlook, with possible stock price appreciation tied to the anticipated recovery.
