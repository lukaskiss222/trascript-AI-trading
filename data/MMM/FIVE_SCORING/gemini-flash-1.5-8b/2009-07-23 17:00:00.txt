3M's Q2 2009 earnings call highlighted a sequential improvement in sales and profits, exceeding internal expectations in several areas.  Management pointed to positive developments in consumer electronics, and the H1N1 response as key drivers.  However, the overall outlook remains cautious, with continued uncertainty in major end markets like automotive and housing. A strong focus on cost-cutting and cash generation is anticipated to sustain profitability throughout the year; share repurchase activity remains on hold.
