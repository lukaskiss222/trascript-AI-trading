3M's Q1 2009 earnings call highlighted a challenging environment, with sales significantly below expectations due to steep declines in automotive, electronics, and other end markets.  However, the company maintained strong operating margins and exceeded internal earnings plans due to significant cost-cutting measures.  The outlook for the remainder of the year is cautiously optimistic, with management forecasting a bottoming out of the economy and recovery beginning in Q3, although with a possible lag in Europe.
