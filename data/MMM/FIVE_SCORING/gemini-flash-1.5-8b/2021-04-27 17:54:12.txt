3M's Q1 2021 earnings call highlights strong performance with record sales and EPS growth.  Management, while maintaining full-year guidance, acknowledges supply chain headwinds (raw materials and logistics costs) and uncertainties related to COVID-19's impact on various end markets.  The anticipated increase in legal costs, though not precisely quantified, is a factor for caution. The short-term outlook appears positive on the growth front due to eased pandemic-related comps, but potential supply chain and legal issues could impact the stock's immediate price movement.
