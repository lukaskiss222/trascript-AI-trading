3M's Q3 2012 earnings call indicates continued solid performance, albeit against a backdrop of challenging macroeconomic conditions.  Management highlighted strong operational discipline, especially in North America, and positive organic growth across most segments.  However, the call also suggests a tempered outlook for Q4 and 2013, with a cautious approach to near-term growth expectations, particularly in the electronics sector driven by weaker-than-projected industry performance and slower sales in the fourth quarter.
