3M's Q2 2016 earnings were strong, exceeding expectations with record earnings per share, despite a slight dip in organic sales.  Management highlighted successful cost-cutting measures and capital investments, along with positive growth in key segments like Health Care and Consumer.  The cautious outlook for Electronics & Energy and slight downward revision of full-year organic growth guidance suggests a short-term headwind, but the overall positive sentiment and focus on long-term initiatives may create a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
