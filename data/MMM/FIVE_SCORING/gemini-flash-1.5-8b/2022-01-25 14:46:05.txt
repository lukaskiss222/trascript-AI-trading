3M's earnings call, while highlighting strong December performance, driven by respirator sales, acknowledges ongoing supply chain and inflation pressures.  Management is focused on cost controls, price increases, and productivity improvements, with a commitment to share buybacks.  The company's strategic update is planned for February 14th, but the call indicates a volatile first half of 2022, particularly regarding the outlook for N95 mask demand and global manufacturing conditions.
