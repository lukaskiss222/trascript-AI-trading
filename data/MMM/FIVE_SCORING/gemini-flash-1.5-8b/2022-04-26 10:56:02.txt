3M's Q1 earnings call highlighted strong sequential performance, but tempered growth expectations due to macroeconomic headwinds.  The company's guidance remains unchanged, but management is explicitly acknowledging a softening macro outlook, particularly in auto and electronics, potentially impacting 1-2 week market sentiment. Concerns surrounding litigation and ongoing remediation efforts at the Belgium facility are noted, but don't materially shift their full-year expectations.
