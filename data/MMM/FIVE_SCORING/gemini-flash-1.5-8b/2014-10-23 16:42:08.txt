3M's Q3 2014 earnings call highlights strong performance, including record sales and elevated margins.  Management emphasized robust global growth across all business segments, particularly in the US and Asia Pacific.  However, some cautiousness was expressed regarding potential slowing in European markets, although no major concerns were raised.
