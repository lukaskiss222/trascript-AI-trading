Ceradyne's Q3 2008 earnings show a decline in sales and net income, primarily due to a reduction in body armor shipments and non-recurring acquisition-related charges.  While the company won a large ID/IQ contract, a stop-work order on an initial delivery order and potential protest by a competitor creates uncertainty.  Strong cash flow, a focus on diversification into non-defense markets, and optimistic guidance for solar ceramics suggest potential for positive future growth, but short-term investor concerns about the impact of this protest and ongoing market uncertainty are likely to prevail.
