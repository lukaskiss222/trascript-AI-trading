3M's Q3 2018 earnings call highlighted strong financial performance, exceeding expectations in several key areas.  Management emphasized continued execution on business transformation, particularly the ERP rollout, which was partly responsible for some revenue shifts between quarters.  While the healthcare segment experienced challenges in drug delivery, other segments like Industrial and Electronics and Energy performed well.  The lowered guidance for full-year raw materials is a potential concern, though, pricing is expected to mitigate this. The outlook suggests a short-term period of slight headwinds, but the long-term strategy and investment in innovation remain positive.
