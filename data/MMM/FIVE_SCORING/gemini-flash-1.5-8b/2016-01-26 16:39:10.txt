3M's Q4 2015 earnings call highlighted a mixed performance, with a slight decline in organic sales (-1.1%) driven by weak industrial and electronics markets.  However, strong performance in Consumer and Health Care businesses, along with strategic acquisitions and significant cash return to shareholders, suggests resilience and a focus on long-term growth.  Management projects continued solid margin improvements and significant free cash flow generation, projecting a 7-11% EPS increase in 2016, positioning the stock for potential positive near-term movement.
