3M's Q3 2020 earnings call highlights strong sequential sales improvement and a return to positive organic growth, particularly in personal safety and home improvement.  Management expressed cautious optimism about a potential recovery, though noted ongoing uncertainty in several end markets and the possibility of a flattening of elective procedures; however, this is offset by strong respirator demand.  The company is investing for future growth, but maintaining cost discipline, which suggests that short-term stock fluctuations will likely depend on the future trajectory of the pandemic and its impact on specific end markets.
