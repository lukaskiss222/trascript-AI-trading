Ceradyne's Q2 2012 earnings call highlighted significant concerns about the solar and European markets.  Reduced revenue guidance, particularly from the body armor business, ESK, and the Solar Crucible segment, suggests a negative short-term outlook. Management's focus on cost-cutting and diversification initiatives, paired with the positive outlook for PetroCeram and other new product development, hints at a long-term strategy, yet the present market challenges and volatile situation in Europe put pressure on short-term stock performance.
