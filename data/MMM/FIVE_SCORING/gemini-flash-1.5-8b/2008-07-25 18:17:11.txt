Ceradyne's Q2 2008 earnings call, while showcasing strong performance in some areas, highlighted ongoing uncertainty and potential short-term headwinds.  The company's revised guidance, reflecting a less optimistic outlook on MRAP II contracts and focusing on the likelihood of smaller MRAPs, suggests some near-term cautiousness.  Management's emphasis on non-defense sectors like solar ceramics and expanding industrial opportunities alludes to long-term growth strategies but will not instantly impact the stock.
