3M's Q2 2018 earnings call highlighted robust performance, with strong organic growth across several segments, especially Safety and Graphics.  Management noted a sales acceleration in the U.S. due to an ERP rollout, which is expected to create headwinds in the future, but positive developments will hopefully continue with the anticipated improvements in growth over the next 1-2 quarters.  The company's outlook remains optimistic, with guidance adjustments that reflect the divestiture of the communications market business.
