Ceradyne's Q2 results showed stable revenues with a significant increase in new orders and backlog, indicating strong future demand. The slight upward revision of full-year guidance reflects management's confidence, particularly with the anticipated XSAPI/ESAPI body armor contracts expected to boost Q4 shipments. While the lack of MRAP II/BULL vehicle orders in 2008 may temper expectations, the positive outlook and ongoing diversification efforts suggest a favorable short-term impact on the stock.
