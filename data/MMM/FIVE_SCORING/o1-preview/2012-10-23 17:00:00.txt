3M delivered solid Q3 earnings with strong margins and steady organic growth but lowered its full-year earnings outlook due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges and a cautious view of Q4. Management's comments on slowing demand in key markets, such as electronics and China, and the adjusted guidance may lead to short-term negative sentiment among investors. As a result, the stock is likely to experience downward pressure in the next couple of weeks.
