Ceradyne's Q1 earnings call reflected a mixed performance. While sales remained steady, net income and gross margins declined due to reduced defense sales and lower absorption of fixed costs. The company reaffirmed its wide guidance for 2008, citing uncertainties around key defense contracts like the BULL combat vehicle and XSAPI/ESAPI. Despite growth in non-defense segments such as solar ceramics and ongoing stock repurchases indicating management's confidence, short-term concerns over defense contract delays and margin pressures may negatively impact the stock in the next 1â€“2 weeks.
