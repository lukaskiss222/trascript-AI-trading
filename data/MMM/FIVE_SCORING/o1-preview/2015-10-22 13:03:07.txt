3M reported strong margins and earnings growth despite a challenging macro environment, but it lowered its full-year organic growth guidance and announced a restructuring plan involving 1,500 job cuts. The reduced guidance and restructuring may signal near-term headwinds and could be viewed negatively by investors. Therefore, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to these developments.
