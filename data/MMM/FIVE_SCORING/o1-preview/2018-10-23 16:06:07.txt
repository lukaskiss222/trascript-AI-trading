3M lowered its full-year guidance due to slower growth expectations, increased raw material and tariff costs, and currency headwinds. Key segments like Healthcare and Consumer showed declines, with significant weakness in the drug delivery business, and management highlighted challenges in markets like China and Europe. Given the lowered guidance and multiple headwinds, the stock is likely to face significant short-term pressure.
