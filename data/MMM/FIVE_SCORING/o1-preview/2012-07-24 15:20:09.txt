Ceradyne reported a significant decline in quarterly earnings, lowered its revenue and earnings guidance for the year, and highlighted continued challenges in its key markets, including delays in military contracts and weakness in the solar and European sectors. Management's cautious outlook and the absence of immediate catalysts suggest that the stock is likely to face downward pressure in the short term.
