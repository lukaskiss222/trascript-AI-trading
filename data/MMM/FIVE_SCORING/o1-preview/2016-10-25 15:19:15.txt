3M reported stable earnings with a 5% increase in EPS and robust cash flow, but flat sales and a slight decline in organic growth. The company narrowed its full-year guidance and anticipates organic sales growth at the low end of prior expectations due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges and softness in key segments like Electronics & Energy and Health Care. These factors suggest the stock may face modest short-term pressure.
