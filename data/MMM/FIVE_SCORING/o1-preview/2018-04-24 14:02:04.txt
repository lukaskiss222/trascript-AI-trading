3M reported strong Q1 earnings with a 16% increase in EPS and record sales. However, the company lowered the high end of its full-year organic growth and EPS guidance due to softer markets in certain segments and rising raw material costs. This adjustment may lead to short-term negative investor sentiment and a potential decrease in the stock price.
