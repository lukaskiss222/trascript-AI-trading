Ceradyne's Q3 2009 earnings call revealed significant declines in sales, earnings, and gross margins, along with a lowered full-year guidance. The decreased demand in core defense products, especially body armor, presents short-term challenges, and while the company is diversifying into non-defense sectors, these efforts may not offset the immediate revenue shortfall. Given the negative financial results and cautious outlook, the stock is likely to face short-term downward pressure.
