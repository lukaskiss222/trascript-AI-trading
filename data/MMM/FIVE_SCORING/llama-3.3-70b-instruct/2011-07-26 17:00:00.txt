3M's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company achieving record sales but facing headwinds from the Japan earthquake, LCD TV market weakness, and raw material inflation. Despite these challenges, management expressed optimism about the company's prospects, citing strength in industrial and safety businesses, as well as progress on pricing and margin recovery. The company maintained its organic growth guidance and raised the lower end of its EPS guidance range. 

Given the mixed results and management's cautious yet optimistic tone, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term.
