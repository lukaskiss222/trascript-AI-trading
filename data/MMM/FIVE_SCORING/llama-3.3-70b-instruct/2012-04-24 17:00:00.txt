3M's Q1 earnings report showed positive sales, operating income, and EPS growth, with the company achieving an all-time Q1 sales record of $7.5 billion. The industrial and transportation segment performed well, with sales growing 9%, while the healthcare segment saw broad-based organic growth. However, the electronics-related businesses posted sales declines due to lower customer production levels. Management raised the lower end of their earnings guidance range by $0.10, citing confidence in their ability to deliver on their plan despite a weaker economic environment. The company also announced plans to invest $30-50 million in targeted areas such as technology development, business building, and emerging markets.
