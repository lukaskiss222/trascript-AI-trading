3M's first-quarter earnings call revealed a strong performance, with 15% top-line growth and a record $1.49 EPS. The company's diverse portfolio and geographic presence helped mitigate the impact of the Japan earthquake and raw material inflation. Management's tone was optimistic, with expectations of continued growth and improved margins. The guidance update, which includes a range of 6% to 7.5% organic sales growth, suggests a positive outlook. Considering these factors, I predict a short-term positive impact on the stock price.
