Ceradyne's Q4 and full-year earnings call revealed mixed signals, with the company achieving record annual sales but also facing a lowered 2008 guidance, delays in military contracts, and reduced body armor forecasts. The company's management expressed concerns about the delays in armor orders and uncertainties in industrial markets, particularly in Europe. Despite these challenges, the company remains committed to investing in its future, diversifying its business, and maintaining its strong liquidity position. In the short term, the stock is likely to face pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
