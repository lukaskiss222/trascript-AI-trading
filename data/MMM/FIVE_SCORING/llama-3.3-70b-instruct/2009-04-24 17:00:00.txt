3M's Q1 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with the company beating internal expectations despite a challenging economic environment. The company's sales were down 21.3% year-over-year, with organic volume declines of 19.5% due to weak end markets and inventory corrections. However, 3M's operating margin remained strong at 17.1%, driven by effective cost control measures. The company's guidance for 2009 was revised downward, with organic sales volumes expected to decline between 11% and 15%, and EPS expected to come in between $3.90 and $4.30. While the near-term outlook is cautious, 3M's management expressed confidence in the company's ability to navigate the economic downturn and emerge stronger in the long term.
