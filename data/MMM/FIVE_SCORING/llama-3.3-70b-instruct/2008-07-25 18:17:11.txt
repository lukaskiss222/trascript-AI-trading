Ceradyne's Q2 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results, with sales slightly down from the previous year, but net income decreasing to $33.2 million. The company's guidance for 2008 was revised, with sales projected to be between $740 million and $750 million, and earnings per share expected to range from $4.70 to $4.80. The main drivers of the revised guidance were the expected award of the XSAPI contract and the company's better-than-expected performance in the first half of the year. However, the delay in the MRAP II contract and the reduced body armor forecast are potential headwinds. Overall, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
