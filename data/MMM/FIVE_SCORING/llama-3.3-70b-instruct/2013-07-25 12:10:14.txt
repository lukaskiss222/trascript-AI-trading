3M's Q2 earnings report showed mixed results, with the company achieving record quarterly sales but facing headwinds from a strong US dollar and delays in military contracts. The lowered 2008 guidance and reduced body armor forecasts also pose short-term challenges. However, management's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and manufacturing suggest long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
