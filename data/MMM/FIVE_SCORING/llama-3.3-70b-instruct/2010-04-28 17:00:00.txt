3M's impressive Q1 results, with 25% sales growth and adjusted earnings of $1.40 per share, are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price in the short term. The company's ability to deliver strong organic growth, driven by its diversified portfolio and successful execution of its strategic plan, is a key factor contributing to this outlook. Additionally, management's raised guidance for 2010, with expected organic sales growth of 10-12% and adjusted earnings of $5.40-5.60 per share, provides further support for a positive stock price reaction. While some investors may be cautious due to the easy comparisons and potential for inventory restocking, the overall tone of the earnings call suggests that 3M is well-positioned for continued growth and margin expansion.
