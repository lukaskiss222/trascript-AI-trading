### Short-Term Impact Analysis

**Company Performance vs. Expectations:**
- The company reported strong earnings of $2.50 per share, a 16% increase year-over-year, and total sales of $8.3 billion, an all-time high.
- Organic growth was 3% across all business groups, with notable growth in Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy, and Consumer.

**Management’s Tone:**
- The management team expressed confidence in their ability to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year.
- They highlighted the strong performance in developing markets, particularly China, and planned to continue investing in these regions.

**Guidance Updates:**
- The company adjusted its 2018 guidance for organic growth to a range of 3% to 4%, down from 3% to 5%, and for EPS to a range of $10.20 to $10.55, down from $10.20 to $10.70.
- The adjustment was mainly due to market softness in specific segments, such as automotive aftermarket and oral care.

**External/Macro Influences:**
- The potential impact of the trade war and protectionism on the company’s operations in China was discussed, but management expressed confidence in their position due to the broad-based growth of domestic-facing businesses.
- The company also mentioned the impact of the weaker U.S. dollar on gross margins, with hedging losses offsetting some of the benefits.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the downward adjustment in the full-year organic growth and EPS guidance. The company’s strong Q1 performance was not enough to offset the concerns around market softness and the potential impact of external factors like trade tensions. However, the management's confidence in their long-term strategy and the strong performance in key markets like China provide some support for the stock.
