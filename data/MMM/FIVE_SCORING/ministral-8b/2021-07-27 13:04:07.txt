Additionally, the company's focus on strategic growth opportunities, such as investing in emerging markets and diversifying its product portfolio, was emphasized. However, the company's guidance for the full year was adjusted downward due to expected headwinds in certain markets, such as the semiconductor shortage and the decline in demand for disposable respirators.
