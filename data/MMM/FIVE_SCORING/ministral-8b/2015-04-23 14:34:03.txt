### Analysis
The earnings call for 3M Company revealed a mixed performance with organic growth at 3.3% in the first quarter of 2015, despite a challenging economic backdrop. The company achieved record annual sales, and margins improved significantly. Key highlights included the acquisition of Polypore's Separations Media business, which will enhance the company's core filtration platform, and the acquisition of Ivera Medical, which will bolster the Health Care business. The company also returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Management expressed optimism about future growth, particularly in China and Germany, and outlined strategic expansions in these markets. However, the company faced challenges due to a strong U.S. dollar, which negatively impacted revenues and profits. The outlook for the second quarter and the full year was more conservative than previously expected, with a lower range for sales and EPS.

### Conclusion
The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative, given the lower-than-expected organic growth, the challenging economic backdrop, and the impact of a strong U.S. dollar on revenues and profits. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
