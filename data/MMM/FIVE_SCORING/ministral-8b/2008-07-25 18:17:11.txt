Based on the earnings call transcript, Ceradyne's stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the following factors:

1. **Lowered 2008 Guidance**: The company revised its 2008 guidance downwards, which could lead to a sell-off in the short term.
2. **Delays in Military Contracts**: The delays in XSAPI/ESAPI military contracts and the reduced body armor forecast could negatively impact the stock.
3. **Uncertainty in Non-Defense Markets**: While Ceradyne is expanding into non-defense markets, there is uncertainty regarding the growth and profitability of these markets.
4. **Potential Acquisitions**: The company is considering potential acquisitions, which could add to the uncertainty in the short term.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative.

**Rating: -1**
