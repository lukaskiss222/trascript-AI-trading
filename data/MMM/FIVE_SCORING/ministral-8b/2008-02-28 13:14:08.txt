### Analysis

The earnings call for Ceradyne's Q4 and full-year 2007 results revealed mixed signals. While the company achieved record annual sales, the lowered 2008 guidance, delays in military contracts, and reduced body armor forecasts signal short-term headwinds. However, management's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and manufacturing suggest long-term potential. The stock market's reaction to the call is likely to be tempered by the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Conclusion

The short-term implications for Ceradyne's stock price are likely to be negative due to the lowered guidance and delays in military contracts. However, the company's strategic initiatives and cost-saving measures suggest long-term growth potential, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
