### Analysis:

The earnings call for 3M Company in the third quarter of 2018 revealed mixed results. The company reported a 1% organic growth in sales and a 5% increase in EPS, driven by strong performances in several business groups, particularly Electronics and Energy, and Industrial. However, the Healthcare business faced significant challenges, with a 25% decline in drug delivery, and the Consumer business experienced a 2% organic decline due to channel adjustments and ERP rollout. The company also faced headwinds from raw material price increases and foreign currency impacts.

### Short-Term Implications:

1. **Positive Factors:**
   - Strong margins and cash flow.
   - Improved operational efficiency due to ERP rollout.
   - Positive outlook for growth in certain business groups, such as Electronics and Energy.

2. **Negative Factors:**
   - Challenges in the Healthcare and Consumer businesses.
   - Raw material price increases and foreign currency impacts.
   - Potential slowdown in growth due to macroeconomic factors.

### Conclusion:

Given the mixed performance and the challenges faced in certain business groups, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral. The company's focus on operational efficiency and strategic growth initiatives may help mitigate some of the negative impacts, but the ongoing challenges in specific business areas and macroeconomic factors may cause some volatility in the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks.
