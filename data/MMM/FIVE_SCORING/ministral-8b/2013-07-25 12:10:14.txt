### Short-Term Impact on 3M Stock Price

**Reasoning:**
The earnings call for 3M Company provided a mixed bag of news. On the positive side, the company reported record sales and earnings, and management expressed optimism about future growth in non-defense markets and strategic expansions in China and Germany. However, there were also concerns about delays in military contracts and a reduced 2008 body armor forecast. Additionally, the company's guidance for 2008 was lowered, and there were discussions about cost-saving measures and potential acquisitions.

**Conclusion:**
Given the mixed signals and the fact that the stock market has been challenging, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative. Investors may be cautious about the company's guidance and the challenges in the defense market. Therefore, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure.
