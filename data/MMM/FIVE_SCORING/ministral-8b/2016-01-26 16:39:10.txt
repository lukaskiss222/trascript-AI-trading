### Analysis

The earnings call for 3M Company revealed a mixed performance, with a challenging external environment and various headwinds impacting the company's growth. The company reported a 1.1% decline in organic local currency sales, driven by weak end market demand in its industrial-related businesses. However, the company's consumer-driven businesses, including Health Care and Consumer, posted strong organic growth, offsetting the decline in other segments. The company also highlighted its strategic growth initiatives and cost-saving measures, aiming for a $1 billion+ revenue target by 2010. Despite these efforts, the stock market's volatile conditions and uncertainties around key defense contracts pose significant challenges for the company.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the reduced guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. The company's focus on strategic growth and cost-saving measures suggests a long-term potential, but the immediate outlook is challenging. The stock is expected to face pressure in the coming weeks due to tempered guidance and external market conditions.
