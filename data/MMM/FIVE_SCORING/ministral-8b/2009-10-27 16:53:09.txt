The earnings call for Ceradyne revealed a mixed picture. While the company reported a decrease in sales and net income compared to the previous year, management highlighted the stabilization of order rates and progress in non-defense markets such as solar ceramics and oil & gas drilling. The guidance for 2010 projects sales between $380 million and $430 million, with earnings per share ranging from $0.60 to $1.05. The company is also planning to expand its operations in China and Germany. However, the call also highlighted concerns about the defense market, including delays in military contracts and reduced body armor forecasts. Overall, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.
