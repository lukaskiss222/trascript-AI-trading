### Analysis

Based on the transcript, 3M's Q2 2009 earnings call revealed a mixed bag of results. The company reported a 13.5% decline in organic sales volumes, which was better than the anticipated 15% to 20% decline. However, the company's overall performance was still below expectations, with sales declining 15% and earnings down 14.9%. The company attributed the improvement in sales to restocking by distributors, increased demand for consumer electronics, and efficiency improvements. The company also reported a strong cash position, with free cash flow up 38% year-over-year.

The company's outlook for the rest of the year was cautious, with expectations for organic sales volumes to come in between -10% and -13% and EPS to come in somewhere in the band $4.10 to $4.30. The company also mentioned that it was considering selectively adding to growth investments in the second half of the year, but did not provide specific details on what those investments would be.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral. While the company reported a better-than-expected performance in the second quarter, the overall performance was still below expectations. Additionally, the company's cautious outlook for the rest of the year may temper any positive sentiment from the quarterly results. Therefore, the stock price is likely to remain stable in the short term.
