**Analysis:**

The earnings call for Ceradyne provided a mixed picture. The company reported $188.5 million in sales for Q1 2008, a slight increase over the prior year, but net income decreased by 13.6% to $32.9 million. The company also provided guidance for 2008, projecting sales between $715 million and $836 million and EPS between $4.55 and $5.05. The company highlighted the continued strength of its high purity ceramics crucibles business and the expansion of its manufacturing facility in China.
