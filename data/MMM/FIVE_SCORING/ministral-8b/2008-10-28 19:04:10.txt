### Analysis

The earnings call for Ceradyne in Q3 2008 and the full-year results revealed a mixed picture. While the company reported a record annual sales figure, the financial performance was impacted by non-recurring charges and a reduced 2008 forecast. The management highlighted significant delays in military contracts and a reduced 2008 body armor forecast, which are likely to impact the stock in the short term. However, the company's focus on non-defense markets and strategic expansions in China and Germany suggests long-term growth potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

### Conclusion

The short-term impact on the stock price is expected to be negative due to the reduced guidance and delays in military contracts. However, the long-term growth prospects in non-defense markets and strategic expansions should provide support to the stock. The rating is:
