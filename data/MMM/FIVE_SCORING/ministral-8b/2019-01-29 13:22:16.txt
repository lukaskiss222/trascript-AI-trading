### Analysis

The earnings call for 3M Company revealed a strong performance in 2018, with organic growth, robust margins, and healthy cash flow. However, the outlook for 2019 was tempered by slowing growth in key markets such as China, automotive, and electronics. The company expects a range of 1% to 4% organic growth for 2019, with EPS guidance of $10.45 to $10.90, including a negative impact from the MModal acquisition. The call highlighted ongoing challenges in the safety and graphics business due to the integration of Scott Safety and the decline in roofing granules, as well as uncertainties in the automotive and electronics markets. The company is also facing potential headwinds from raw material and tariff costs, but management remains optimistic about their ability to offset these costs through selling price increases. Overall, the call suggested a cautious outlook for 2019, with potential risks in key markets and ongoing challenges in specific business segments.

### Conclusion

Based on the earnings call, the short-term (1â€“2 weeks) impact on 3M's stock is likely to be neutral to slightly negative.
