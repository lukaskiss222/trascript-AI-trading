**Analysis:**

The 3M Company's Q3 and full-year results show a mixed performance. The company achieved record annual sales but faced headwinds from reduced body armor forecasts and delays in military contracts. Management's focus on non-defense market growth, cost-cutting measures, and strategic expansions in solar ceramics and manufacturing suggests long-term potential. The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts.

**Conclusion:**

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative, given the tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. However, the company's focus on non-defense market growth and strategic expansions suggests long-term potential.

**Rating: -1**
