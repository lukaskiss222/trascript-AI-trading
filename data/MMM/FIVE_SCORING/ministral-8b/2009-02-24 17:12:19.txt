Based on the earnings transcript, Ceradyne reported a challenging fourth quarter and full-year 2008, with sales down and net income significantly reduced. Key points include:

1. **Financial Performance**: Sales were $138.9 million in Q4 2008 and $680.2 million for the full year, down from $191.4 million and $756.8 million, respectively, in the prior year. Net income also declined significantly.
2. **Guidance**: The company revised its 2009 guidance due to delays in military contracts and reduced body armor forecasts, projecting sales of $465 million to $500 million and earnings of $1.60 to $2 per diluted share.
3. **Expansions**: Ceradyne is expanding its operations in China and Germany, focusing on solar ceramics and non-defense markets.
4. **Cost-Saving Measures**: The company is implementing cost-saving measures and potential acquisitions to target $1B+ revenue by 2010.

The stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to tempered guidance and uncertainties around key defense contracts. However, the focus on non-defense market growth and strategic expansions in solar ceramics suggests long-term potential.
