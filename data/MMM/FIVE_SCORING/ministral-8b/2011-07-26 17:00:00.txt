### Analysis:

The 3M Company's Q2 2011 earnings call revealed a strong performance despite economic headwinds. Sales rose 14% to $7.7 billion, with operating income of $1.7 billion and margins of nearly 22%. The company reported earnings per share of $1.60, an all-time record for the second quarter. The management highlighted the challenges posed by the Japan earthquake and the slowdown in consumer electronics, but also noted the resilience of the company's core businesses like Industrial and Transportation, Health Care, and Safety, Security, and Protection Services. The company maintained its full-year guidance of $30 billion in sales and $6.10 to $6.25 in earnings per share, with a slight increase in the high end of the EPS range.

### Conclusion:

The short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive due to the strong earnings performance and the company's ability to navigate through economic challenges. The management's optimism about the recovery of Japan and the potential for growth in non-defense markets provides a positive outlook. However, the stock may face short-term pressure due to the reduced 2008 body armor forecast and delays in military contracts. Overall, the stock is likely to experience a positive impact in the coming weeks.
