3M reported strong second-quarter results with a significant increase in non-GAAP EPS of nearly 40% and raised its full-year earnings guidance. Management's confident tone and focus on operational excellence, along with ongoing share buybacks and a solid balance sheet, suggest positive investor sentiment in the short term despite modest organic growth and challenges in the consumer segment. These factors are likely to support the stock in the next couple of weeks.
