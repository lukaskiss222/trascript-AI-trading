Ceradyne reported significant declines in both quarterly and annual sales and net income, along with lowered guidance for 2009. While the company is taking steps to diversify into non-defense markets and expand internationally, the immediate outlook is overshadowed by delays in key military contracts and reduced demand in core defense segments. These factors are likely to exert downward pressure on the stock in the short term.
