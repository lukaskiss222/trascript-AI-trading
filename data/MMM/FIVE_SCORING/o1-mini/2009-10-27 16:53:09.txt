Ceradyne's third-quarter results show declining sales and reduced guidance for 2009, primarily due to lower defense contract revenues and ongoing restructuring charges. While the company is pivoting towards growth areas like solar energy and aluminum smelting, the immediate outlook is overshadowed by current financial headwinds and uncertainty around defense contracts. These factors are likely to exert downward pressure on the stock in the short term.
