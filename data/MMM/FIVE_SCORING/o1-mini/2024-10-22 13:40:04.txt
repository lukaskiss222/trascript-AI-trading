3M reported strong third-quarter performance with an 18% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share and raised the lower end of its full-year EPS guidance by $0.20. The company's focus on operational efficiency, cost-cutting measures, and strategic investments in high-growth areas like electronics and non-defense markets indicates positive momentum. While organic revenue growth remains modest at 1%, the overall outlook and improved margins are likely to positively influence the stock in the short term.
