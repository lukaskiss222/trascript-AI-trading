Ceradyne reported flat sales and reduced net income compared to last year, alongside slightly lower gross margins. Although new bookings and backlog increased, the revised guidance indicates cautious optimism amid ongoing contract uncertainties and market diversification efforts. The mixed results and tempered outlook are likely to exert downward pressure on the stock in the short term.
