3M's earnings call highlights several short-term challenges, including slower-than-expected organic growth, reduced guidance for 2023, and significant restructuring efforts such as cutting 2,500 global manufacturing roles. Additionally, the company's exit from PFAS manufacturing and ongoing litigation add further uncertainty. These factors are likely to exert downward pressure on the stock in the near term.
