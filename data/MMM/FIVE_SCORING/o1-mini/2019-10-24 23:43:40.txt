3M reported a 5% year-over-year increase in EPS and strong operational performance, highlighting effective cost management and strategic acquisitions. However, the 1.3% decline in organic sales and continued softness in key markets like China, automotive, and electronics may temper investor enthusiasm in the short term. Overall, the stock is likely to have a neutral impact over the next couple of weeks.
