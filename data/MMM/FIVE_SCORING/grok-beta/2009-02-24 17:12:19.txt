Ceradyne's strategy to achieve a 50:50 revenue mix between defense and non-defense markets while facing challenges like delayed military contracts suggests a transitional period with near-term impact. The reduced 2009 guidance indicates cautious optimism, but the focus on non-defense growth, particularly in solar and potential diversification, implies future potential. However, the immediate concerns around body armor and reduced revenues from non-defense sectors like ESK will likely exert downward pressure on the stock in the short term.
