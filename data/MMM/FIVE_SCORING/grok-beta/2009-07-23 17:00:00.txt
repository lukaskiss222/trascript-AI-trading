The 3M Companyâ€™s Q2 2009 earnings call provided several positive signals for short-term stock price movements:

- Significant sequential sales improvements were noted (12.4% ), indicating stabilization or slight growth in key markets like consumer electronics and respiratory products due to H1N1 demand.
- A robust free cash flow conversion of 160%, with a year-to-date conversion of 131%, suggests the company is managing its operations effectively, appealing to investors concerned with financial health.
- Although not explicitly stated, management's cautious outlook and ongoing cost-control measures suggest potential for sustained profitability or even margin expansion. This could reassure investors, potentially leading to a stock price surge in the short term.
