3M's Q1 2009 earnings call indicates a challenging economic environment, with substantial declines in key sectors like automotive and electronics. Despite these headwinds, the company managed to exceed internal EPS plans due to aggressive cost controls and inventory reductions. The lowered full-year EPS guidance reflects expectations of tougher end-market conditions in Q2 and minimal recovery in following quarters, suggesting a short-term bearish pressure on the stock. However, improvements in inventory absorption and potential positive developments in solar ceramics and healthcare could provide some stabilization.
