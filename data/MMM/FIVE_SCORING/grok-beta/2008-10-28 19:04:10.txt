Ceradyne's Q4 outlook suggests potential short-term headwinds for its stock price. The company faces delays with the $2.37 billion XSAPI/ESAPI contract due to a BAE protest, a reduction in body armor forecasts for 2008, and potential competitive pricing pressures in 2009. While there are positive developments in non-defense markets and strategic cost-saving measures, the near-term uncertainties related to military contracts and a significant forecasted decline in body armor sales are likely to overshadow these positives. Stock price pressure could be expected in the short term as investors digest these developments.
