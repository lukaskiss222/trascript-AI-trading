Ceradyne achieved a significant reduction in operating costs and introduced several high-margin proprietary products, such as oil and gas drilling bearing technology and solar ceramics. Expectations of a more balanced revenue stream with growth in non-defense sectors were offset by significant charge-offs, including reducing 2009 EPS guidance and anticipating a slight FY 2010 growth. However, the lower growth in the solar ceramics segment suggests some near-term softening, potentially impacting short-term stock performance.
