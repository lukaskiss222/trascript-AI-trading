3M Company showcased robust financial performance in Q2, surpassing expectations despite significant external challenges like the Japan earthquake and disruptions in consumer electronics. While these headwinds did impact specific segments, the company's diverse portfolio and strategic focus on pricing and capacity investments signal strong resilience. The tempered full-year EPS guidance, given the backdrop of these issues, along with management's optimism about better economic conditions later in the year, indicate cautious growth in the short term. However, any setbacks in the recovery of key markets or unresolved commodity price pressures could keep the stock's performance in check.
