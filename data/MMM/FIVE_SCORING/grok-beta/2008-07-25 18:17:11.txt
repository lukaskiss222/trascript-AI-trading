Ceradyneâ€™s Q2 2008 results indicate a solid performance with strong diversification efforts, although sales and earnings were slightly down year-over-year. The military contracts, particularly the XSAPI/ESAPI program, remain uncertain, but overall bookings for orders were strong, supporting a revised annual guidance of $740M-$750M in sales and EPS of $4.70-$4.80. This mix of optimism about industrial and non-defense growth, tempered by defense uncertainties, points to a mixed short-term impact on stock price, likely maintaining a neutral position.
