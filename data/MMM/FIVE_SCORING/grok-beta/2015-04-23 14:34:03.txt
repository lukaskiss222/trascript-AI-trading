3M's Q1 results demonstrated resilience with 3.3% organic growth despite currency headwinds, indicating a solid operational performance. However, the significant dollar strengthening impacted sales and profits negatively, which might create short-term pressure on the stock, particularly with revised lower guidance for 2015 EPS due to FX impacts. Positive aspects include strong margins and new acquisitions aimed at portfolio enhancement, which could mitigate some of the negative impacts over time. Therefore, while there are positive developments, the stock is poised for short-term pressure primarily due to currency issues.
