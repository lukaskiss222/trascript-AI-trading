3M's Q1 2009 earnings call highlighted a challenging quarter with unexpected declines in certain end markets like automotive and electronics. Despite the tough economic landscape, 3M maintained an impressive operating margin of 17.1%, thanks to strong cost control measures. The company expects the economic downturn to reach its bottom by mid-2009 and has adjusted its guidance accordingly. While short-term pressures remain, the company's proactive measures and resilience could steady its stock, leading to potential stabilization or modest recovery over the next 1â€“2 weeks.
