The 3M Company's first quarter 2009 earnings call painted a picture of a company navigating through a challenging economic environment. Here are the key points that influence the short-term stock price outlook:

## Challenging Economic Conditions
- The company faced significant declines in sales volumes, particularly in industries like automotive, electronics, and construction, which were down by 14% to 50%[4].
- Despite these challenges, 3M maintained a strong operating margin of 17.1% and delivered earnings above internal expectations.

## Cost Control and Restructuring
- 3M implemented significant cost-cutting measures, including a reduction of 1,200 jobs and streamlining of manufacturing operations, which helped maintain profitability[4].
- The company reduced indirect spending by 20% and cut SG&A expenses by 10% year-on-year.

## Segment Performance
- Healthcare and consumer office segments showed resilience, with healthcare posting a 2% local currency sales increase and consumer office sales being flat year-on-year[4].
- Other segments, such as industrial and transportation, electro and communications, and display and graphics, faced substantial declines.

## Guidance and Outlook
- The company provided cautious guidance for the remainder of 2009, expecting organic sales volumes to decline between 11% and 15% and EPS to be in the range of $3.90 to $4.30[4].
- Management anticipated some improvement in the economy by the end of Q2 or Q3, but with significant uncertainty.

## Financial Performance
- The strong operating margin and effective cost control were positive factors, but the overall sales decline and negative impact from inventory corrections and currency fluctuations were significant[4].

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the following reasons:

- The challenging economic conditions and significant sales declines across several key segments.
- The cautious guidance for the remainder of the year.
- The impact of inventory corrections and currency fluctuations.

However, the company's ability to maintain strong operating margins and its proactive cost-cutting measures suggest that the decline might not be as severe as it could have been.
