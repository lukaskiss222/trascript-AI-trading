The transcript for Ceradyne's third quarter 2008 earnings call presents several key points that will likely influence the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

## Reduced Body Armor Shipments
- The company anticipates a decline in body armor shipments for 2009, which is a significant portion of their revenue. This decline, despite the large ID/IQ contract, is due to the delayed shipments of XSAPI and the protest filed by BAE Systems.

## Impact of Protest and Contract Delays
- The protest against the XSAPI contract and the resulting stop-work order could delay shipments, although management expects the issue to be resolved quickly. This uncertainty may weigh on investor confidence.

## Diversification and Non-Defense Growth
- There is strong growth in non-defense areas, such as solar ceramics and ESK Ceramics, which could offset some of the decline in body armor sales. However, this growth may not immediately compensate for the reduction in high-margin defense contracts.

## Financial Performance
- The company reported lower sales and net income for Q3 2008 compared to Q3 2007, partly due to non-recurring charges. The guidance for 2009 also indicates lower sales and earnings compared to 2008.

## Cash Position and Buyback Program
- Ceradyne has a strong cash position and is continuing its stock buyback program, which could support the stock price to some extent.

Given these factors, the immediate reaction to the earnings call is likely to be negative due to the reduced guidance for 2009, the delays in XSAPI shipments, and the ongoing uncertainties in the defense contracts.
