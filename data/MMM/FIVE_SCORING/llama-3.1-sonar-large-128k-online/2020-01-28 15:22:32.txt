The earnings call for 3M Company outlined several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

1. **Mixed Financial Performance**: 3M reported a decline in organic sales and adjusted earnings, partly due to restructuring and litigation-related charges. However, the company also highlighted robust free cash flow and a strong return on invested capital[1][5].

2. **Transformation and Restructuring**: The implementation of a new global operating model and streamlined organizational structure, along with a restructuring charge, could lead to short-term inefficiencies but is expected to drive long-term efficiency and growth. This transformation may initially be viewed positively by investors due to its potential for future benefits[1][5].

3. **Guidance for 2020**: 3M provided guidance for 2020, indicating a return to growth with organic sales expected to be flat to 2% and adjusted EPS in the range of $9.30 to $9.75. This guidance, while cautious, suggests a positive outlook[1][5].

4. **Macro and Market Challenges**: The impact of the coronavirus on global markets, particularly in China, introduces uncertainty and could affect short-term performance. However, 3M is seeing increased demand for certain products like respiratory protection[1].

5. **Sustainability and PFAS Issues**: The significant litigation-related charges and ongoing PFAS issues might raise concerns but are being managed proactively, which could mitigate negative impacts on the stock[1].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience a neutral to slightly positive impact in the short term. The transformation efforts, robust cash flow, and cautiously positive 2020 guidance are positives, but the immediate challenges from coronavirus and litigation charges could temper enthusiasm.
