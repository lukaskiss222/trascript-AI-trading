The 3M Company's third-quarter 2007 earnings call presented a mix of positive and challenging aspects, which will likely influence the stock price in the short term.

### Positive Factors:
- **Record Sales and Earnings Growth**: 3M reported record third-quarter sales of $6.2 billion, with a 6.3% increase in local-currency sales and a 10.3% increase in earnings per share excluding special items.
- **Strong Operational Performance**: The company maintained strong operational discipline, with operating margins of 22.6% and double-digit sales growth in key segments like Health Care and Industrial and Transportation.
- **International Growth**: Double-digit growth in Europe, Latin America, and other international regions contributed significantly to 3M's performance.
- **Investments in R&D and Acquisitions**: 3M increased R&D expenditures by 10% and made several strategic acquisitions, indicating a commitment to long-term growth.

### Challenges:
- **Display & Graphics Segment**: The segment faced pricing and margin pressures due to a shift towards lower-end markets and increased competition. This could lead to a temporary decline in margins for this business.
- **U.S. Economic Challenges**: The company experienced softness in certain U.S. markets, such as consumer office and industrial minerals, due to the housing market slowdown and other economic factors.
- **Raw Material Costs**: 3M absorbed $35 million in commodity inflation during the quarter, which could continue to be a headwind.

### Short-Term Impact:
Given the strong overall performance, robust international growth, and continued investments in R&D and acquisitions, the negative factors such as margin pressure in the Display & Graphics segment and U.S. economic challenges are likely to be offset. Therefore, the stock is expected to maintain its positive momentum in the short term.

### Conclusion:
The positive factors outweigh the challenges, suggesting that the stock will likely experience a positive impact in the short term.
