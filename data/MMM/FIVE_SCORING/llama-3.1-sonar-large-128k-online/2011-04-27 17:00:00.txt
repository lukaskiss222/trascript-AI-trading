The 3M Company's Q1 2011 earnings call presents a mixed but overall positive outlook, despite some challenges. Here are the key points influencing the short-term impact on the stock price:

- **Strong Sales Growth**: 3M reported a 15% increase in sales, driven by organic volume growth, acquisitions, and favorable currency movements. This broad-based growth across all major geographies and business segments is a positive indicator[1][3].

- **Operational Margins**: While operating margins were down slightly due to raw material inflation and Japan-related disruptions, the company expects these factors to ease as the year progresses. Management is confident in their ability to offset raw material costs with price increases[1][3].

- **Japan Impact**: The Japan earthquake had a significant but manageable impact, estimated to affect Q2 more severely than Q1. However, the company expects this impact to wane in the second half of 2011 and potentially lead to new opportunities in reconstruction and safety equipment[1][3].

- **Guidance and Acquisitions**: 3M updated its full-year guidance to reflect continued strong growth, despite the Japan impact. The company also highlighted successful acquisitions and their integration, which are expected to contribute positively to earnings[1][3].

- **Investor Sentiment**: Despite the strong underlying performance, some analysts and investors might remain cautious due to the Japan impact, raw material inflation, and slight margin erosion. However, the overall sentiment from management is optimistic about the company's growth momentum and ability to manage challenges.

Given these points, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be positive but may be tempered by the immediate challenges such as the Japan earthquake and raw material inflation.
