The transcript of Ceradyne's Q2 2012 earnings call highlights several challenges and uncertainties that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

- **Revenue and Net Income Decline**: The company reported a decline in sales and net income compared to the same period last year, with significant reductions in crucible and body armor sales.
- **Reduced Guidance**: The guidance for 2012 has been lowered due to delays in key contracts, reduced shipments, and softness in the European economy, particularly affecting the ESK subsidiary.
- **Solar Market Weakness**: The solar business continues to be a drag, with high inventory levels and reduced demand, leading to operating losses in the crucible business.
- **Defense Contract Delays**: Delays in the Enhanced Combat Helmet production and other defense contracts add to the short-term uncertainties.
- **European Economic Softness**: The European economic crisis is impacting ESK's sales, particularly in the automotive sector.

Given these factors, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the reduced guidance, delays in key contracts, and ongoing weaknesses in the solar and European markets.
