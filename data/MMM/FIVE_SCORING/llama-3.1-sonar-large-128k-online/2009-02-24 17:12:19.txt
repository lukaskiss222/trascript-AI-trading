The transcript for Ceradyne's Q4 2008 earnings call presents several key points that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

## Revenue and Earnings
- The company reported a decline in sales and net income for Q4 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, which is a negative indicator.
- The full-year 2008 financial results also showed a decrease in sales and net income, further reinforcing the negative trend.

## Guidance
- Ceradyne revised its 2009 guidance downward, projecting lower sales ($465 million to $500 million) and earnings ($1.60 to $2 per fully diluted share), which is a significant reduction from previous expectations.

## Delays in Defense Contracts
- Delays in XSAPI production armor orders and uncertainties around future contracts could continue to weigh on investor confidence.

## Non-Defense Business
- While the company is diversifying into non-defense sectors, such as solar ceramics, and expects growth in these areas, the immediate impact of these efforts on overall revenue and profitability may not be sufficient to offset the declines in defense-related sales in the short term.

## Cost Savings and Liquidity
- The company emphasized its strong cash position and plans for cost-cutting measures, which could provide some stability. However, the immediate focus on reducing costs and managing inventory suggests a response to challenging market conditions rather than a source of short-term growth.

Given these points, the stock is likely to experience short-term pressure due to the reduced guidance, delays in key contracts, and overall economic uncertainties.
