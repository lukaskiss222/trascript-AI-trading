The transcript for Ceradyneâ€™s Q3 2009 earnings call presents a mixed picture that is likely to have a negative short-term impact on the stock price. Here are the key points:

- **Reduced Guidance**: The company adjusted its full-year 2009 guidance downward, from $0.70 to $0.60 per fully diluted share, and reduced sales estimates from $420 million to $410-415 million. This lower guidance is a significant negative indicator[5|.
- **Decline in Body Armor Sales**: There is a substantial decline in body armor sales, from $180 million in 2009 to a projected $90-120 million in 2010, which is a major contributor to the overall revenue decrease[5|.
- **Restructuring and Impairment Charges**: The company incurred significant restructuring and impairment charges, totaling $17.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, which negatively impacted earnings per share[5|.
- **Mixed Performance in Other Segments**: While there are some positive notes about growth in non-defense sectors such as solar energy, aluminum smelting, and oil & gas drilling, these areas are not yet sufficient to offset the decline in the defense business[5|.
- **Cost-Cutting and Restructuring Efforts**: The company is in the process of restructuring, particularly in Europe, and these efforts are ongoing, indicating continued challenges[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the reduced guidance, significant decline in body armor sales, and ongoing restructuring efforts.
