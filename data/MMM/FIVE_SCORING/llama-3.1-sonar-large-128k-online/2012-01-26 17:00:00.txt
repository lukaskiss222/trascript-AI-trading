The 3M Company's fourth-quarter earnings call for 2011 presented a mixed outlook with several key points that could influence the stock price in the short term:

## Positive Factors:
- **Record Sales and Earnings**: 3M reported record fourth-quarter sales of $7.1 billion and full-year sales of $29.6 billion, with earnings per share increasing by 5.9% to $5.96[3][4].
- **Strong Cash Flow**: The company generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter and returned $4.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases[3][4].
- **Diversified Growth**: Many business segments, such as Industrial and Transportation, Safety, Security and Protection Services, and Health Care, showed strong growth, indicating a robust business model[3][4].

## Negative Factors:
- **Challenging First Half of 2012**: Management expects slower growth in the first half of 2012, particularly due to weak consumer electronics demand, economic challenges in Western Europe, and inventory adjustments[3][4].
- **Cost Pressures and Restructuring**: The company is implementing cost-saving measures and restructuring, which may impact short-term profitability. There are also increased pension and postretirement benefits expenses expected in 2012[3][4].
- **Acquisition Impact**: The acquisition of Avery Dennison's office and consumer products business, while expected to be beneficial long-term, is not yet included in the 2012 guidance and may introduce some short-term integration costs[3][4].

Given these factors, the short-term outlook for 3M's stock is likely to be influenced by the anticipated slower growth in the first half of 2012 and the ongoing cost pressures. However, the company's strong cash flow, diversified growth, and long-term strategic initiatives suggest resilience.

**Conclusion:**
The stock is likely to experience some short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance and economic challenges but will remain supported by its strong underlying business model and long-term growth prospects.
