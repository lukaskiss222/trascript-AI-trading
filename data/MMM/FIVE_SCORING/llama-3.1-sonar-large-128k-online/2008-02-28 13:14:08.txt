The earnings transcript for Ceradyne Inc. indicates several factors that are likely to impact the stock price in the short term (1-2 weeks):

1. **Reduced Guidance for 2008**: The company has lowered its 2008 guidance due to delays in XSAPI/ESAPI military contracts and a reduction in body armor shipments. This reduction in guidance is likely to be viewed negatively by investors.

2. **Delays and Uncertainties**: The repeated delays in the XSAPI/ESAPI contract awards and the uncertainty around the BULL combat vehicle production orders introduce significant uncertainty, which can lead to investor caution.

3. **Cost Reductions and Workforce Cuts**: The announcement of workforce reductions and cost-cutting measures, while aimed at rationalizing costs, may be seen as a sign of challenges in the defense segment.

4. **Positive Non-Defense Growth**: However, the company's optimistic outlook on non-defense markets, particularly in solar ceramics and other industrial applications, provides a positive counterbalance.

Given these factors, the short-term impact on the stock price is likely to be negative due to the reduced guidance, delays, and uncertainties, despite the positive long-term growth prospects in non-defense segments.

**Rating: -1**
