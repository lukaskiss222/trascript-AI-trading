The transcript for Ceradyne's 2008 second quarter results call presents a mixed outlook that could influence the stock price in the short term. Here are the key points:

### Positive Indicators
- **Better Than Expected Performance**: The company reported better than expected results for the first half of 2008, leading to an increase in revenue and earnings guidance for the year[3].
- **Diversification and Growth**: Ceradyne is making significant strides in diversifying its business, with growth in non-defense sectors such as solar ceramics, automotive, and industrial sales. This diversification is helping to offset declines in body armor revenue[3].
- **Acquisitions and Expansion**: The company is actively pursuing acquisitions (e.g., SemEquip) and expanding its facilities, particularly in China, which indicates a strong strategic direction[3].

### Negative Indicators
- **Delayed and Uncertain Defense Contracts**: Delays in XSAPI/ESAPI military contracts and the uncertainty around MRAP II (BULL) deliveries could impact short-term revenue and profitability[3].
- **Margin Pressures**: The transition to XSAPI production may come with start-up issues that could lower margins in the second half of the year[3].
- **Dependence on Government Contracts**: The company's revenue is still heavily dependent on government contracts, which can be unpredictable and subject to changes in mission requirements and budget allocations[3].

### Conclusion
Given the mixed signals, the stock is likely to face some short-term pressure due to the uncertainties around key defense contracts and potential margin pressures. However, the strong performance in the first half and the company's proactive diversification efforts suggest stability and potential for long-term growth.
