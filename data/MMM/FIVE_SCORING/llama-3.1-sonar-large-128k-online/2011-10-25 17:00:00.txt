The 3M Company's third-quarter earnings call for 2011 revealed several key points that suggest a short-term negative impact on the stock price:

- **Lowered Guidance**: 3M adjusted its full-year 2011 sales and earnings expectations downward, which is typically a negative signal for investors[4].
- **Economic Challenges**: The company faced significant challenges, including concerns about European sovereign debt and a rapid contraction in electronics end markets, which impacted their sales and profitability[5].
- **Organic Volume Growth**: Organic volume growth slowed significantly, particularly in Western Europe, and the overall organic volume growth for the company was reduced by nearly 4 percentage points[5].
- **Margin Pressure**: Gross margins declined due to under-absorbed overheads, and operating margins were affected by weakening demand in certain segments[5].
- **Inventory and Demand Issues**: The company anticipated continued weak demand in areas like Optical and Electronics, and expected year-end shutdowns in some factories, indicating ongoing challenges in the fourth quarter[5].

Given these factors, the stock is likely to face short-term pressure due to the tempered guidance, economic uncertainties, and specific segment challenges.

**Rating: -1**
