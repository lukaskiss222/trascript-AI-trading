Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess a positive short-term impact on 3M's stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Strong organic growth of 5.8% in Q3, significantly accelerating from 2% in H1 2013, with all business segments showing growth
2. Operating margins remained robust at 22% with all business segments above 20%
3. Management expressed confidence in Q4 outlook while making strategic investments for future growth
4. Strong cash flow and increased share buyback program indicates financial strength

However, the impact is likely to be moderately rather than strongly positive due to:
- Some caution on Q4 electronics segment outlook
- Heavy investment spending impacting near-term margins
- Narrowed full-year guidance range
