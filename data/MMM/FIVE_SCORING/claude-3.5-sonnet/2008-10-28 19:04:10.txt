Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that this will likely have a negative short-term impact on the stock price for the following key reasons:

1. The company reduced 2009 guidance significantly, projecting $640-650M in sales vs 2008's $695-700M, with EPS dropping from $4.00-4.15 to $3.00-3.25.

2. There are near-term headwinds in their core body armor business, including a protest from BAE Systems delaying a major $72M XSAPI order and overall lower expected shipments in 2009.

3. While management highlighted growth in non-defense segments like solar crucibles, these aren't yet large enough to offset the decline in their main defense business which will still be 40% of revenues.
