Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on 3M's stock price. The company reported strong Q1 results with broad-based growth across businesses and geographies, exceeding their own expectations. Key positives include:

1. Record Q1 EPS of $1.49, up 16% year-over-year
2. Strong organic growth of 9% with double-digit growth in most segments
3. Raised full-year organic growth guidance despite Japan earthquake impact
4. Maintained healthy operating margins around 21.6%
5. Demonstrated pricing power to offset raw material inflation

While there are some headwinds (Japan impact, optical systems inventory correction), management appears to be managing them well and the company's diversified portfolio provides resilience. The confident tone from executives and raised guidance suggests momentum will continue.
