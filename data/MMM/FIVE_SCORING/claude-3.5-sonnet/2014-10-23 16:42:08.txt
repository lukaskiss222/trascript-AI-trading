Based on the earnings call transcript, I'm quite positive about 3M's near-term stock outlook. Key positives include:

1. Strong Q3 execution with record sales and margins across all business segments, beating expectations
2. Robust 6% organic growth in US market, suggesting domestic strength
3. Consistent margin expansion through productivity initiatives and portfolio optimization
4. Healthy cash flow generation and increasing shareholder returns
5. Management confidence in navigating mixed global environment, particularly in Europe and China

While there are some headwinds like FX and pension costs heading into 2015, the company appears well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory and profitability through operational excellence and strategic investments.
