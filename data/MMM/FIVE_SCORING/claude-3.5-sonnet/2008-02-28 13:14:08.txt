Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a negative short-term impact on the stock price for the following key reasons:

1. Significant guidance reduction for 2008: Company lowered both revenue ($715M-$836M vs previous $780M-$1.067B) and EPS ($4.55-$5.05 vs previous $5.60-$6.65) guidance due to delays in key military contracts and reduced body armor shipments.

2. Near-term headwinds in core business: A 4-month gap in ESAPI body armor production and $80M reduction in body armor revenue signals material weakness in their highest-margin segment. While management is optimistic about diversification efforts, these will take time to materially impact results.

3. Uncertainty around major programs: Both the XSAPI/ESAPI contract award and BULL combat vehicle program face delays and unclear timing, creating near-term uncertainty that will likely pressure the stock.

While there are some positive longer-term developments in solar and industrial markets, the significant guidance cut and near-term challenges in core segments will likely drive negative sentiment over the next 1-2 weeks.
