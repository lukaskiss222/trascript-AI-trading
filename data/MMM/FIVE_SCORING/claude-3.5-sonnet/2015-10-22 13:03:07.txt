Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess that 3M's stock is likely to have a slightly positive impact in the 1-2 week timeframe. Here's my reasoning:

While organic growth was modest at 1.2% and guidance was lowered, there were several positives:

1. Strong margin expansion to 24.3% (+90 bps YoY) across all business segments despite macro headwinds, demonstrating operational excellence
2. Proactive cost reduction/restructuring announced ($130M savings in 2016)
3. Strong cash flow generation and capital return to shareholders
4. Management appears to be executing well on strategic initiatives (portfolio optimization, ERP implementation)

The company is navigating a challenging macro environment effectively through cost controls and operational improvements, which should support the stock price in the near-term despite growth challenges.
