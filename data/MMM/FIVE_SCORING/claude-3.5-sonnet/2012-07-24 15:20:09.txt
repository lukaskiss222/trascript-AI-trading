Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately negative short-term impact on the stock price for the following key reasons:

1. The company lowered their full year guidance significantly, reducing revenue expectations from $540M to $475-485M and cutting EPS by $0.30-0.50 due to multiple headwinds.

2. Major challenges persist in their solar business with crucible shipments down 82% YoY, leading to operating losses. European operations are also seeing weakness.

3. While management expressed long-term optimism about diversification efforts and new products, near-term headwinds in core defense and solar segments will likely pressure results over the next few quarters.

The combination of reduced guidance, continued weakness in key segments, and lack of clear near-term catalysts suggests the stock will face selling pressure over the next 1-2 weeks as investors digest the deteriorating outlook.
