Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a modestly negative short-term impact on the stock price for the following key reasons:

1. The company reduced its 2009 guidance, lowering full-year EPS expectations from $0.70 to $0.60 and revenue from $420M to $410-415M.

2. Body armor sales, a key segment, are expected to decline significantly from $180M in 2009 to $90-120M in 2010, creating uncertainty around revenue growth.

3. While management highlighted growth opportunities in industrial/solar segments, these are longer-term initiatives that likely won't offset near-term defense revenue declines.

The guidance reduction and expected decline in core defense business will likely pressure the stock in the coming weeks, though this is partially offset by cost-cutting efforts and diversification initiatives.
