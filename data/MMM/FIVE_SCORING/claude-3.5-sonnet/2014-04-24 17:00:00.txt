Based on the earnings call transcript, I assess 3M's short-term stock outlook as moderately positive. Key supporting factors:

1. Strong Q1 results with broad-based organic growth across all business segments and geographic regions, with particularly robust performance in healthcare and improving margins in electronics

2. Management reaffirmed full-year guidance despite currency headwinds, demonstrating confidence in their outlook

3. Pricing power remains strong with 1.2% price increases, while benefiting from lower raw material costs 

However, some offsetting factors include continued investment spending impacting margins and uncertainty around currency impacts. Overall, the company appears well-positioned to deliver steady growth and returns in the near term.
