Based on this earnings call transcript, I assess a moderately positive short-term impact on 3M's stock price. Key positives include:

- Record quarterly sales of $7.8B
- Strong margins at 22% (22.4% adjusted)
- Solid free cash flow of $1.3B with 107% conversion
- Increased share buyback program from $2-3B to $3.5-4.5B
- Strong Health Care segment performance with 6% organic growth
- Management confidence in H2 recovery

Some offsetting factors include:

- Modest 2.3% organic growth
- Continued weakness in electronics/energy segment
- Currency headwinds
- Conservative guidance maintained

However, the overall tone was constructive with management expressing confidence in improving conditions in H2 2013. The increased buyback and strong cash generation also provide support.
