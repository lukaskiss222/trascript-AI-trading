Based on this earnings transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on 3M's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. The company reported exceptional Q1 results with sales growing 25%, strong margins at 22.8%, and earnings beating expectations significantly. Management raised full-year guidance substantially for both sales (10-12% vs. previous 5-7%) and EPS ($5.40-5.60 vs. $4.90-5.10). Growth was broad-based across segments and regions, with particularly strong performance in Asia. While management noted some caution around H1N1 sales declining and raw material costs increasing, the overall tone was very confident about continued momentum.
