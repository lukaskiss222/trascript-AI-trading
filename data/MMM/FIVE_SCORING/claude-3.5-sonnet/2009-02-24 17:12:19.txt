Based on the earnings call transcript, I believe this will have a negative short-term impact on the stock price for the following reasons:

1. The company significantly lowered its 2009 guidance from $2.30 EPS to $1.60-$2.00 EPS and revenue guidance from $600M to $465-500M, citing delays in armor orders and uncertainty in industrial markets, particularly in Europe.

2. The company's ESK division in Europe is struggling and may only break even in 2009, with potential facility closures being considered.

3. While there are some positive long-term opportunities in solar and defense, the near-term outlook shows significant headwinds with Q1 2009 EPS projected at only $0.25-$0.30.
