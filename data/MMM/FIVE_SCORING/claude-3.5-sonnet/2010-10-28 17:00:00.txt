Based on the earnings call transcript, I anticipate a positive short-term impact on 3M's stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include:

- Strong Q3 results with 11% organic growth and record operating income
- Broad-based growth across geographies and segments, with emerging markets up 25%
- Healthy margins maintained at 23% across all segments
- Strategic acquisitions expanding growth platforms
- Upbeat outlook with 11% revenue growth targeted for 2011

While there are some headwinds (LCD TV inventory correction, H1N1 comps, rising raw material costs), the overall tone was confident and the company appears well-positioned with its diversified portfolio and emerging market exposure. Management's transparent discussion of challenges while maintaining guidance suggests credibility.
