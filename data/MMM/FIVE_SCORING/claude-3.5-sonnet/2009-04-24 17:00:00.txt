Based on the earnings transcript, 3M faced significant challenges in Q1 2009 with organic sales down 19.5% and weaker end markets than expected. However, management maintained strong operating margins at 17.1%, demonstrated effective cost control, and provided guidance suggesting gradual improvement by year-end. While near-term headwinds persist, the company's diversified portfolio, cost reduction initiatives, and market positioning should help weather the downturn. The stock is likely to see modest upside in the next 1-2 weeks given management's cautiously optimistic outlook and signs of stabilization in some end markets, particularly in Asia.
