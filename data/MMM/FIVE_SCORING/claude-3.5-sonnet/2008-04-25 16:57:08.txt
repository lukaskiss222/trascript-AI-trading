Based on the earnings transcript, I anticipate a slight negative short-term impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. While the company maintained guidance and showed progress in diversifying beyond defense, there are several concerning factors: margins declined by 3 percentage points, body armor sales dropped significantly, and there is uncertainty around timing of key defense contracts (XSAPI/MRAP II). The transition toward non-defense revenue, while strategically sound long-term, is creating near-term margin pressure. The positive developments in solar and industrial markets are not likely to fully offset these headwinds in the very short term.
