Based on this earnings call transcript, I anticipate a moderately positive short-term impact on the stock price over the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include strong Q2 execution with margins above expectations, confirmation of XSAPI/ESAPI qualification, and continued diversification into non-defense markets like solar and oil/gas. While there are some headwinds from reduced MRAP II expectations and XSAPI transition costs, management provided increased guidance for 2008 and demonstrated good operational control. The company's strategic expansion into new markets and technologies while maintaining core defense capabilities should be viewed favorably by investors.
