Based on the earnings call transcript, I see mixed signals but with an overall positive bias heading into the next 1-2 weeks. Key positives include:

- Strong international growth, particularly in Europe and Latin America
- Healthy margins maintained while increasing R&D investment
- Double-digit growth in Healthcare and Industrial segments
- Management expressed confidence in executing their strategic plan

Some concerns include:
- Optical films price/margin pressure
- US consumer market showing signs of weakness  
- Raw material cost pressures of $35M in the quarter
- Slower growth in some US consumer segments

However, management came across as confident and proactive in addressing challenges while maintaining their full-year guidance. The diversified portfolio helps offset segment-specific headwinds.
